They either go without food or buy unhealthy food because that\u0027s what they can afford and get hold of.\u0027The Government knows about the problem. It\u0027s time to stop the dither and delay, endless talking and consultation, and get on with it.\u0027Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, added: \u0027This report shows that millions of families can\u0027t eat well unless they have sufficient income and an environment which makes the healthy choice the easiest.\u0027People can no longer wait for lengthy Government consultations which languish in Whitehall.\u0027Every day that passes where the odds are stacked against families securing a healthy diet is a missed opportunity to secure a healthy future for our children.\u0027One in five people in Britain live in poverty and this country has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the European Union, accounting for 20 per cent of all severely food insecure people in Europe.\u0027The report added that adults and children living in the most deprived areas are about twice as likely to be obese than those living in the least deprived areas, contributing to a difference in healthy life expectancy of about 20 years.The committee called on the government to measure how many people live with food insecurity and to analyse why, to understand the cost of a healthy diet and to incorporate this into benefits calculations, and to curb excessive advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods.It also suggests that food initiatives for disadvantaged children, such as free school meals, must be properly funded.And it added that an independent body should be established to oversee the implementation of a National Food Strategy that reports annually to Parliament and that the Agriculture Bill must be used to encourage the production and consumption of healthier food.Commenting on the report, Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u0027This report should serve as an urgent wake-up call to the Government.\u0027Families should be able to access not only enough food, but also the food that they need to stay healthy. \u0027With over 200,000 children pushed into poverty by the coronavirus crisis, our members know that many will go hungry unless radical steps are taken immediately.\u0027She added: \u00274.5million children will be trapped in poverty by Christmas – government must act now to implement a nationwide strategic plan to increase household incomes and release families from the shame and indignity of having to rely on foodbanks and food voucher schemes.\u0027A government spokeswoman said: \u0027We currently spend a record £95billion a year on our welfare system, with a further injection of £6.5billion in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \u0027We are also giving an additional £63million for local authorities to assist those most in need of food and essential supplies.\u0027The upcoming National Food Strategy will look at the entire food system, from field to fork, to ensure it delivers safe, healthy, affordable food, regardless of where people live or how much they earn.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Buck moon wows skywatchers world","story":"Share this articleJuly 2020: The Next Full Moon is the Buck Moon – NASA Solar System ExplorationThe \u0027Buck Moon\u0027 lunar eclipse this Fourth of July will be hard to see | Space"},{"url":null,"title":"Ex MP Charlie Elphicke chanted Im naughty Tory chased horrified woman home","story":"Share this article Ms Marshall added: \u0027What happened next was very quick. He placed his knee between her legs, he was directly above her and tried to kiss her.\u0027She moved her head back. He then put his hand into her dress, reached in and grabbed her right breast and started squeezing it.\u0027The court heard that the woman then jumped up, resulting in father of two Elphicke chasing her around the house.Ms Marshall described it as a sketch out of a Benny Hill show but told the court that the incident was anything but lighthearted.The woman became so distressed that she was forced to lock herself in a room, fearing for her life as Elphicke stood outside, continuing to scream: \u0027I\u0027m a naughty Tory.\u0027The court heard that he finally calmed down and went away, enabling the woman to leave the house. She called a taxi and went to her boyfriend\u0027s house, where she immediately told him what had happened.Elphicke represented the Conservatives from 2010 until November 2017, when he was suspended from the party after the allegations of sexual assault were referred to the police.Last November, he was replaced as MP for Dover by his wife Natalie Elphicke who was then elected to represent the constituency with a 12,000 majority at the General Election.The court heard that the second alleged attack in April 2016 took place in a Parliamentary building as Elphicke shared a bottle of champagne with a female Parliamentary worker in her early 20s.Ms Marshall said that the drink had been arranged following a crucial debate on an immigration bill followed by Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, which Elphicke was concerned about.As he drank champagne with the young woman, he \u0027suddenly lunged at her\u0027 and \u0027forcibly kissed her on the lips,\u0027 which the victim described to police as a \u0027disgusting, slobbery mess.\u0027Elphicke is then alleged to have put his hand down her dress and \u0027groped her breast.\u0027Ms Marshall told the jury: \u0027The victim squirmed and pushed him away. She felt like an idiot.\u0027The court heard that Elphicke\u0027s response was to ask her \u0027what\u0027s the matter, don\u0027t you like me?\u0027Distressed by the incident, the woman left the office and walked to a nearby Tube station with Elphicke, who tried to kiss her again, telling her: \u0027I\u0027m naughty, sometimes, aren\u0027t I? I can be so badly behaved, but I can\u0027t help it.\u0027The jury heard that the woman was fearful that if she complained against Elphicke then it could have jeopardised her career, but she confided in a number of friends about what had taken place.Ms Marshall said: \u0027She was worried about what he (Elphicke) was going to do because she had clearly rejected him.\u0027The trial, before Mrs Justice Whipple is expected to last four weeks with both Elphicke and his wife Natalie giving evidence as well as around a dozen other witnesses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99abfcaca7bc3116dd7fd21bf4eb48eaec31792e/0_493_2278_1367/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=015e29874d1ce0ec5b294d53ab1421d8","title":"it gives me something to hold on to readers art in lockdown coronavirus","story":"We asked you to show us the artwork you have created during coronavirus lockdownMy father was diagnosed with terminal cancer on Christmas Eve and called me at 6pm to tell us. We had no idea. He had been going for tests but hadn’t told us. He became unwell quickly, to the point that my sister and I had to swap care the day before lockdown so he would have someone with him. I joined her and her partner to care for him in the final couple of weeks, when all I could do was draw as the waiting and stress were unbearable for us all.He couldn’t manage conversation so it gave me a role to sit silently beside him, drawing the garden he designed so beautifully. In the following excruciating days it was the only thing that felt remotely OK. We had no palliative cancer team because of Covid, but had a fabulous GP and district nursing team for the last few days. Seeing his garden appearing through the end of my pen gives me something to hold on to. Kara ChristineI was inspired by all of the key workers during the pandemic as my parents both work for the NHS. I wanted to design something as a tribute to everyone, from cleaners to bin men, putting in the effort especially for those who have been forgotten. Niamh McBrideLockdown has given everyday objects I took for granted a deep and renewed significance. Every single day I see, use and sometimes even talk to them. Recently I have become fixated with a bathroom sink – the one I wash my hands in for 20 seconds every time I come inside. I am furloughed from my job and I shut myself in to a tiny downstairs bathroom and spend hours drawing or painting it each day, whether I feel happy, anxious, upset, excited, or just bored. The sink has become a mirror of how I feel, an image of the claustrophobia of lockdown, and, in a strange way, a companion. Claire ParkerI have painted nearly every day during lockdown as a form of therapy, as well as a great mindfulness activity. I was inspired to paint this picture of Rachel on her roof, not only because it was such an unusual, wistful pose, but also no doubt a reflection of the anxiety and frustration felt by many young people during the lockdown. Vicki Maguire, BelfastDuring the early weeks of lockdown here in France I came across these trees in an empty railway station. They were completely bare in the early morning sun and looked as if they were grasping for something. It seemed to sum up how I felt at the time. Now that restrictions have been relaxed and things appear to be less surreal, the tress are covered in dense, lush foliage. James O’HanlonI work in TV as a graphic designer but, with my show on hiatus during lockdown, I have been trying out lots of types of art. This is the first time in years that I’ve had time to be creative outside of work. I’ve set up a weekly challenge with my friends. Tasks have ranged from making a pet from recycling to writing a song. I’ve done lots of painting and sculpture using things lying around my house. Caroline Sandford-MuirDuring lockdown I have mainly been drawing birds. I have never seen such an abundance and variety of birds – both in my garden and when walking locally. I don’t think most people, including myself, have seen spring happen like we have had the opportunity to this year. It has been incredibly inspiring. Jessica WhiteI live in Oslo and my normal urban wandering and museum visits have been abruptly curtailed, so I have been forced to wander through the city in my head. It is absolutely necessary to create art if one is denied viewing it. I normally experience an uptick in my desire to paint as the sun appears here, but I have had an almost manic need to paint since the lockdown. This has been to the detriment of my ability to work at home. Steven GershPrior to lockdown I created illustrations for newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, with print circulation and advertising revenue shrinking, the publications that commissioned me have stopped calling. I also make art just for the sake of it as an indulgence just for me.My output has always been prolific and has relied on using whatever resources I can get hold off. Be that envelopes, Amazon packaging or found objects. Upcyling may be trendy but, as many artists have discovered, it’s the only way we can obtain the raw materials we need to continue to be creative. However, the first non-essential shopping I do when lockdown lifts will be to replenish art supplies. My glue stash is running precariously low. David SmithI haven’t painted before, other than my GCGEs 25 years ago, and really had no idea I could paint. It’s freaked me out slightly. I can’t quite believe I painted these. It just came out of nowhere. I painted this one for my mum’s birthday, based on a scene near where she lives in Marple, near Stockport. Paul LomaxI made art when I was younger but being in lockdown and the events that are happening around me, has inspired me to take up my paintbrush again. After the tragic death of George Floyd I felt an overwhelming sense of emotion, which inspired me to create this portrait of him. I also wanted to pay tribute and show that I support the black lives matter movement in my own way. Ruby DjordjevicInitially in lockdown I was doing some landscapes from drawings I made in March. When I ran out of inspiration, the images of the virus started to interest me and I have produced a number of pictures of it in response. I’ve been dabbling and daubing all my life. I believe that those of us lucky enough to be able to do it solely for pleasure should share it by giving our work away.

leicester factory conditions covid 19","story":"Workers were paid £3.50 an hour in conditions that allegedly put them at greater risk of Covid-19The online fashion retailer Boohoo has pledged to investigate how its clothes came to be made by a Leicester garment factory where workers were paid just £3.50 an hour in conditions that allegedly put them at greater risk of catching Covid-19.Boohoo, which owns brands such as Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal, said conditions at the Jaswal Fashions factory in Leicester were “totally unacceptable and fall woefully short of any standards acceptable in any workplace”.Sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have helped fuel rapid growth that could put its bosses in line for bonuses worth £150m as part of a three-year bonus scheme.But Boohoo, which had a surge sales during the pandemic, said it was not sure who was supplying its garments.“Our early investigations have revealed that Jaswal Fashions is not a declared supplier and is also no longer trading as a garment manufacturer,” it said in a statement to investors in the company, which floated on the stock market in 2014.“It therefore appears that a different company is using Jaswal’s former premises and we are currently trying to establish the identity of this company.“We are taking immediate action to thoroughly investigate how our garments were in their hands, will ensure that our suppliers immediately cease working with this company, and we will urgently review our relationship with any suppliers who have subcontracted work to the manufacturer in question.”It comes after an undercover reporter for the Sunday Times found staff being paid as little as £3.50 an hour in the factory, even though the minimum wage in Britain for those aged 25 and over is £8.72.Priti Patel, the home secretary, asked the National Crime Agency to investigate modern slavery in Leicester’s clothing factories last week, after whistleblowers raised the alarm about conditions.Leicester has been the site of a localised coronavirus outbreak, with cramped conditions and lax safety measures in some garment factories thought to have played a role in transmission of the virus.Boohoo had previously said none of its suppliers had been affected.On Monday, the company said: “We are keen and willing to work with local officials to raise standards because we are absolutely committed to eradicating any instance of non-compliance and to ensuring the actions of a few do not continue to undermine the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area, who provide good jobs and good working conditions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443f4f7b944df4f3b9788400d66df89149b3c032/32_47_984_590/master/984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92d2507ddf0b6f0f863a4ab64c67a91e","title":"giant flywheel project in scotland could prevent uk blackouts energy","story":"Trailblazing system would help to stabilise the energy grid’s electrical frequencyA giant flywheel in north-east Scotland could soon help to prevent blackouts across Britain by mimicking the effect of a power station but without using fossil fuels.The trailblazing project near Keith in Moray, thought to cost about £25m, will not generate electricity or produce carbon emissions – but it could help keep the lights on by stabilising the energy grid’s electrical frequency.The Norwegian energy company Statkraft hopes that from next winter the new flywheel, designed by a ision of General Electric, will be able to mimic the spinning turbines of a traditional power station, which have helped to balance the grid’s frequency at about 50 hertz for decades.Currently, the National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is forced to shut down windfarms and run gas power stations even when there is more than enough renewable energy to meet Britain’s electricity demand, in order to keep the grid’s frequency steady.By simulating the spinning metal mass of a power station turbine without producing emissions, Statkraft should be able to help ESO rely less on fossil fuels and use renewable energy more.This is the first time a project of this kind will be used anywhere in the world and ESO believes it could be a “huge step forward” in running a zero-carbon electricity grid.The task of keeping the electrical frequency of the grid steady is becoming more challenging because Britain’s growing stable of renewable energy projects do not use the same giant spinning turbines that typically help to keep frequency stable.In August last year more than a million people across the UK were plunged into darkness during one of the worst power blackouts in more than a decade after the frequency of the grid fell to 48.88Hz.Since then, National Grid ESO has accelerated plans for new blackout safeguards to avoid another energy system shock, including schemes and new technologies that can help protect the grid’s frequency without increasing its carbon footprint.“Our contracts for stability services with providers such as Statkraft are cheaper and greener, reducing emissions and saving money for electricity consumers,” said Julian Leslie, the head of networks at National Grid ESO. “This approach is the first of its kind anywhere in the world and is a huge step forward in our ambition to be able to operate the GB electricity system carbon-free by 2025.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639e7fbddbcef53b8634f20f1fd8e056946bb5c8/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5b95cacf06f12af854b59d8f8f4b2e","title":"coronavirus covid 19 mild symptoms who","story":"Otherwise healthy people who thought they had recovered from coronavirus are reporting persistent and strange symptoms - including strokesThroughout the pandemic, a notion has persevered that people who have “mild” cases of Covid-19 and do not require an ICU stay or the use of a ventilator are spared from serious health repercussions. Just last week, Mike Pence, the US vice-president, claimed it’s “a good thing” that nearly half of the new Covid-19 cases surging in 16 states are young Americans, who are at less risk of becoming severely ill than their older counterparts. This kind of rhetoric would lead you to believe that the ordeal of “mildly infected” patients ends within two weeks of becoming ill, at which point they recover and everything goes back to normal.While that may be the case for some people who get Covid-19, emerging medical research as well as anecdotal evidence from recovery support groups suggest that many survivors of “mild” Covid-19 are not so lucky. They experience lasting side-effects, and doctors are still trying to understand the ramifications.Some of these side effects can be fatal. According to Dr Christopher Kellner, a professor of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, “mild” cases of Covid-19 in which the patient was not hospitalized for the virus have been linked to blood clotting and severe strokes in people as young as 30. In May, Kellner told Healthline that Mount Sinai had implemented a plan to give anticoagulant drugs to people with Covid-19 to prevent the strokes they were seeing in “younger patients with no or mild symptoms”.Doctors now know that Covid-19 not only affects the lungs and blood, but kidneys, liver and brain – the last potentially resulting in chronic fatigue and depression, among other symptoms. Although the virus is not yet old enough for long-term effects on those organs to be well understood, they may manifest regardless of whether a patient ever required hospitalization, hindering their recovery process.After being diagnosed with Covid-19, 26-year-old Fiona Lowenstein experienced a long, difficult and nonlinear recovery first-hand. Lowenstein became sick on 17 March, and was briefly hospitalized for fever, cough and shortness of breath. Doctors advised she return to the hospital if those symptoms worsened – but something else happened instead. “I experienced this whole slew of new symptoms: sinus pain, sore throat, really severe gastrointestinal issues,” she told me. “I was having diarrhea every time I ate. I lost a lot of weight, which made me weak, a lot of fatigue, headaches, loss of sense of smell …”By the time she felt mostly better, it was mid-May, although some of her symptoms still routinely re-emerge, she says.“It’s almost like a blow to your ego to be in your 20s and healthy and active, and get hit with this thing and think you’re going to get better and you’re going to be OK. And then have it really not pan out that way,” says Lowenstein.Unable to find information about what she was experiencing, and wondering if more people were going through a similarly prolonged recovery, Lowenstein created The Body Politic Slack-channel support group, a forum that now counts more than 5,600 members – most of whom were not hospitalized for their illness, yet have been feeling sick for months after their initial flu-like respiratory symptoms subsided. According to an internal survey within the group, members – the vast majority of whom are under 50 – have experienced symptoms including facial paralysis, seizures, hearing and vision loss, headaches, memory loss, diarrhea, serious weight loss and more.“To me, and I think most people, the definition of ‘mild’, passed down from the WHO and other authorities, meant any case that didn’t require hospitalization at all, that anyone who wasn’t hospitalized was just going to have a small cold and could take care of it at home,” Hannah Davis, the author of a patient-led survey of Body Politic members, told me. “From my point of view, this has been a really harmful narrative and absolutely has misinformed the public. It both prohibits people from taking relevant information into account when deciding their personal risk levels, and it prevents the long-haulers from getting the help they need.”At this stage, when medical professionals and the public alike are learning about Covid-19 as the pandemic unfolds, it’s important to keep in mind how little we truly know about this vastly complicated disease – and to listen to the experiences of survivors, especially those whose recoveries have been neither quick nor straightforward.It may be reassuring to describe the majority of Covid-19 cases as “mild” – but perhaps that term isn’t as accurate as we hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66052c13bdf5f6f153fcc7bb9731a884cd1340e/0_324_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e3dfde1e2eabda5c98fd8b2e04cb05","title":"pandemic momentum labour party moderates fractured leftwing","story":"‘Moderates’ can only offer sticking plasters in response to the coronavirus crisis. The party’s fractured left wing must rebuildAs the Labour left attempts to regroup following the twin defeats of December’s general election and the subsequent party leadership contest, Momentum is under new management. In a fractious set of elections to its national coordinating group (NCG), the Forward Momentum slate emerged triumphant over its rival, Momentum Renewal. Now, at a moment of great political urgency, the organisation must answer an existential question: in the post-Corbyn era, what is Momentum for?Granted, to outsiders – and, given the low turnout, most Momentum members – the source of the antagonism between the competing slates must seem quite obscure hackneyed Life of Brian gags have again been thrown around with abandon. However, the fundamental problems with Momentum today are rooted in its lack of political clarity, as previously argued by Momentum Renewal candidate Max Shanly. Originally rushed into being in 2015 to defend Jeremy Corbyn’s embattled leadership of the Labour party, Momentum has struggled to develop any substantial objectives beyond this original purpose.Although it initially harboured vague aspirations of putting itself at the centre of a broader social movement, how it might do so was never really elaborated on. Instead, it fell to Momentum to simultaneously supply the Labour left’s organisational muscle for winning votes at party conferences and in candidate selections, provide an auxiliary PR operation for Corbyn, and turn itself into a well-drilled election campaigning machine. Unsurprisingly, the fledgling organisation was ultimately overwhelmed by its various responsibilities.Hence, the challenges are already piling up for the new, Forward Momentum-dominated NCG. For starters, it is now faced with the unenviable task of engineering a single leftwing slate for the impending elections to Labour’s national executive committee (NEC). The NEC elections that took place concurrently with the recent Labour leadership contest saw leftist votes splintered hither and thither among rival Corbynite candidates, handing the party’s right wing a majority which (unlike the left under Corbyn) it has not hesitated to use.But reconstructing Momentum, if it is to find an effective post-Corbyn role, must go much further. Its local branches, largely withered on the vine, need to be revived. With Labour’s community organising unit facing an uncertain future under the new party leadership, it may be left to Momentum to fill the void as best it can (albeit with much more limited resources). In addition, it will need to offer a lead with regard to socialist political education, organising in constituency parties, helping to build new labour movement institutions organically rooted in working-class communities, and strengthening bonds with the trade union movement.Momentum has already launched a programme for recruiting and training leftwing Labour council candidates, and this should be developed further. Outside a handful of areas, such as Preston and Salford, the Labour left made only modest inroads in local government during the Corbyn years. Yet some Labour councils are increasingly unpopular, partly (though not entirely) as a result of being spitefully starved of funding by Tory governments. There is therefore a clear need for new ideas and a new fighting spirit on Labour-run councils. But Keir Starmer has been keen to build a base among existing Labour councillors, who will look to him for protection against any leftwingers trying to replace them.Perhaps Momentum’s paramount responsibility in the years ahead is to provide a constructive outlet for whatever socialist ideas and energies can be recuperated in the aftermath of Corbynism. For those on the Labour left who remain in the party, it needs to provide a bolthole, keeping members involved and engaged with local political activity, inside the party and out. There will be no shortage of things for socialists to do in the coming period with mass unemployment and a wave of evictions looming, many people will soon need the assistance of renters’ unions, food banks and mutual aid groups, for instance.Yet keeping these activists engaged with Labour will be a tough task. Starmer would lose little sleep over leftists cancelling their direct debits or cutting up their membership cards. Those socialists who continue to organise in and through the Labour party should be under no illusions about what’s ahead for them: a painstaking period of rebuilding, reorganising and rethinking. Others advocate forming a new leftwing party, but the circumstances for doing so could hardly be any less propitious, and without electoral reform (plus the support of the major left-led trade unions) such an endeavour would almost certainly be doomed.There are those, from the liberal centre to the reactionary right, who are hoping that the defeat of Corbynism has put socialism back in its box. But the Covid-19 crisis has vindicated the left in important respects. Forty-plus years of neoliberal neglect, and particularly the last, lamentable decade of vandalism to public services, left Britain ill-equipped (literally and figuratively) for the pandemic. This is a point implicitly conceded – at least in part – by the incumbent Tory government, which has been forced to take unprecedented, previously unthinkable measures simply to avoid full-blown economic collapse, driving a coach and horses through free-market theory in the process.Confronting us are multiple, intersecting crises to which self-proclaimed “moderates” can offer only sticking plasters and platitudes in response. The necessity of far-reaching social transformation remains as great as ever. While cohering a fractured Labour left will be an immense burden for Momentum to shoulder, this doesn’t have to guarantee failure. But this, in all likelihood, is its last chance to live up to its early promise.• Tom Blackburn is a founding editor of New Socialist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8699742085d25eb86186dc6dc2e6367cb1f50c/0_4_5766_3460/master/5766.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55b1c7a8333cf265e3c1b3605a6144d2","title":"louvre in paris reopens after 16 weeks in coronavirus lockdown museum","story":"The Louvre in Paris has reopened after shutting its doors for 16 weeks during the coronavirus crisis, but much of the world’s most visited museum remains closed and, with many non-EU visitors still banned, it is not expecting big crowds.Markers have been placed on the floor to make sure the 500 visitors who are admitted each half hour stand at least a metre apart while viewing the museum’s most popular works. There are also arrows to try to ensure visitors circulate smoothly round the former royal palace, with no doubling back allowed.“I am very, very happy to welcome visitors back,” the museum’s director, Jean-Luc Martinez, said to a round of applause from staff as the Louvre was declared open again on Monday morning. “A museum is made above all to welcome visitors.

He added that the museum, which had not been closed for such a long period since the second world war, would aim to make up for the loss by attracting more French visitors.Among the trickle of tourists on Monday was Zino Vandenbeaghen, who had travelled from Belgium to enjoy the unusual amount of space at both the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles. “It’s super,” he told the Associated Press. “The ideal moment to visit.”Although about 30,000 works remain accessible, two major temporary exhibitions, Body and Soul: Sculpture in Italy from Donatello to Michealangelo and Albrecht Altdorfer: a German Renaissance Master have been postponed until October.Paris tour guides wearing masks and holding Mona Lisa portraits protested outside the museum as it reopened, demanding more support from the government to help them ride out the coronavirus crisis and absence of tourists.France has announced measures worth €18bn to support its tourism sector but one protester, Margot Schmitz, said the money was not reaching independent tour guides on short-term contracts such as her. “The government is turning a deaf ear,” she told Reuters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/002ebca5a8d76126e7770794fd1ac28bf0538b9f/196_292_5734_3441/master/5734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82ae3c81fdc62561d42289966df40be8","title":"from dusted off bikes to electric dreams uk green economy booms on back of covid 19","story":"Pandemic accelerates developments in sustainability from businesses and consumersThe queues were “absolutely crazy”, says Gavin Hudson, the owner of the cycle repair startup Butternut Bikes. As lockdown descended he began fixing old bikes in the parking lot of a Methodist church in north London, before moving his services to a furloughed pub in Crouch End. However, the surge in demand for cycle repairs meant the pop-up was soon able to afford a permanent address.“Some people come in and tell us they haven’t been on a bike in 10 years,” Hudson says. “They are dragging all kinds of bikes, covered in cobwebs, out from the shed to get back on the roads. It’s great. I think it’s really true that there are few problems in society today that can’t be made better by getting people walking and cycling more.”Butternut Bikes is one of countless British businesses poised to profit from a green economic boom in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. While the government faces growing pressure to unveil a post-pandemic economic stimulus package that is climate friendly, Britain’s economic green shoots are already in evidence. Steven Jennings, a partner at the global advisory firm PwC, says the lockdown has triggered a paradigm shift for consumers and companies that is already accelerating developments in sustainability – even without prompts from the government.“One of the unintended consequences of the coronavirus crisis is the opportunity for businesses to think about the future. If a company has to rebuild itself, it makes sense to reconfigure how it works to be more sustainable,” Jennings says.The challenge for the Treasury is to design a stimulus package that seizes the opportunities emerging from the coronavirus crisis, which can tackle large-scale climate challenges, too.PwC includes low-carbon transport in its five-pillar plan to “build back better”, alongside major stimulus plans to accelerate low-carbon electricity generation, cut emissions from heavy industry and help build a green workforce with the skills to carry out the plans.Those without a banged-up bike in the shed will struggle to buy a new one because of the huge demand and a supply-chain hangover from China’s manufacturing lockdown at the start of the year. For many, the answer may be shared-cycle schemes, electric scooter rentals or even the purchase of an electric vehicle.Lime is one of the e-mobility firms booming in lockdown. The company expects to have attracted 20,000 new riders to its shared electric bike rental scheme by the time lockdown lifts and plans to offer e-scooters in the UK soon, too.Alan Clarke, a director of the firm, says the number of new Lime users has grown every week since lockdown restrictions started to be eased and that riders are taking longer journeys than before. The growth comes despite a surge in competition from rivals at Mobike, Freebike and Uber’s cycle offering, Jump.“Ultimately, the biggest reason people don’t cycle, walk or e-scoot is because most of the time, city infrastructure doesn’t prioritise these modes of transport,” Clarke says. “As governments are now being forced to rethink how they approach urban travel, and organisations like TfL deliver bold and transformative improvements, we do anticipate an influx of new riders over the next few months, as people search out alternative travel options.”The number of people considering the purchase of an electric vehicle is rising, too in part because the connection between Covid-19 deaths and air pollution has underlined the importance of clean transport. PwC estimates that government incentives could help the sector support 220,000 jobs.Ian Johnston, the chief executive of the vehicle-charging firm Engenie, says there has been a huge uplift in the number of retail parks preparing to install charging points. The company fits rapid chargers on behalf of retail landlords and councils at no upfront cost, in exchange for a share of the charge-point revenues.“Landlords are looking for new streams of revenues and retail tenants need new ways to drive footfall back to their stores,” he says. “The economic pressure on both means people are taking another look at vehicle charging.”A boom in electric transport holds important implications for Britain’s energy system, offering new opportunities for green tech companies. The demand slump during the lockdown combined with record renewable energy generation has helped to provide “a window into the future net zero carbon world”, according to Jennings.“We have had high penetration of renewable energy and negative wholesales prices at certain times of the day,” he says. “With the right government policies and regulation, more new business models will emerge, which could prove a tipping point for the likes of electric vehicle charging, batteries and time-of-use energy tariffs.”Battery operators can help balance the system by charging up when there is more than enough renewable energy on the grid and discharging the clean electricity when it is needed. Electric vehicles can play the same role when plugged into a smart charger.Steven Meersman, the founder of the battery operator Zenobe, says the firm has been working flat out during the lockdown to manage the “increased uptick in demand for our services”.Even energy supply deals that offer to pay homes and companies to use more energy when there is an abundance of wind and solar power can play a role in helping to make better use of a renewable energy boom.“This is a wake-up call for policymakers and regulators that making the small changes needed to enable a smart energy grid will be essential to the green recovery so many of us are calling for,” Jackson says. “This can be done today and will unlock a revolution in cheap, clean, electric heating, electric vehicles and a decentralised electricity system.”The fifth pillar of PwC’s plan for a green economic recovery is also in the home. Jennings believes a nationwide upgrade of drafty homes will help amplify the benefits of Britain’s electric future, boost jobs and offer a £3.20 benefit to the UK’s GDP for every £1 invested.It is a zero-risk approach to lowering carbon emissions and household bills, while raising the quality of life and health standards, which is rumoured to have left the prime minister Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, cold. However, he may have misjudged the public mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8caf7e1d144363e85f6e9b33cef160d5d0880fda/0_572_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4365c66ac7b2d5c0bd6d330e6c39aee8","title":"locks off london barbers reopen after lockdown photo essay","story":"Photographer  Christian Sinibaldi went to five salons and met some of their first clients in need of a trimAfter three months in lockdown, and many a home haircut, hairdressers were allowed to open from Saturday.

Normally I spend weeks standing on the shoreline of the hottest season, reluctant to change my clothes, habits or the arrangement of things. And then, when I do, I am the person shuffling in, a bare toe here or shaved leg there, wiping six months of dust from the outside chairs and pulling the thermal bag from under the bed, looking at a dress. It is usually early July by the time I locate my sunglasses, or simply give up looking and buy another pair.But this year, encouraged by my friend Alice and her suggestion of socially distanced time at the sea just north of Rome, I flung myself into the hottest season. We were like pale limbs just out of plaster, or animals blinking on their exit from a dark hibernation cave. After months contained in small spaces in a sleeping city, there was no time to hover over anything – clothes, inhibition, the shoreline – we were in, submerged in the inky cool of the Tyrrhenian sea, flapping and flailing like liberated animals, our skin on cold fire. Cold currents dance and tug in the stretch of coast between Santa Severa and Santa Marinella, and on good days a land breeze blows the water clear enough to see the pebbles wink and sea urchins spike from the seabed. Out of the sea we lay ourselves out on the hot pebbles to dry, bubbles of families under umbrellas dotted the beach doing much the same thing, the unselfconscious ease of a free pebble beach even more apparent after quarantena.We fling ourselves into summer eating, too. Full commitment to ice-creams from cold freezer chests, and watermelon, tomatoes with plaits of mozzarella, vegetables criss-crossed with char lines, oily fish or breadcrumbed chicken pressed between white rolls, and rice and pasta salads, about which I have no time for disdain. Having said that, I will happily debate or hear a strong opinion about a rice or pasta salad, especially if the recipe and story has a childhood or relative dragged into it, even more so if the story isn’t a saccharine one. The same with bean salad: I want to know what sort of beans your uncle used, if your grandma used her own extra-virgin olive oil or a squeeze of mayonnaise from a tube, how your neighbour nearly choked to death on a green bean.It is an unspoken rule of summer eating that it takes longer for people to gather and get to the table. Someone is in the shower, someone else has gone to buy a bag of ice because someone else forgot to refill the ice trays in the freezer and no one is doing anything before a gin and tonic. Fortunately, much summer food knows this, and will not only wait in some cases, it improves. The chickpea, aubergine and couscous dish from two weeks ago, or the potato and roast pepper insalata palermitana from last year and this bean salad are all good examples of dishes that benefit from sitting 30 minutes, for two hours (although maybe not in full glare) while the ice is put in glasses.300g green beans300g cooked cannellini beans300g cooked borlotti beans2 ripe tomatoes1 small red onionA small bunch of parsleyA handful of basil leavesA sprig of mintOlive oilRed wine vinegarSaltTail the beans and cook in plenty of well-salted boiling water until tender (timing will depend on size and age).

They had lost a chance to become champions of Italy on the only previous occasion that football was suspended mid-season – back in 1915. When the country went into lockdown this March, there were fears of history repeating.Lazio were one point behind Juventus at the top of Serie A, and unbeaten in 21 games. They had scored more goals than the champions and conceded fewer. When the two teams met for a pair of head-to-head showdowns in December – first in the league, then the Supercoppa – Lazio prevailed both times by an identical margin of 3-1.No other club in Serie A was more anxious to see this season completed. Before the league resumed last month, players agreed to take pay cuts – reflecting the club’s lost revenue as a result of the pandemic – that would be offset by a substantial bonus if they went on to win the title.“This team is absolutely worthy of a scudetto,” said the centre-back Francesco Acerbi. “In moments of difficulty we have never let ourselves become disunited. If the season resumes, I believe that mentality will endure to the end.”It takes more than the right mindset, though, to win football games. Four matches into the restart, Lazio’s title dreams are already in tatters. It is their legs, not their heads, that have failed them.They lost their first game back, away to Atalanta, despite racing into a 2-0 lead by the 11th minute. There is no shame in dropping points to one of the best attacking teams in Europe, but Lazio’s players looked out on their feet in the second half. With two games to play every week until the 2 August, they will have little chance to regroup.Lazio showed character as they came from behind to beat Fiorentina and Torino, but the contrast between their performances and those of Juventus – piling up 13 goals in a fortnight – was vivid. While the Bianconeri were moving ahead at full sail, the Biancocelesti were busy plugging leaks.Their squad had already been stretched thin by injuries, before Ciro Immobile and Felipe Caicedo picked up yellow-card suspensions during their win in Turin. Lazio would have to face a resurgent Milan on Saturday without their two most prolific strikers, responsible for 37 goals between them.The manager Simone Inzaghi did what he could, moving Luis Alberto up to partner Joaquín Correa in attack, but that left a gap in midfield. Lucas Leiva, who had not even made an appearance off the bench since a knee operation in April, was thrust back into the starting XI. Unsurprisingly, like so much of this team, he looked a long way from his best.It was Lucas who let Hakan Calhanoglu bypass him too easily in the 23rd minute, before the Milan player let fly with a shot that deflected off Marco Parolo’s boot and into Lazio’s net. For the third game in a row, Lazio had conceded the opening goal. This time they could not recover.Zlatan Ibrahimovic beat Thomas Strakosha again in the 31st minute, but this strike was disallowed for offside. No matter. From their next attack, the Rossoneri earned a penalty, Alexis Saelemaekers’s cross striking the arm of Stefan Radu. Strakosha got a hand to Ibrahimovic’s shot, but could not stop it from squirming across the line.Lazio kept taking on water. Saelemaekers, supported by Andrea Conti, tormented Radu on Milan’s right. After Ibrahimovic had occupied and bullied Lazio’s defenders in the first half, Ante Rebic replaced him in the second, offering speed and directness to exploit the gaps in a Lazio side that had no choice but to throw men forward. The Croat made it 3-0 just before the hour mark.That scoreline was a testament to how much Milan have improved lately under Stefano Pioli. But it was also a stark reminder of how the pandemic has impacted outcomes on the pitch.Before the coronavirus interruption, Lazio were unbeaten at the Stadio Olimpico, with 11 wins and three draws. They had the tightest defence in Serie A, and had aplus-37 goal difference. There were plenty of ways you could imagine them blowing their shot at the title, but a thrashing like this at home to Milan (whose own goal difference had not strayed above zero since September) was not high on the list.Of course, anything can happen in a one-off game. Inzaghi is fond of reminding reporters that “in football, you can go from the stars to the stalls in no time at all”. But there is no denying that the trajectories of these two teams have shifted drastically from where they were.It was always going to be more difficult for them to win the title under the present conditions. Their squad has always been thinner than Juventus’s. Lazio’s great advantage, in the spring, would have been the opportunity to concentrate all their energies on the league, enjoying extra days of rest between games while the Bianconeri juggled Serie A with the Coppa Italia and Champions League.Inzaghi refused to abandon hope on Saturday, insisting that his team would push on to the end, even if he would be picking his starting XI for the next game “together with the team doctor”. Lazio trail Juventus now by seven points, but there are still eight matches to go, and Juventus’s next two – at Milan and then home to Atalanta – will be far sterner tests than they have faced in the league since the restart.For Lazio’s fans, though, the dream is fading. To be replaced, once again, with frustration, at the thought of what might have been.• An improbable way for Lazio’s title dream to be dashed, but a perfectly predictable path for Internazionale. From 1-0 up, with a man advantage and a penalty to take in the 61st minute against Bologna, they contrived to lose 2-1. The 18-year-old Musa Juwara made a thrilling impact off the bench for Bologna, scoring the equaliser, but his performance does not excuse another implosion. Lautaro was anonymous even before missing the penalty and Roberto Gagliardini fluffed the follow-up. But this was another collective collapse, of the sort that was never supposed to happen on Antonio Conte’s watch.• Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a free-kick for Juventus, at the 43rd attempt. In so doing, he became the first Juventus player to reach 25 goals in Serie A since Omar Sivori in 1960-61.• Atalanta are the only team besides Juventus to have won every game in Serie A since the restart – though this was the toughest one yet, away to Cagliari. Giovanni Simeone had a beautiful opener disallowed for a very modern handball decision, before Luis Muriel’s penalty took the points. Atalanta are almost certainly too far back to fight for the title.• Welcome back Nicolò Zaniolo, who came off the bench for Roma to play his first game since rupturing a cruciate ligament in January. His appearance in Naples was a welcome sight, but overshadowed in the end by a brilliant winning goal from Lorenzo Insigne. His only previous Serie A goal at the Stadio San Paolo this season was a winner against Juventus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f08e18a83130bf34841f03caa97f261263afda6/0_73_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e0d210941d01f5eb6b790fb763adcb","title":"sergio ramos real madrid la liga","story":"An erratic side have been flawless since the league turned into a mini-knockout contest. Now the writing seems on the wallCasemiro couldn’t look but pretty much everyone else could see. Crouched right on the centre spot, the Real Madrid midfielder turned his back and brought his hands to his face. To the left, Éder Militão stood by him, gently laying a hand on his shoulder. Fifty metres away Athletic’s Iker Muniain was pacing, blood boiling. “Explain it, then,” he was demanding. “Always the effing same. Not even you lot can understand it.” And to the left of him Sergio Ramos was waiting to take a penalty, blood running cold. He was 12 yards from goal or “11 metres closer to the title” as Marca put it, which was easy to say afterwards.Easy to say at the time too, at least for some. There were 17 minutes remaining, a little over four games left at the end of the longest season, and it was 0-0 at the ground they call the Cathedral – the last great obstacle between Madrid and the league. There was a lot at stake but if Casemiro was nervous, he needn’t have been. There was silence, the place not the same when the only spectator is the bust of Pichichi. And Ramos had been here before: only Paco Gento had won more times at San Mamés, and not for long, while these moments and this spot had become his.Inked on Ramos’s ribs is the phrase “I am the master of my own destiny”. He was master of theirs too, and who better? Asked on Sunday what he thinks about when he’s waiting to take a penalty, he replied: “Just the three points.” He added: “Those moments of most uncertainty are when I feel most comfortable I’m the right person for it, delighted to do it.” If the first part wasn’t entirely true, the second definitely was. When he sent a penalty miles over the bar against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-final in 2012, denying Madrid a place in the final back when the obsession over their 10th European Cup asphyxiated them, Ramos told his brother Rene that next time he would show them next time he would dink it in, that would shut them up. So he did – in the semi-final of the Euros, two months later. I must say, captain, I’ve got to admire your balls.Perhaps later. He has taken a lot of penalties since and a lot have been Panenkas. Since Cristiano Ronaldo left, he has taken almost all of them. At first that might have felt a little indulgent, but no more. Ramos said dinking it is “logical” looked at coldly and him taking penalties just seems intelligent now, an act of efficiency. Last Thursday, he scored the 79th-minute spot kick that defeated Getafe 1-0, his 19th in a row – plus two more in shoot-outs – going back more than two years. He had scored against Croatia, Norway, Sweden and Romania Sevilla, Galatasaray, Eibar, Real Sociedad, Valladolid and Getafe, twice against Atlético, Celta and Girona, three times against Leganés. Now he had another against Athletic.As the ball went in Ramos ran off, pulling at the Madrid badge and shouting. Most of his teammates ran towards him but Casemiro didn’t. Hearing the ball hit the net, he slipped to his knees, alone, covered his face and prayed.He knew what this meant. Madrid were about to go seven points clear and although Barcelona would reduce that to four with a 4-1 win at Villarreal, Quique Setién admitted: “This was a performance we needed before.” Now what they need is a miracle. “In the bag”, ran AS’s headline. For once, it didn’t seem particularly premature. Madrid have four games left – Alavés (h), Granada (a), Villarreal (h), Leganés (a) – and a four-point lead, plus head-to-head advantage. They can afford to drop points twice. They’ve dropped none since lockdown, when Ramos learnt to play the piano and grew a beard you could hide a hamster in. They have won seven games in a row – and that, Zinedine Zidane said, “is no small thing.”This would be only Madrid’s third title in 12 years. In that time, they have won four European Cups. And here’s a tempting theory, tentatively offered: when the league became a Champions League, they went and won it when the season turned into a new tournament, self-contained and (re)starting in the summer: shorter, compact, and packed into a few short weeks, the reward is right there. Eleven “finals” Ramos called them, and while that’s usually an empty cliche, this time it felt meaningful. More their thing. The schedule relentless, no time to think. Just win. Just. Get. Through. They had to be close enough, of course. In previous years, the league had already ended by March. This season, Madrid had lost just three times before lockdown and had gone unbeaten between October and February. There is a reason they have a better head-to-head record. A clásico win and draw secured pre-pandemic symbolised a shift – even if, beaten by Betis just before everything stopped, they also needed Barcelona to slip up. Once would do three times plus a boardroom a crisis was a bonus.And yet there’s something about the restart that recalls the Champions League where Madrid have been so dominant, offering something immediate and tangible to cling on to, the finish line within sight, no margin for error. As if they like life on the edge – Russian roulette focussing the mind, making them who they are.Madrid have won all seven games since the return. It hasn’t always been sparkling – although they were excellent in the second half against Valencia – and on Sunday night the focus was on the referees again, Barcelona’s president Josep Maria Bartomeu finding a place to hide in complaints that VAR decisions since the restart have not been “equal” and that “the same team is always benefitted.” Madrid went top with a win in San Sebastián where they were awarded a penalty when Vinícius went down, scored the winner after Karim Benzema controlled the ball with his shoulderarm and where Real Sociedad had an Adnan Januzaj goal ruled out for offside against Mikel Merino. Against Valencia, Rodrigo Moreno’s opening goal had been ruled out for another offside. And against Athletic on Sunday, Madrid were given a penalty when Dani García trod on and tripped Marcelo, while Athletic weren’t when Ramos accidentally trod on Raúl García. Iñaki Williams was not impressed. Nor was Munian. “We’re seeing what’s happening in recent weeks, which team the decisions are going in favour of,” he said.“I’m tired of it, it seems like we’re always talking about the same thing,” Zidane said. “It seems like we only win thanks to the referees Madrid deserve respect.” Ramos insisted: “We’re not going to win the league because of the referees: those who have made mistakes should be self-critical, look at their players.” He had a point.Madrid have won seven in a row, kept four consecutive clean sheets and not even trailed yet. There’s been a sense of mission and certainty, almost an inevitability, that recalls some of those European successes. There is a depth to the squad, a variety of talent no one can match, and there’s also solidity and a seriousness about them, an awareness that it only takes a moment and that moment will come. That when it does, they’ll take it. Whether that’s a flash of inspiration from Benzema, a run from VinÍcius, Toni Kroos side-footing in a 20-yard shot with ridiculous ease, or Casemiro, their most consistent player, suddenly appearing in the six-yard box. And then there’s Captain Clutch, in his element, which by extension is theirs too. Sergio Ramos embodies the Real Madrid mindset better than anyone, the man with the habit of appearing as the season reaches a climax, occasionally absent in the autumn but superb by the spring, driven by the destiny right before him. The man who prefers the pressure to be on. An almost cartoonish character, all red cards and redemption, with a feel for moments that matter, the stage that awaits. The finals, the photos, the Ramos Time: 92.48 and all that.All this, too. Not so dramatic, but not so different either. That run of penalties starts in May 2018 with an 89th-minute winner against Sevilla, his former club. Of the 20 spot kicks, 14 changed the result. The last three, in three weeks against Real Sociedad, Getafe and Athletic, changed the destination of a unique league, the longest title race ever and the shortest too. “The Covid league,” Ramos called it, as if it was a whole new competition, which it kind of feels like. It also feels like it will be his. Since the football returned, no one in Spain has scored more goals. When the latest penalty was given Casemiro couldn’t look, all too aware what this meant, but the man taking it was aware too, which is why everyone else knew. Put Sergio Ramos on the spot, and only one thing is going to happen.

After running upstairs to the roof of her house for a better signal, the 39-year-old farmer finally hears the first piece of good news to come her way in months: an order for 600 pineapples from a harvest that she had feared might have to be left to rot.Now technology has come to the rescue of some of those farmers, as befits a country that boasts a large population of tech-savvy entrepreneurs.“The local wholesalers were offering such low rates, and the produce was rotting. That was when I got a call from A-Bani suggesting I market my produce online,” says Marak.A-Bani is an app launched a few weeks ago by the nonprofit Anant Foundation to connect Meghalaya farmers with buyers interested in high-quality organic produce, such as turmeric, pineapple, jackfruit, and cashew.The app is just one of dozens of virtual markets that have opened up during the lockdown as quickly as the street markets shut down. Many of them were community farming initiatives that are now using the internet to connect farmers with consumers.Dhanunjaya KC discovered one of those when the lockdown sent him back from his engineering college in Bengaluru to his family’s two-hectare grape orchard in Gudahalli. A Google search for “How to sell agricultural produce online in India” led him to the Twitter account Harvesting Farmer Network (HFN).“Ruchit Garg, who runs it, posted my details on Twitter. My phone hasn’t stopped ringing since then,” says Dhanunjaya. He and his father rented a truck to go to Bengaluru and deliver boxes of grapes to 30 apartment complexes. They made Rs 25 per kg. The middlemen in Gudahalli were offering Rs 8-10 per kilo.HFN is a virtual network connecting farmers directly with customers across the country that Garg runs from his home in Chandigarh, north India. The founder of an agritech company, Garg stepped in when he saw pictures of farmers feeding their broccoli harvest to cows because there were no buyers. He has now launched a website to take HFN beyond Twitter.“In two months, we’ve sold 20,000 tonnes of produce – avocados from Nilgiris to papaya from Chattisgarh,” says Garg, whose team helps farmers with packaging and delivery.Up in Tons Valley, in the hill state of Uttarakhand, social entrepreneur Anand Sankar has made a success out of pre-ordering and pre-payment for the apple orchards that dot the landscape. Sankar ran a social media campaign to sell 250 boxes of apples to iniduals in Coimbatore, Delhi, Chennai and Bengaluru.Mango farmers along the Konkan coast in Maharashtra, devastated by the pause on exports, are now receiving a flood of orders from housing societies in Pune and Mumbai facilitated by startup Gaia Agritech.The idea of buying fresh produce directly from the grower, often at a competitive rate, appeals to city dwellers. Anamika Bist, who lives in a Bengaluru high rise and runs Village Story, a community farming enterprise, organised an online Lockdown Farmers’ Market, circulating farmers’ details across social media. Her WhatsApp has not stopped buzzing in the last two months.More than 1,400 miles away, in the Himalayan town of Pithoragarh, Hemendra Negi, a 31-year-old flower grower, chanced upon Bist’s social media campaign. Within days of contacting her, he had more than 400 enquiries, and an order of 30,000 flowers to deliver in May, at three times the rate of the local wholesale market.Negi pleaded with truck drivers transporting vegetables to carry his boxes of flowers to relatives in Delhi who then hand delivered them across the city.The new digital platforms are now gearing up for a longer shelf life. Leather exporter Sunil Gahtori, who has linked a network of 30 farmers with 200 housing societies around Bengaluru through the initiative Taru (Team for Agri Resource Utilisation) and is building an app for it, says it should encourage a deep think into healthy, organic living.The food policy analyst Devinder Sharma says macro level policies are needed to manage volume and sustain agriculture during the pandemic. “Just like people have a family doctor, they should have a family farmer, too,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9b371de890749ed7f8f55acd41428ac9f4a0af/0_207_3088_1852/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b3c8f46d957adf8bcb311636fd3bfc","title":"how we met when i first saw him i knew he was the man i would marry","story":"Steve and Susie Zaleski, 48 and 47, met on a ing course in Thailand in the summer of 2000. Almost a decade later, and with two children, they travelled the world. They now live in DevonSusie Wood had been living in Japan for 18 months when she went on holiday to Thailand in August 2000. “I was travelling with my cousin, who was keen to try a ing course in Koh Tao, so I thought I’d give it a go.” She caught Steve’s eye on the first day. He says: “I was on a sabbatical from my job at a London prop-making company, and I was working as a emaster. I was responsible for getting guests fitted with wetsuits. I definitely liked Susie as soon as I saw her.”She noticed his blond hair and tan. “We were out for three days on the open-water course,” says Susie. “In the end, I offered to make him a cup of tea as an excuse to speak to him.” They got chatting about their experiences of travelling and realised they had lots in common. “He has such a positive attitude to life. It was contagious.”As soon as she had completed the ing course, Susie signed up for the next level so she could spend more time with Steve. Before the course began, they went for dinner in the e school with the rest of class. “We had our first kiss at this tropical beach bar,” Steve says. After 10 days, Susie returned to her teaching job in Japan. “I suggested he come to visit on his way back to England,” she says. “It’s definitely not on the way,” laughs Steve. “But in September I thought, why not go?”Steve flew into Tokyo and travelled to Hirosaki to see Susie. “It was hard to get around Japan 20 years ago,” he says. “It involved so many trains and night buses.” After Steve returned to England, they stayed in touch and Susie invited him to stay with her family in Devon for Christmas. “I didn’t know him well, but it was a bit of a test to see how he’d get on with my family.”In 2001, Susie returned to Japan and they continued their long-distance relationship. “I would go to the office early so I could call her, and we sent each other handwritten letters,” says Steve. When Susie’s contract finished that May, the couple spent three months travelling around Asia. They moved to London after their trip, where Susie found work with a charity.At the end of the year, they purchased a flat in Stoke Newington in north London. “By 2005, I was feeling claustrophobic and suggested we think about putting the house on the market. It was up for sale the next day,” says Susie. They went to Brighton to view a house and put in an offer on the spot.Not long after the move, Susie fell pregnant. Their first daughter, Aiya, was born in the summer of 2006, and the couple married a year later. In 2008, they had a second daughter, Lola. It wasn’t long before Steve and Susie became restless, so the following year, they sold their home and embarked on a round-the-world trip before the children started school.“I think people thought we were a bit strange, but it was incredible,” she says. “We spent a few months in different places. Having a teething baby was a bit of a challenge while we were camping in New Zealand.” At the end of the trip, they returned to Devon and now live opposite Susie’s family. Steve set up a bespoke furniture and interior fittings company and Susie went back to teaching.“We’re both so silly together and we hardly ever argue,” says Steve. “We enjoy doing all the same things we did when we met – experiencing things and meeting people.” Susie loves her husband’s humour and his zest for life. “We have always had so much fun. Even when I first saw him, I think I knew he’d be the man I would marry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ea4901181f349c46918e1ec92a7e984276fafb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa7e16daf8a75b3e0c775b69680319d7","title":"more women like me are choosing to be childfree is this the age of opting out","story":"Ecological collapse is within sight – and yet parenting is still viewed as a moral imperative. But countless women like me are building a new normal: a life without children Imagine a world in which, one day, you learned you’d eventually be expected to give birth to, then raise, an ostrich. It would be a long-lived ostrich, one residing with you inside your home for at least eighteen years.\u0026nbspThis large, growing bird would require a great deal of care – daily, exhausting, heroic care, for which you wouldn’t be paid, nor, in general, well supported. In fact, you’d probably have to take time off from work if you’re a woman, your ability to earn a post-ostrich livelihood would most likely be curtailed, perhaps severely. Plus, there would be the expense of ostrich daycare, ostrich violin lessons in the future, god help you, ostrich college. Did you catch the part where you’re physically birthing the ostrich? It would tear open your body as it emerged from either between your legs or a gash sliced across your stomach, this larger-than-usual, speckled ostrich egg.Then, imagine that, despite the pervasive societal expectations, you realized one day that you could opt out of having an ostrich. You never wanted the bird in the first place. Imagine how much more natural it might feel if you could just not.I’m starting with illustrative ostriches because I’ve learned, over the years, that people tend not to believe me if I indicate that I don’t feel, and have never felt, the urge to have children. Indicate, because I rarely say it outright. If directly asked, I respond, “Oh, I don’t know, not yet,” as if there’s a question about it – as though I haven’t been certain, all my life, that I’m at least as disinclined to parent a child as I would an ostrich. I equivocate with the hope of heading off the arguing, the unsolicited assurances about what my body wants and how I should live my life: “You’ll change your mind,” I’m often told. “Hey, you never know.” Except I haven’t I do. Thus, ostriches.But how can this be so difficult to believe? My position should be, by now, plausible: the American fertility rate is at a historic 35-year low. The so-called “replacement rate” – the national birthrate believed to be optimal for population renewal and stability – is 2.1 babies per couple today people with wombs are expected to have 1.71 children in their lifetimes. And that 1.71 estimate came before the pandemic in this changed world, in which it seems all the parents of young children I know are having by far the hardest time of their parenting lives, it seems likely that fertility rates will keep falling.Looking around at the state of this country, as well as the world, it doesn’t seem particularly surprising that the birthrate would be declining. Parenting in the US is especially costly and difficult, for one. And then there’s the climate crisis: in a 2018 New York Times poll, a third of Americans of childbearing age cited climate change as a factor in their decision to have fewer children.\u0026nbspBased on my experiences, I’d say one-third sounds, if anything, low. I’m in my thirties a significant majority of my friends still don’t have children, and many say the climate is a serious consideration. Since the pandemic started, friends who’d been unsure if they wanted children have begun saying they’re leaning more decisively toward not. If I look at a still younger set of people, the college students and graduate students I’ve frequently encountered while teaching and publicly speaking, I’d say the one-third figure sounds lower still, and how could it not be? In the absence of massive systemic change, it seems possible that ecological collapse will happen within college students’ lifetimes, and they know it.Prospective parents also see the deficit in other, essential kinds of support, community, fellowship, help. In The Atlantic, Alia Wong argues that America’s low fertility rate is “a sign that the country isn’t providing the support Americans feel they need in order to have children”. Even without a life-upending pandemic, trying to have a baby without consistent, legally enforced societal and medical support is indeed very hard. Or, as Anna Louie Sussman posits in the New York Times: “It seems clear that what we have come to think of as ‘late capitalism’ – that is, not just the economic system, but all its attendant inequalities, indignities, opportunities and absurdities – has become hostile to reproduction.”\u0026nbspCould this falling birthrate eventually affect how childfree people are viewed in the US? (Childfree, I’ll emphasize, not childless – a lot of people without offspring prefer to reserve the term “childless” for those who are unable to have children.)With plenitude, comes acceptance, even normalcy, until the childfree seem unremarkable – something like that?\u0026nbspIt might be unlikely. Throughout history, people without children – women, especially – have often been persecuted, mistreated, pitied, and killed for their perceived lack. In ancient Rome, a woman who hadn’t borne children could legally be orced, and her infertility was grounds for letting a priest hit her with a piece of goat skin. (The blows were thought to help women bear children.) In Tang Dynasty China, not having a child was once again grounds for orce. In the Middle Ages, infertility was believed to be caused by witches or Satan worse yet, an infertile woman could be accused of being, herself, a witch. In Puritan America, it wasn’t just having no children that was suspect. Giving birth to too many children could be perilous, too, and grounds, yet again, for being condemned for a witch.\u0026nbspAlso in the US, enslaved women were expected to have babies, and were routinely raped, their potential future children considered a slaveholder’s property. Some of the only times women without offspring have garnered respect might be when they have formally devoted their lives to a god, and to celibacy: nuns, vestal virgins.Which brings us to a word I haven’t yet used, but which often is levied against childfree women like me: selfish. Despite everything, it’s still common to view parenting as a moral imperative, to such an extent that voluntarily childfree people can be viewed with such outsize emotions as anger and disgust. Pope Francis, a lifelong celibate, has said: “The choice not to have children is selfish. Life rejuvenates and acquires energy when it multiplies: it is enriched, not impoverished.” Such judgments might be even more available now, at a time when so much, especially including parenting, has become more difficult for so many people.I used to find this charge bewildering. How can it be selfish not to want? Why does it bother anyone if I refrain? The world is burning, and it’s been argued that the single best way an inidual in a developed country can reduce her carbon footprint is by having fewer children. (Of course, what can really reduce our carbon footprints is ending our planet-strangling reliance on fossil fuels.) What’s more, a hundred children from a less economically developed nation could easily have a smaller carbon footprint than one American child. To be very selfless, I could move to a less rich land and help raise an entire orphanage.\u0026nbspAnd the upset about the replacement birthrate – part of me is tempted to ask why it matters. Why is it prima facie an obvious good in and of itself that our species collectively keep overpopulating the earth? We abound, you and I. No other animals despoil this planet the way we do. But okay, if one wished to argue on behalf of the improved national social stability provided by having a younger population – well, in that case, let’s further open our borders. Let’s fling them open. As Adam Minter says in Bloomberg: “Until some country shows otherwise, immigration remains the most effective means of reversing a baby bust.”Voilà, an elegant, satisfying, available solution for birthrate concerns.\u0026nbspBack to the question of selfishness: I used to wonder, as I’ve mentioned, what could be selfish about wanting to live my own life, one in which I’m electing not to take care of this hypothetical, doesn’t-even-exist American child – or ostriches. And then, I realized. That’s it, right there, I think. I’m a woman as one, I’m expected to look after others. To nurture. To mother: a child, most often. Plus anyone else who could use my time, really. That’s the most uncontroversial kind of woman to be: one devoted to caretaking.Here is where, if I wanted to, I might include a detailed paragraph about the caretaking I already do. I could line up examples of how unselfish I can be, how passionately I care about family and friends, and how I give to my larger communities. I could talk about being an aunt I could explain how I’ve tried to help sustain friends with children, all to say: Look, I’m not the monster you might think I am. But I don’t want to prove any claims to unselfishness here – nor that of other childfree adults. It’s irrelevant, and I shouldn’t have to. It would be as if I abruptly started telling you how much I love Valeria Luiselli’s writing. “What does Valeria Luiselli’s writing have to do with wanting or not wanting children,” you might wonder, to which I’d say yes, exactly, do you see?Instead, I think of how, for as long as I can remember, I’ve softened my refusal to be a parent. The times I’ve said, “Not yet,” the parties at which I’ve smiled when a stranger informs me I’ll change my mind, as if he’s more familiar with my body than I am. The talk of ostriches. It occurs to me that this is yet another way I force myself to take up less space: I badly don’t want my private refusal to sound like an affront to anyone else’s desires.\u0026nbspBut one grows tired of extending courtesies that are too often not reciprocated, and maybe, for once, I’ll say it plain: I don’t want children, I never have, and it doesn’t feel like any kind of lack. To me, it just feels like being alive.Additional reporting by Adrienne Matei"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75cba745ffd5bedc04a495560255a1cf1348ab11/58_106_3315_1987/master/3315.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bad0022f2278d13baa73df301950874a","title":"sunflowers adopted cats mona lisa monday best photos","story":"’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world, including the Mona Lisa, fires in California and lotus flowers in China"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f7688891cc6b23367421bb1e2412a37a7fdeae/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5f9d8658366cb4e9f9b242928c3588","title":"britain beyond lockdown what we learned from two weeks on the road","story":"People do not want to go back to the way things were, but the good intentions could fade without the right leadershipBritain is crying out for a better normal. Communities across the country are emerging from lockdown with a new sense of what is possible and what is necessary – and the answers to both go a lot further than Westminster’s efforts to drive the country back to business as usual.That was the overriding impression from a two-week reporting trip around Britain, asking people in different regions how they view recovery and whether there is an appetite for more fundamental change.The answer, overwhelmingly, was that we cannot just go back to the way things were, that there are elements brought out by lockdown that should continue, and that more needs to be done to prepare the country for the economic, mental health and climate crises to come.During the two-week trip, the  reported on some of the communities worst affected by Covid-19, most vulnerable to economic shocks, and most interested in transition to a healthier, cleaner and fairer way of life. I visited Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Hartlepool, Aberdeen, Machynlleth, Fishguard and Bristol.Travelling by campervan, which doubled as a mobile office, hotel, restaurant and toilet, I interviewed more than 50 people, mostly in parks, hotels and shopping centres but also in a graveyard, and over phone and video calls.  also collaborated with YouGov-Cambridge Centre and Jesus College Intellectual Forum at Cambridge University to conduct a survey of more than 1,600 people.The journey revealed how quickly local communities had adapted to ease the worst impacts of lockdown and build on the benefits. Social centres, community-owned pubs, food banks, green groups and art cooperatives repurposed themselves within days to distribute food and medicine, set up online counselling and cooking classes, and provide emergency financial support – sometimes in the form of £50 in an envelope – for the many zero-hours contract workers who were suddenly unemployed but not immediately able to claim benefits.“The virus gave us permission to be kind again,” said Sacha Bedding, manager of the Annexe community centre in Hartlepool. “We should celebrate the way communities have responded. Millions did a good thing.”While communities have shown speed and strength, the national government has proved slow and inept. The UK has so badly botched its response that the country is now recording more weekly deaths than the 27 EU nations combined. Britain’s economy has suffered more than that of any country in the G7.Harder to calculate is the emotional wellbeing of the nation, but the survey found higher levels of stress and many interviewees expressed concern about a looming wave of mental health problems.In an analysis of possible post-Covid-19 scenarios drawn up by the Long Crisis Network, the most compelling is a weakening of national and city institutions as they struggle to cope with a wave of crises that resemble “the latter, more frenetic stages of Tetris”. Alternatively, it predicts that these national and municipal institutions will act as a platform for ideas that emerge from communities and online.“Life becomes more local. The virtual is the new norm as physical travel seems daunting,” envisages the study. “Covid mutual aid networks evolve into essential assets in most places, balancing flexibility and informality, even providing hardship funds and peer-to-peer loans.” In many places, this is already happening.The reporting trip revealed how low-income Hartlepool has been less affected economically than affluent, globalised Aberdeen, where the collapse of oil prices prompted North Sea drilling companies to sack rig workers and engineers.In Hartlepool, a third of families were workless even before the pandemic struck. This meant the town had less to lose and its community support networks were already hardened by previous crises. “Instead of levelling up, we could see a levelling down,” Bedding warned. “Hartlepool could be the future for other towns.” Avoiding that means anticipating the next crisis rather than reacting only to the last.After the financial crisis of 2008, the government put the onus for recovery on iniduals by slashing public spending and encouraging UK consumers to splurge. That is less of an option now. Many people are still wary of entering shops and other public spaces. Despite the easing of the lockdown, most shopping centres were eerily empty. Angela Arnold, a coffee shop owner, said mindsets had shifted during lockdown. “I think it has changed people’s perceptions of shopping. We don’t just buy what we want. We feel like we have to justify it is what we need.” But these good intentions could fade quickly without a strong sign from the government that the UK will not drift back to environmentally destructive economic habits. For all the prime minister’s talk of a “fairer, greener recovery”, he seems more interested in pouring concrete, laying tarmac and encouraging consumption.During the trip, mayors and academics said more could be gained if the state opened its wallet with investments to modernise the economy, create jobs and cut emissions.Car manufacturers need a jumpstart to switch production to electric vehicles, or they will be left behind by foreign competitors. In the north-east, plans for Europe’s biggest carbon capture and storage plant will give work to thousands and help cut emissions. In Aberdeen, wind turbine makers and hydrogen gas developers are creating jobs while oil companies are shedding workers.Across the country, the biggest employment boost could come from converting home heating systems. Although this may be less politically attractive to the prime minister than building “Boris hospitals”, it will do more to end fuel poverty and create jobs. The nation needs to convert 2,000 home gas boilers every day until 2050 to reach its legally binding net-zero carbon goal.There are also huge gains to be had from greater self-sufficiency and ersity in energy and food. At a community level, this is already happening. In Wales, the “land army” of volunteer workers are sharing their first harvest among the needy, promoting a “buy local” movement, and encouraging sheep farmers to devote more of their land to fruit and vegetables to reduce the risks of shortages and price spikes from imports. In Bristol, the working-class community of Lawrence Weston has opened a lockdown support centre and plans to build its own wind turbine, which would give it a revenue stream for the next 30 years.Such strategic planning is essential. Community leaders know the health crisis is certain to be followed by a tsunami of unemployment, bankruptcies and mental health problems, and the ever more catastrophic effects of climate breakdown. As a result, resilience has gone from being a trendy buzzword for policy wonks to a priority for survival. During the lockdown, communities have shown themselves to be nimble and creative in these regards.This could be a building block for the future. Lucy Stone, a Dorset-based social entrepreneur who set up a community energy project in her village, believes collective local initiatives are creating a culture of “commoning” – sharing ownership, risks, benefits and decision-making. “You literally give people a stake. You don’t just consult them,” she observed. “This approach could accelerate action on climate and address the inequalities embedded in our current fossil fuel systems.”That is a far cry from Boris Johnson’s “build, build, build” attempt to return to business as usual. But it could bring people together, focus more on wellbeing than profit, and make the country more resilient to future shocks. It would also represent change on the scale the public desires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"If you work in a sector at risk of collapse and have lost your job due to coronavirus, we would like to hear from youThinktank Resolution Foundation has said that the biggest job creation package in peacetime is needed to prevent the worst unemployment crisis in Britain for a generation.Some of the hardest-hit sectors include the aviation industry, hospitality, non-food retail, leisure and entertainment.If you work in one of these industries and have become unemployed due to coronavirus, we would like to hear from you.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

But evidence is emerging of a significant minority – sometimes referred to as “long haulers” – who struggle with long-term symptoms for a month or longer.Anecdotal reports have abounded of people left with fatigue, aching muscles and difficulty concentrating. Online support groups on Facebook and Slack have sprung up, already hosting thousands of members who say they have not got better.Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Matt Hancock said it was difficult to gauge the scale of the problem. “This is a really serious problem for a minority of people who have Covid,” the health secretary said. “Some people have long-term effects that look like a post-viral fatigue syndrome.”Scientists are only just beginning to investigate the potential causes of enduring fatigue, but say that there are likely to be a wide variety of reasons why some people face a longer road to recovery.“Fatigue itself will take on lots of different guises,” said Chris Brightling, a professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester, who is leading a newly announced £8.4m study of the long-term health impacts of Covid-19.A report published in February by the World Health Organization, based on preliminary data, suggested that in mild cases the median recovery time from Covid-19 is roughly two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and in severe or critical cases about three to six weeks. However, some of those who appear to have only mild illness initially also end up wrestling with symptoms, including fatigue, that linger for weeks or months.Those who have suffered severe illness in the acute phase, including admission to intensive care, typically experience muscle loss, which can result in direct physical fatigue. Others are left with lung damage, including scarring that can cause breathlessness, leaving people feeling tired. There are other physical effects that are less clearly understood – the disease is known to cause blood clots in the lungs and other parts of the body – and neurological symptoms ranging from stroke to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.“How common each of those things are, we simply don’t have good information,” said Brightling.There is previous evidence linking Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) to infectious outbreaks, including Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever. A study of people infected during the 2003 Sars outbreak revealed that almost a third had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function.Brightling’s study will track around 10,000 patients who were admitted to hospital with Covid-19. This will allow scientists to assess what proportion of patients end up with which long-term health impacts, and what the risk factors are for different symptoms. This could help pave the way to better treatments and medical support for those who are left struggling months after initially becoming ill.Figuring out how Covid-19 triggers fatigue symptoms could also offer new insights into some of the ways that chronic fatigue can occur more generally. “One of the big challenges is that there’s so much that we don’t yet understand,” said Brightling. “People who specialise in fatigue are seeing people with multiple reasons why they’ve ended up at that point.”In this case, he said, because the trigger for fatigue is known, there is a better chance of understanding what is happening in the body. “It gives you a way of trying to unravel that puzzle,” said Brightling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1735f96a21dd73afbb73ce3f79e1f566856bdedf/0_65_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4b5bc61b7cef801738656eea3a5e5491","title":"mose masoe rugby league hull kr spinal injury legs","story":"The Hull KR prop suffered a serious spinal injury in January but straight after the operation he vowed to recover. On 13 May he took his first, unaided steps“Patience,” Mose Masoe eventually says as he looks at his little garden outside Hull and finds the right word to describe the most valuable lesson he has learned while overcoming paralysis. Masoe is a giant of a man but his stature has nothing to do with his size as a 6ft 3in former rugby league prop who weighed 20st at his peak. His monumental character allows him to reflect on all he has gained, and lost, with clarity rather than self-pity.Plastic toys are spread around the garden and, after two hours, I don’t see any sadness in the Samoa international. He was a force for Hull Kingston Rovers as co-captain of the Super League club until, on 12 January, he suffered a catastrophic injury in a pre-season game against Wakefield that left him paralysed from the shoulders down. The 31-year-old New Zealander is soon rocking with amusement when his Australian wife, Carrisa, says: “Mose was pretty patient before but not being able to scratch your nose when you’re lying on your back for six weeks takes it to another level.”The frustrating memories make Masoe smile wryly. “Patience and belief is what you need most,” he says. “There are tough days but you’ve always got to look forward to the better times.”A baby, the couples’ third, and a fourth child and second son for Masoe, is due to be born at home next week. Excitement and hope fizz around them and make an otherwise devastating story so uplifting. It can also be sobering and there are times when Carissa looks down thoughtfully. She knows their battle is far from over.Masoe remembers the only time he and his wife cried together. “When you can’t feel your legs, you think: ‘Ohhhhh, this is not good,” he says. “They took me off the pitch and put needles in my leg and I couldn’t feel it. That’s when it sank in. They were assessing me in the changing rooms before the ambulance came. I said to Carissa: ‘Can you pinch me?’ She was pinching my thigh and I couldn’t feel anything. We had a little cry together. But, after that, it’s been sweet.”When their tears fell, splashing together on the concrete floor, did Masoe think he might never walk again? “Yeah,” he murmurs.“I felt awesome. This year the coaching staff said: ‘Dude, get yourself in shape.’ Every pre-season before I was trying to get skinnier. Normally, they want me to get down to 120kg but this time I was allowed to get up to 130kg. For the first time the coaches said: ‘You know what your body needs.’ I could do weights at last and in the gym I was doing 300kg deadlifts.”The Wakefield friendly was the first game of the season and after two minutes Masoe missed a tackle “and went over the top. My neck went into a hyper-extension and one ligament snapped in the front and when I landed another snapped at the back. The bones in my neck came together and that bruised swelling pinched my cords and stopped most of the signals from my brain. There was no pain. But, when I opened my eyes, I couldn’t feel my legs. My arm was spasming and I realised I’d done something really bad.”Carissa had just bought hot dogs for their two young daughters at the game. “They were worrying about the food,” she says, “and I was sorting them out when I felt these eyes looking at me. I looked around and No 10 wasn’t there. Usually, when Mose went down he’d get straight up. But you could tell, just by the way he was lying, he was in trouble.”At the hospital in Leeds, Masoe says: “A random doctor did the scans. He wasn’t a spinal specialist so he said: ‘They look fine.’” Carrisa says: “I heaved the biggest sigh of relief. But Mose didn’t believe it.”Masoe shakes his head. “I knew it was serious. Fifteen minutes later, the specialist gave us the worst-case scenario. I needed emergency surgery. He even pushed me to the operating room because no porters were available. He looked quite young. The nurse was bossing him around because she thought he was the porter. He goes: ‘Sorry, mate, I’m the surgeon. I need you to do what I tell you.’ I was cracking up. But I had confidence in him because he’d told me straight: ‘Mate, it doesn’t look good. I need to get in there and release the pressure.’”The combination of a skilled surgeon and a gritty rugby league player produced an incredible outcome. “I came to around 3am,” Masoe says. “At the far side of intensive care they pulled a sheet over someone that had passed away. It was a young girl who got stabbed in the neck. I thought: ‘This poor person’s passed away. I can’t feel sorry for myself.’ Then my wrist moved a flicker. I said: ‘You’ve got a chance here. Make the most of it.’”Steve Ball, the general manager of the Rugby League Benevolent Fund, arrived the next morning. He sits with us now and says: “I held Mose’s hand and told him: ‘You and I are going to become great friends.’” The Fund has bolstered the family financially and emotionally. Ball helped extend Masoe’s rehab at the world-renowned Pindersfields spinal unit in Wakefield, just when it seemed the Covid crisis might force him out of hospital. Masoe believes the decision to allow him to remain at the unit until 24 April saved his rehabilitation. “Dean, one of their physios, was a massive help and all the staff were incredible.”So much depended on Masoe’s attitude. Ball brought him a special pair of glasses, with a lens that meant he could see his toes when he was paralysed. “I lay there for hours trying to move my big toe. It took me 48 hours to get a flicker in my knee. I would concentrate on moving the big toe until I fell asleep. Wake up the next morning and do the same thing.”Carissa was pregnant and exhausted, looking after the girls, and worried sick about her husband – whom she could not see for seven weeks during lockdown. “I had a few cries to Steve on the phone,” she says.Ball brought an iPad for Masoe to communicate with his family and, before he returned home, costly purchases were made. “Steve put in a lift at home,” Masoe says. “Because we’ve got two sets of stairs he offered another one. I said: ‘Steve, save the money. I’ll crawl up there.’ Now I can walk up there with a crutch. It took me weeks but I wanted a challenge.”In mid-May, 16 weeks after he had been paralysed, Masoe took his first steps on his own. Carissa recorded the moment as, on impulse, Masoe thought: “Let’s give it a go. I was so nervous because I didn’t want to squash my little girl. The only thing between me and her was that frame. I was thinking: ‘Don’t fall over!’”Carissa says: “He’s had a couple of spills, which we know is normal. It frightens the girls but Mose’s so blase there’ve been a few times I’ve been cooking dinner and he’ll talk to me. I’ll turn around and he’s trying to walk himself. He had a fall last weekend.”Masoe smiles sheepishly. “I was walking in the dark because Carissa let me stay downstairs for the first time after she went to bed. I was watching some guy show. She heard this almighty bang and came rushing downstairs. I fell over in the kitchen – trying to reach the fridge to get some food.”He laughs before, with typical honesty, detailing some hidden challenges of his situation. “Carissa has to help me with my bowels in the morning. And then, because I can’t urinate, I take this pill. At night it doesn’t work. It’s difficult to do a wee. I feel sorry for Carissa. She has to empty them out in the morning. It’s the biggest battle. Bowels and bladders.”Carissa says: ‘Most people in hospital said they’d rather get them sorted than walk again. Walking’s maybe No 3 on the list.” Will these problems improve with time? “We don’t know.” Masoe admits. “It’s like everything with this injury. It’s unknown.”One of the few certainties is that Masoe will never playagain. His love of the game was evident when, while waiting for emergency surgery, he asked Carissa to Google the result of the friendly. “We lost,” he says. “I was gutted. But I didn’t mourn the end of my career. I only had a few more years left but you get to that point in your life where you just appreciate being part of a team. I was there.“But I’m happy where I am now. I’ve still got lots of rehab but I want to go into the mental side of rugby and help young kids. After all my battles hopefully I can pass on knowledge as a mentor or counsellor. It would be nice to give back that way.”Masoe lifts himself out of his chair. He stands up and says: “It feels good. Walking still takes a massive effort but I’m getting better.”There will be even more hope when the baby arrives. “That’s a big silver lining for us,” Carissa says. “We can’t think this is the worst year ever because we’re having a boy.” Masoe nods intently. “I won’t remember 2020 for the neck injury and a tough year. I will remember it for the birth of our son.”Slowly, patiently, Masoe walks around his garden. The sun steams down and a smile spreads across his face. “It’s an awesome day, isn’t it?” he says quietly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2bca8a736c9950f5cc63bd3d0e9b13b901a41c/56_0_3944_2366/master/3944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52f8cd553759a99ac15b64d7465efba","title":"the greatest novak djokovic speedy superserver who masters mind games","story":"Who has been the best male tennis player of the last 50 years? It could easily be the current World No 1In 2007, as Roger Federer wreaked havoc on the world, a young Serb with freakish flexibility and a wicked backhand began to put himself on the map. As he rose up the rankings, Novak Djokovic passed a series of players who lost to the best before they even stepped on to the court. People wondered aloud whether Djokovic was really any different.“Why should I be frightened?” Djokovic responded. “For me it’s a totally normal thing. If you go out on the court thinking positively and thinking: ‘I can win against anybody,’ I think that’s a right thinking. If you go with the white flag on the court, what are you doing there?”The story of Djokovic’s breakthrough will always begin with Federer and Rafael Nadal, and how the future seemed clear before his arrival. By the end of 2007, Federer had won eight of the previous 10 slams. Immediately after Djokovic’s first Australian Open in 2008, the Spaniard secured the French Open-Wimbledon double with one of the greatest matches of all time in the final of the latter. Djokovic was always tipped to compete for slam titles but the question was how consistently he could overcome two young legends of the sport.The answer took three long years as he dealt with physical afflictions and questions about his integrity, but when his breakthrough came it was breathtaking. Djokovic started the 2011 season with a 42-match winning streak, during which he dismantled Nadal in consecutive weeks on clay by daring to attack the most feared forehand in the world.By the end of that year, he had captured three of the four slams and he stood at the summit of a changed sport. One of the most revealing perspectives of the shift was a simple video compilation of his post-match handshakes with Nadal as warm hugs became chilly handshakes. A distant challenger had ascended to an equal.In the meantime, Djokovic has spent the decade making his case to be the greatest. He has flipped both head-to-heads, from 4-14 against Nadal in 2009 and 6-13 against Federer in 2010 to 29-26 and 27-23 today. He has been the common thread in innumerable classics, such as the 10 hours and 43 minutes of madness that comprised the semi-final and final of the 2012 Australian Open against Andy Murray and Nadal.Most important, his dominance has yielded some of the most transcendent (and most under‑appreciated) achievements in the history of tennis. By winning Roland Garros in 2016, he became only the third male player to simultaneously hold all four grand slam titles and the only player to do so across three different surfaces, and he broke the ATP ranking points record. In 2018 he became the only player to capture every variety of slam, Masters 1000 and World Tour Finals title.With Djokovic, the discourse never fails to revert to discussions of personality and popularity. As the person who burst in and ended the dominance of the two most popular male players, there are contests he will never win. The actual tennis is far more interesting. While the effortlessness of Federer’s game and the endless grit within Nadal are constant tropes, it can be difficult to convey succinctly why Djokovic is their equal.Djokovic’s strengths are clear. His ability to throw himself at full speed into low splits on either wing is astounding and has popularised sliding on hard courts. He is statistically one of the best returners of all time and his two-handed backhand has few equals. As his recovery from double championship point down in the fifth set of last year’s Wimbledon final against Federer showed, when the pressure is suffocating and everything is on the line, no player in history has been able to find such mental clarity in chaos.Those strengths lead people to characterise Djokovic as a relentless grinder. But he is so much more. His serve has grown into a quietly devastating weapon, constantly generating free points and short returns. On the slowest of slow clay he can shred any opponent to dust, yet on faster courts he can be ruthlessly efficient. Djokovic’s game is easiest to appreciate live, where the difficulty for opponents of his frequent direction changes and the varying amount of spin he puts on the ball are more clear. A large part of his greatness is that he is so difficult to read. He can approach a match however he likes and the person on the other side of the net will often not grasp his intentions until the match is done.The decade-long race between the big three will soon come to an end. Djokovic, 33, collected his 17th slam title at this year’s Australian Open, which puts him two slams from Nadal, 34, and three from Federer, 38. There is already a compelling argument that his head-to-head against all rivals, top-10 wins and the sheer magnitude of having to constantly break through the Federer-Nadal duopoly is enough.Regardless, Djokovic continues to chase them down with speed. The No 1 has not lost a match this year and, after his third title of 2020 in Dubai, he said that his goal is to finish the season unbeaten. He later clarified that he was joking, but nobody laughed. After all, if anyone at all is capable of such an achievement, it is him and nobody else.17 grand slam singles titles Australian Open 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020 French Open 2016 Wimbledon 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 US Open 2011, 2015, 2018 79 singles titles in all 282 weeks as world No 1Paris has irretrievably fallen in love with Novak Djokovic and remains quietly indifferent to the moody charm of the man he defeated soundly on Sunday, Andy Murray. The courting of the Serb began in two failed finals against their near-invincible nine-times king, Rafael Nadal, bloomed when he fell again, tearfully, in the face of a muscular onslaught by Stan Wawrinka a year ago, and was sealed in the final on Sunday when he defeated Murray in four sets, his victory speech blessed from above as the sun pierced clouds that had held Roland Garros in their gloomy grip for a week. After three hours and three minutes, the world No 1 prevailed 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, his 24th win against Murray in 34 matches, to reaffirm the established order in a sport he now dominates like nobody else has in the Open era. Even the man in the stands whose 47-year-old mark he matched by completing a set of four concurrently held majors, Rod Laver, must have wondered how good this great champion would have been in any era. If he were to go on to do the calendar grand slam with wins at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows to go with his Australian Open title, the clamour to embrace Djokovic as potentially the best player of all time will be an irresistible crescendo.Kevin Mitchell, the , 5 June 2016"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a5c2de4db50b5cd93aad0399b74afa9595681b4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474ec74abeae8dfbc6e25a26a7de6c2d","title":"favourite uk theatres mac birmingham leicester playhouse nottingham playhouse citizens glasgow sadlers wells lyric belfast","story":"Arts venues have been hit hard by the pandemic and are still unable to stage live performances. In a new series, we celebrate their essential roleHelen Monks: When I was a kid I used to go to Mac for the chips. It’s also where, between the ages of 11 and 18, I went to my free weekly drama club, funded by ITV and the BBC – the Television Workshop. Any kid who was good at acting, no matter how much your parents earned, could go. It’s produced actors including Jack O’Connell, Samantha Morton, Felicity Jones and, obvs, me. The Mac is in Birmingham’s Cannon Hill Park, one of the best parks ever, apart from the very scary geese. The fact it’s in one of the best parks ever means anyone there for a picnic, or wandering through or running away from the very scary geese, can nip into Mac, have a sit, have a look around and then maybe, sometimes even accidentally, partake in some art. It has a cinema, exhibition spaces, workshop spaces and three brilliant theatres.Sacha Dhawan: The first time I was granted access to the world beyond the stage door was in 2001. My company at the Leicester Haymarket when I made my debut in East Is East not only looked like me, but collectively we were able to share our own stories in a safe space without the fear of feeling “different”. I felt heard, celebrated even. Our audiences weren’t regular theatregoers, but rather members of a community who, like me, often felt alien and wanted to be represented. In a way, the theatre strived to bridge the gap between us all by creating a space that allowed us to communicate with one another over shared experiences. It also marked the start of a crucial relationship with the arts that would forever continue to shape and challenge me. The Leicester Haymarket recently handed its lease back to the council, and went into liquidation as a result of the current crisis.Indhu Rubasingham: Nottingham Playhouse has a very special place in my heart. At the age of 16, school placed me at the theatre for my work experience. I had never been there before. I was anxious as I started. I followed stage management around one very hot August. They generously introduced me to the magical world of backstage. I was blown away and then hooked. I relished setting the props, sweeping the stage, being in the wings as the show started. I wanted to be part of this secret, colourful world with all my heart. Without my local theatre, or the opportunity from school, I would not have the career I do now.Bunny Christie: Going to the Citizens theatre in Glasgow in 1980 made me a designer. Everything about it was exotic and exciting. As a girl brought up in a small village, going to the Citz in the Gorbals was like travelling to a foreign country. It was always dark, always raining, the theatre sat on its own, surrounded by potholes and puddles, everything else seemed to have been pulled down.Giles Havergal, the artistic director – immaculately dressed in a dinner suit – met the audience at the door, welcoming them into the glowing foyer. On stage were the most beautiful, lithe, languid actors imaginable. White-faced, dark-eyed, quite often half-naked, smoking, draped over a chair or clambering over a haze-filled, half-destroyed library of all-white books. Phillip Prowse’s designs of extraordinary style, invention and bravery entranced me. It was like a dream, and the feeling of that has never left me.Matthew Bourne: It is not only a world famous and iconic powerhouse for dance and dancers, Sadler’s Wells is also my second home, woven into the fabric of my life and career for more than 40 years. I saw my very first ballet there at the age of 18 – Swan Lake, of course! Some 17 years later I was to premiere my own version on the same hallowed stage. As a proud associate artist I have performed there, rehearsed there and been an audience member on numerous occasions. My company, New Adventures, took up residence there for our Christmas seasons 18 years ago and have remained a fixture ever since. Thank you, Sadler’s Wells, for a lifetime of unforgettable memories, enriching experiences and pure inspiration.Stacey Gregg: Lyric theatre, Belfast. I remember the smell. I remember it always felt like autumn. I remember hearing its name and saying it out loud in the hope I might be taken and then finally, a school trip to see Brian Friel’s Translations. I remember travelling on two buses to deliver three stirring lines in a youth production. The old building was replaced by a beautiful new building with extraordinary rehearsal space and a big airy bar. The Queen dropped by and hung out with Martin McGuinness there. The theatre chills over the river Lagan in leafy splendour and has produced some of our finest shows and been home to many more: most recently Abomination: A DUP Opera by the Belfast Ensemble and Outburst Arts.

It bills itself as “part radio play, part animated film” but seems like an off-shoot of the stage show, too, with the same director, Jonnie Riordan, and lead actor, Giles Cooper, who reprises the role of Slater. There is no younger actor playing Slater as a child in this production so he sounds adult from the start, but Cooper’s narration sweeps us in.Viewers receive a recipe card written by the celebrity chef, which in theory adds a sensory element to this already flavoursome story, but in reality is a prosaic email containing three recipes that does not add to the sensory drama. Still, the animations by Dean Kendrick and Mark Kendrick combine with the sumptuous descriptions of childhood dishes and recipes to become their own delicious thing. The Proustian madeleines in young Slater’s life are home-made jam tarts, mushrooms on toast and Walnut Whips that conjure up 1960s Englishness and the culinary remembrance of things past.Slater’s mother (Lizzie Muncey) dies in his childhood and food is intertwined with that maternal love and loss. Even if she is no great shakes in the kitchen, their cooking sessions seem to be where his passion stems from and there are heavy helpings of nostalgia as mother and son go shopping for crystallised figs and Turkish delights or make pastry. That sugary tone hollows out into a colder, harder story of grief and loneliness after she dies, but it is always accompanied by the joys and comforts of cooking.Sketches are drawn on the screen, coloured in and then washed away, newspaper adverts come alive, recipes are playfully written across images and there is a slow focus to the camerawork in some of the most emotional scenes. Sound effects add to its sensuousness, from the stirring of brandy into Christmas cake batter to popping toast and boiling pasta.Alongside Slater’s growing obsession for home economics at school, there is his father’s (Stephen Ventura) buzzing anxiety over his son’s sexuality – the young Slater is not allowed to buy fairy drops at the sweet shop and at at one point says: “You can’t go round eating girls’ sweets, what will people think?” Joan, the cleaner-turned-stepmother (Marie Lawrence) adds to the domestic conflict and his competitive cooking with her brings a comic “food war” but also trauma.The smell of baking is “like a blanket you want to wrap yourself in”, says Slater and it feels so here. Illustrations are simple and static but they gain emotional depth when set against the brutal undertows of the narrative – and they have a misty-eyed, mouth-watering power so that even a digestive biscuit is a trigger for grief, and spaghetti hoops come saturated with loneliness.Toast begins with a recipe for mince pies and ends with it too, though Slater has made a big emotional journey by then, from a lonely nine-year-old in Wolverhampton to the steps of the Savoy, a young man on his way to becoming the chef of today.• Toast is available online from 10-31 July.

He taught photography to the kids, but he also captured those moments when children discovered the strangeness and possibility of independence for the first time. Summers in bunk beds and cabins and woods stretched ahead of them, communal and lonely by turns. Part of the photographer’s motivation was to recapture the intensity of the periods he had spent away from his own family as a boy.His pictures are from different camps and different years but they share an emotional trajectory. The children arrive singly, clutching sleeping bags, they slowly overcome fears in ritualised games and campfire bonding, and they leave changed. In this picture the time away is coming to a close. The bus is waiting to return teenagers to the routine of home and school and TV. But as Steinmetz’s says: “Even if they’re miserable and bitching to one another throughout, by the end they’re like: ‘Oh my God, this is ending, you’re my best friend, and this has been the most intense thing I’ve ever done in my life!’”One of the things that strikes you most about these images – now collected in a book, Summer Camp – is how unselfconscious the children seem in the presence of the camera they don’t yet know all the angles. It is probably no coincidence Steinmetz gave up his project with the arrival of ubiquitous digital photography. He has persisted in working with film, and in black-and-white, over the years since because he “prefers the way film describes the light”. His summer camp pictures make that argument, which is less about nostalgia than a kind of emotional connection. “With digital,” Steinmetz has said, “every object in the frame seems slightly distinct and separate from every other element in the frame whereas silver prints have more internal harmony – they feel less nervous.” Summer Camp by Mark Steinmetz is published by Nazraeli Press (£50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b8ee4429227949ae33c98106f6a06d216ecbb2/5_0_2497_1500/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcd510cbc478c361f4ef85164cc6b092","title":"10 best russian novels russia modern writers","story":"This list of novels and novellas will help you explore Russia’s vast landscapes and complex history Add your favourites to the commentsI spent several years wandering round Russia with books in my rucksack. And several more years reviewing Russian fiction and finding myself transported back, whether to a village with chickens pecking through orchards round a wooden church or to a drunken kitchen table debate in a high-rise overlooking the Moscow suburbs. This subjective list of engaging, relatively readable novels and novellas recreates various Russian landscapes, eras and atmospheres, often in ways that no amount of travelling could. As Ludmila Ulitskaya writes in The Big Green Tent: “Military historians have found many discrepancies in Tolstoy’s description of the Battle of Borodino, but the whole world imagines the event just as Tolstoy described it in War and Peace.”A bored young man inherits a country estate, where a shy, book-loving local girl falls for him. Alexander Pushkin, father of Russian literature, crams laughter, literature, duelling and tempestuous romance into his playful 1820s verse novel. A series of distilled Russian settings serve as backdrops. First: theatres, dancing, lamplit snowy streets, soft summer nights by the glass-smooth River Neva and hungover rides home in the Petersburg morning-after. Then young Onegin’s rich uncle dies, leaving him the country estate, boasting a “vast garden, overgrown with wistful dryads set in stone.” Inside, there are brocaded walls, portraits of tsars, tiled stoves and homemade liqueurs. Pushkin lovingly details (although they bore the novel’s hero) traditional rye beer, berry picking, seething samovars and little dishes of jam. So, finally, to Moscow, “chiselled in white stone  the buildings topped with fiery glory  A golden cross on every dome”.• Translated by Anthony Briggs, Pushkin PressMoscow exerts a strong gravitational force on writers, just as it does on Chekhov’s three sisters with their refrain, “To Moscow, to Moscow…” One of the subtlest evocations of modern Moscow is Oleg Zaionchkovsky’s Happiness is Possible, a series of darkly comic vignettes published in 2012. The narrator is a struggling novelist whose ambitious wife has left him. Discursive, fatalistic and fond of sleeping in the day, he is reminiscent of Ivan Goncharov’s sluggish hero Oblomov, Russian literature’s traditional “superfluous man”. What his story lacks in plot, it amply repays in dishevelled charm and style. He shuffles, unshaven, through the dacha village of Vaskovo and fills the abandoned apartment with dog hair and ashtrays. Zaionchkovsky’s narrator conveys the city’s magnetic pull, finding a secret solace and reassurance in the deafening noise: “We are Muscovites, children of the metro time and again we seek refuge in its maternal womb.”• Translated by Andrew Bromfield, And Other StoriesThe palatial metro system is one of the best things about Moscow. Several novels take place in its tunnels, including Mikhail Glukhovsky’s dystopian  2033, first in a series of philosophical, post-apocalyptic underground adventures. Hamid Ismailov’s The Underground uses metro stations to structure the posthumous reminiscences of young Kirill. Born nine months after the 1980 Olympics to a Siberian mother and an African father, Kirill dies soon after the collapse of the USSR a decade later. There are recurrent images of the metro as a body, with “stone intestines” or marble pillars like a woman’s legs, “bare to the hip”. Exiled Uzbek author Hamid Ismailov has woven this poignant story, a fictionalised memoir inspired by episodes from his and his family’s own peripatetic lives, into a haunting landscape-tapestry of 20th-century Moscow.• Translated by Carol Ermakova, Restless BooksBoris Akunin, whose real name is Grigory Chkhartishvili, is famous for his bestselling series of clever, tsarist-era thrillers. If you haven’t read any, start with The Winter Queen, which introduces the brilliantly understated detective work of diplomat-turned-sleuth Erast Fandorin. In He Lover of Death, Oliver Twist meets Treasure Island as we follow the adventures of orphaned urchin Senka through 19th-century Moscow. Akunin recreates the slums of Khitrovka, full of spiced tea stalls and gangsters in shiny boots (today the area is all banks and top-end restaurants, of course). Senka finds a hoard of antique silver bars, hires a student to teach him how to be a gentleman and is soon at the theatre, marvelling that people will pay “seven roubles to sit in a prickly collar for three hours” and watch “men in tight underpants jumping about”. The tale’s gruesome denouement has a characteristic blend of action, deduction, intrigue and morality.• Translated by Andrew Bromfield, Orion 2010Florence Pugh played the title role in an unflinching 2016 film version of this brutal 19th-century novella, a tale of provincial lust and murder. If people have heard of Nikolai Leskov at all, it’s usually because of Lady Macbeth. Dostoevsky first published it in his literary magazine and Shostakovich later turned it into an ill-fated opera. From the bored merchant’s wife, romping with a newly arrived farmhand under moonlit apple blossom, to a chilling denouement near the “dark, gape-jawed waves” of the leaden Volga, the story showcases Leskov’s restless evocation of place and passion. The setting, with its buckwheat kasha and icon lamps, has bureaucratic warrants and certificates alongside folkloric elements: the locked-up tower of the merchant’s house and the wife’s lover, “like a bright falcon”.• In The Enchanted Wanderer and other stories, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky, VintageOne hundred years after the 1917 revolution, a gem cutter called Krylov falls in love in a Russian city where centenary celebrations lead to repeated cycles of violence. Meanwhile, gem prospectors or “rock hounds” search for precious stones in the mythical Riphean mountains (inspired by Slavnikova’s native Urals). This winner of the 2006 Russian Booker Prize is a genre-defying mashup of speculative fiction, magic realism, romance and thriller. Among many prescient interwoven threads are an ecological catastrophe triggered by human greed, and an epidemic of nostalgia, sparking civil war. In St Petersburg, costumed revolutionary sailors try to fire a museum tank gun at the Winter Palace and in Moscow the toppled monument to murderous security chief Felix Dzerzhinsky is resurrected (this bit almost came true recently). There’s an evocative Russianness in the novel’s linguistic subtlety, the fantastical mountain gorges, the cavalcades on city streets and the pervasive, Kafkaesque sense of strangeness.• Translated by Marian Schwartz, Overlook DuckworthA war-wounded teacher arrives at a 1950s Moscow school and forms a Dead Poets Society-style club, where he leads the boys through the city streets, peeling back the layers of its literary and historical palimpsest. One dilapidated house, where two of the boys later lose their virginity, provides a physical metaphor for Moscow’s strata: “Its walls had been covered in silk, then in empire wallpaper, … in crude oil paint, … then layers of newsprint…” Ulitskaya is always redolent and readable. The interlocking stories in The Big Green Tent revolve around two groups of school friends. This generous novel, ning four decades of Soviet life, has a Tolstoyan ambition to capture the spirit of an age. Beyond the deftly drawn settings (trams, ice skating, Karelian birchwood furniture) is a powerful sense of cultural baggage. “We live not in nature, but in history,” Ulitskaya writes, as her protagonists walk down a lane once trodden by Pushkin and later Pasternak, “skirting the eternal puddles.”• Translated by Polly Ganon, PicadorThe Russian authorities are planning to build a wall to isolate the troublesome Caucasus from the rest of the country. That’s the rumour that drives Alisa Ganieva’s 2012 novel, set in a dystopian-yet-real version of her hometown of Makhachkala, Dagestan’s coastal capital city. Shamil, a young Dagestani reporter, wanders the streets while his girlfriend, Madina, dons a hijab and heads for the hills to marry a murderous zealot. It’s another prophetic narrative and Ganieva’s picture of the social and psychological fallout of apocalyptic events feels a bit near the knuckle in 2020. A few years ago, I joined a press trip to Makhachkala to see a new art exhibition and take a trip (with armed escort) into the waterfall-braided mountains. Dagestan is not really a holiday destination, even when there’s no pandemic, and a novel about Islamic radicalisation isn’t likely to encourage tourists. But Ganieva skilfully uses words from some of the 30-odd local languages and fragments of poems, fables, dreams and diaries to evoke this erse republic sandwiched between war-torn Chechnya and the Caspian Sea.• Translated by Carol Apollonio, Deep VellumBoris Alikhanov, an alcoholic, unpublished author, finds work as a summer guide in the Pushkin Hills museum, as Dovlatov himself once did. The atmosphere of Russia’s old towns and zapovedniki (natureheritage reserves) is conjured up in this novel, set on Alexander Pushkin’s old family estate. It’s not just the physical details that resonate (log houses girdled by birch trees, linden-shaded boulevards, old ladies selling flowers outside the monastery), but also the absurdly reverential guides and clueless tourists. The comedy of Pushkin Hills coexists with bittersweet meditations on creativity, loss and identity. Alikhanov derides Soviet authors who hanker after folk verses and embroidered towels but, explaining to his wife why he won’t emigrate, he says that while he “couldn’t care less about birch trees”, he would miss “my language, my people, my crazy country”.• Translated by Katherine Dovlatov, Alma ClassicsFrom a bomb-making scientist in a secret city called Ensk to starving, smoking teenage ballet dancers filling each other’s pointe shoes with ground glass, The Women of Lazarus flirts with Russia’s enduring cliches even as it constructs a profound and richly sensory tale about human interaction. The chapters trace a series of related family stories through a century of Soviet and post-Soviet joys and tragedies. It opens with young Lidochka at the beach, where her mother is about to drown. “Lazarus” is her grandfather, a talented physicist who appeared at Moscow University, dirty and lice-ridden, seven decades earlier. The women include his wife, Galina Petrovna, who looks after orphaned Lidochka, and whose perfume smells of “orange tree honey, raspberry, ambergris, opoponax, and coriander”. Stepnova continually reframes our perspectives, showing us how human beings can adapt to almost anything.• Translated by Lisa Hayden, World Editions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8a105d51d87bc001ebc6a0352c3509fe69bfe49/0_370_5554_3333/master/5554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=933d699d277cd0b87859e667ca32d487","title":"first post lockdown stay london hotel the dixon tower bridge","story":"Check in at The Dixon near Tower Bridge … where staff are doing all they can to provide a bit of pampering while social distancing and keeping guests safe‘I’m afraid I can’t take your bags,” says the manager of The Dixon, a boutique hotel just south of Tower Bridge. He greets me in the lobby on reopening day (Saturday 4 July) after the pandemic forced the hotel to close for four months. A smile beams from behind the clear plastic visor that covers his face. “We have a new procedure, you see.”That procedure goes like this: when guests arrive they are directed to a non-contact temperature scanner and hand-sanitiser station. If a guest’s temperature is below 38C, they can proceed to reception where a masked clerk checks them in from behind a plastic screen. There, guests are offered a face covering and talked through the changes. Namely, that the gym is closed there is no breakfast buffet (guests need to preorder) that social distancing must be maintained and that should you need help with your luggage, you are to leave it with staff, who’ll sanitise it using a fogger machine before dropping it to your room.The Dixon is in a Grade II-listed Edwardian building that was formerly a courthouse and police station. Walking across the original tiled floors – that still bear police insignia – up the grand central staircase, past the Murano glass chandelier and through the contemporary art-lined corridors, it is clear this is an upmarket hotel with a clientele that expects to be well-tended to. Given that the usual flourishes of high-end service often involve getting physically close to a guest, this could pose a problem. But staff at The Dixon are keen to ensure that the pre-Covid-19 experience is maintained, and are using technology and effort to do it.Menus, for example, are now QR codes to reduce touchpoints. Tables do not have cutlery laid out on them rather they’re brought out upon an order. At breakfast (currently served in the hotel’s main restaurant, The Provisioners), plates are not brought directly to the table, but to a nearby table an arm’s reach away to help maintain distance. But dinner – which mostly consists of gastropub classics-made-fancy (wagyu beef burger) and which is served in the hotel bar – is hand-delivered to tables. That’s because the seated-only bar has a smaller capacity, making it possible for staff to keep on top of the relevant cleaning needed to deliver a good-old-days service.Indeed, it is those flourishes – hand-delivered, handmade cocktails, a slice of normality that is only possible through gargantuan effort – that make you feel pampered. The pleasure of restaurant-quality food after months of cooking for myself cannot be overstated, nor the joy of a shower with multiple pulse settings, a king-size bed and a coffee machine all to myself. Enjoying this is only possible because I feel I am being constantly assured of my safety by the meticulous staff (they even leave stickers on common touchpoints in my room, such as the remote control, reading: “your room has been sanitised”).And it helps that the hotel was nearly empty. The Dixon has 193 rooms but only 25 are taken when I stay. Currently when a guest checks out, their room is cleaned twice – a standard clean and a deeper clean by a team using disinfectant vapour to get into hard to reach areas. Some hotels, in the US for example, are choosing to leave rooms empty for up to 48 hours after checkout so that cleaners are not unwittingly spreading the virus.That’s easier to do in larger hotels that have the room capacity to do so, but I can’t help but wonder how small independent hotels and B\u0026ampBs will cope with the extra work needed to keep rooms open. The Dixon is also a Marriott hotel, so benefits from having access to their large-scale solutions, like accessing temperature-checking devices which are in short supply globally.That’s not to say The Dixon’s system is flawless. I asked what might happen if a guest arrived with a high temperature and was surprised to hear they’d still be allowed in, albeit asked to self-isolate in their room. Plus, both the restaurant and bar are open to the general public. The hotel also has a small conference room with its own bar, which is proving popular with wedding enquiries (currently wedding parties of up to 30 are allowed). It is still a long way off, but how safe would the hotel feel on a busy weekend, with a wedding party, hotel guests and passing punters to serve?Before I head home, I pass through nearby Maltby Street Market where street foodies struggle to keep a distance from each other and few are wearing masks. I walk past Tower Bridge to find TikTokers and Instagrammers making content in the bridge’s backdrop, close to kerbside revellers enjoying the newly reopened pubs. I slip past a line for a shop, where queuers looking at their phones forget to distance. None of these scenarios are perfect, and each carries risk. As with everything, it is up to would-be guests to assess how much risk they feel comfortable with when considering booking. But back at the hotel the procedures are in place, ready for those who walk through its newly-reopened doors.• Accommodation was provided by The Dixon, which has doubles from £149 B\u0026ampB"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c3d3b27eb0ecafb680b6c13f592edb768cf27fc/554_1117_3423_2053/master/3423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7925ce90b2cf303f7678ee349bb4446f","title":"what happens when a bloke hops into the lift with you post lockdown in a manchester hotel","story":"As an aparthotel, the Native is well set up for social distancing, but is Manchester’s wider Northern Quarter as welcoming?Well this feels strange, doesn’t it? Leaving the house. With plans. Being able to sleep in a hotel room and sink a pint on Saturday night. But only, in my case, after sitting masked on an eerily empty tram as it trundles past the Nightingale Hospital North West, a reminder of how precarious England’s rush into the new normal might be.If travelling into Manchester city centre from its suburbs feels unreal, imagine the leap of faith it would require to book a city-break right now. Yet, at the 166-room Native aparthotel, 60 rooms sold late last week to … someone. Its public ground floor – previously bar, restaurant, cinema and Cultureplex arts space, now Ducie Street Warehouse – is reasonably busy with a glammed-up and self-consciously hip Northern Quarter crowd. None older than 32. Does the world now belong to health-confident 20-somethings? Possibly.Native is currently operating on a limited basis. In-house gym Blok is Joe Wicks-ing classes to rooms, the arts programme is on hold, the restaurant will return in risk-assessed stages. At opening, two chefs had been working in the huge open-kitchen on a limited menu for Counter, a bar and grocery store where guests can buy (creditably tasty, well-executed) food and drink with minimal staff interaction and very limited table service. If you prefer real seclusion, you can pick-up meals to reheat in your room each has a high-spec kitchen.The Covid-19 changes made in the lounge – a vast, handsome space designed at that wood-panelled point where Mad Men meets Scandi minimalism – have been subtly executed. It does not set alarm bells ringing. The plastic screens at reception are already familiar and because staff largely stay behind those screens or suitably distant (no luggage storage contactless payments and key drop no room clean during stays), they are not wearing PPE. (Though full PPE is available should staff have to enter a guest’s room.)The staff – who are happy to talk Covid-19, no-one is pretending it isn’t happening – will not clear tables in the lounge until a party leaves and some tables (ided by more plastic screens), chairs and even urinals are out-of-use to enhance social-distancing. But none of this feels problematic. Now physical menus are out, the QR code you use works seamlessly. Similarly, around a stunning five-floor atrium that celebrates this building’s rivets-and-girders industrial past, the bedrooms each have a “clean seal” on the door on arrival, but a lot of the Covid-19 detail (two-stage deep clean of everything leaving rooms 72-hours between guests the long overdue removal of throws and cushions), may happily pass you by.Yet there are moments of apprehension. Every door handle or lift button is now a possible site of infection, which throws up a novel complaint. Native’s widely available hand-sanitiser is weirdly sticky and evaporates too slowly. A potentially alarming bottle of tomato sauce appears on the table at breakfast. Isn’t it all sachets now? Then there are the other guests. Do you kick-off when a bloke hops into the lift with you, despite the one-party per lift rule? Or try not to breathe for four floors?Such anxieties fall away after two pints (Magic Rock’s Inhaler), which may be the problem with hospitality reopening. Listening to vintage disco and Grace Jones in the lounge, it feels like Saturday night. For visitors, however, the wider Northern Quarter may not be so welcoming.Largely pedestrianised, bars now spill confusingly out onto streets and squares. As a newcomer, scoping them out would be difficult as staff in PPE-visors shuttle about amid bewildering queues and signs on one-way systems, take-out hatches, ordering apps and contacts registration. Most of my haunts – Peer Hat, Soup Kitchen, Smithfield, Marble Arch – sat reopening out. Port Street Beer House was only taking pre-booked groups. Clubs and music venues remain closed. On a city-break, navigating all this will take a new level of organisation.With its Conran furniture and Manhattan loft looks, Native still feels like a luxurious treat.

However, confusion remains over which countries Britons can visit without facing restrictions on arrival. Currently, this is 25 – out of the government’s list of 74.Many of the destinations on the list still have their own restrictions in place. Australia and New Zealand’s borders remain closed to international tourists and Austria, Cyprus and Japan have restrictions on countries that have seen high levels of coronavirus, including the UK.On Friday, the Department for Transport (DfT) published its list of  travel corridors, with 74 countries (including 14 British overseas territories). Arrivals from this list of countries (both overseas tourists entering and UK nationals returning) will not face quarantine in England – although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to announce if and when they will lift the restrictions. In addition, the Foreign Office (FCO) updated its advice for a list of 67 countries it no longer considers high-risk, to allow for non-essential travel, although many of these countries still have their own restrictions or bans in place.Regardless of whether the UK government says it is safe to travel to a country, each destination has its own rules on who can enter. Some countries may not permit UK nationals to enter and they may ban anyone who has been in the UK in the previous 14 days. Security measures could also be in place at borders to prevent potential loopholes for passengers attempting to transit through other “safe” countries in order to dodge travel bans.Although there are now many destinations open to UK tourists without restrictions, some may still have health screening on arrival or an entry form to complete before leaving. Arrivals from the UK may also face restrictions if they have travelled to other countries in the 14 days prior. Countries not listed below may require testing on arrival, mandatory quarantine or have outright bans on arrivals from the UK.

Just north of the Standing Rock reservation, it crosses beneath the Missouri river. The tribe draws its water from the river and fears pollution. Texas-based Energy Transfer insists the pipeline is safe.In December 2016, the Obama administration denied permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri and ordered a full environmental review to analyze alternative routes and the impact on the tribe’s treaty rights.In his first week in office, Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite construction. Construction was completed in June 2017.The tribe challenged the permits – and won.

The base and a finger were damaged.Carvin Eison, who worked on the project which brought the statues to the city, told the Democrat \u0026amp Chronicle newspaper: “It’s particularly painful that it happened at this time … It’s really sad because here in Rochester the statue of Frederick Douglass has always been a face of good.”The statue would be replaced, he said.Since the killing of George Floyd, an African American man, in Minneapolis on 25 May prompted nationwide protests against police brutality and structural racism, statues of Confederate leaders and others with outdated views on race have been targeted for protest, vandalism and removal.Donald Trump has placed himself at the head of a counter-movement, defending Confederate heritage and, over the Fourth of July weekend, calling for the creation of his own sculpture park, or “National Garden of American Heroes”, in defiance of supposed “far-left fascism”.Though the perpetrators of the Rochester removal remain unknown, in a Monday morning tweet, Trump said it showed “these anarchists have no bounds!” and linked to a piece by the far-right Breitbart News.Speaking to WROC, Eison asked: “Is this some type of retaliation because of the national fever over Confederate monuments right now? Very disappointing, it’s beyond disappointing.”In 2018, two students were arrested for vandalising another Douglass statue in the city.Douglass’s own views on such monuments have come into focus in Washington DC, where a statue of Abraham Lincoln and a formerly enslaved man has been the subject of calls for removal.In an 1876 letter recently discovered by a historian, Douglass writes: “The negro here, though rising, is still on his knees and nude. What I want to see before I die is a monument representing the negro, not couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man.”He also says the Lincoln statue is “admirable” and adds: “The mere act of breaking the negro’s chains was the act of Abraham Lincoln and is beautifully expressed in this monument.”Douglass escaped from slavery in Maryland in 1838 and eventually made Rochester his home, though he also lived in Washington. He died in 1895 and is buried in Mount Hope cemetery, in Rochester.He gave his speech on the Fourth of July and slavery on 5 July 1852, two years after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act and as the nation slid towards disunion and, in 1861, civil war.Douglass was a fierce campaigner who in 1855, in another Rochester speech, famously said: “I would unite with anybody to do right, and with nobody to do wrong.”But his 1852 speech is a powerful rebuke to America’s white majority, then celebrating the 76th anniversary of independence from Britain.Douglass commends the revolutionary spirit, saying “the eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times”.He adds: “To side with the right, against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! Here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day.”But he goes on to tell his white audience: “The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me.“This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony.”To a slave, Douglass says, America’s annual celebration of independence is “a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c2a1fbc5b270a5f4bb7d01073916dd0189e95c/0_75_3282_1970/master/3282.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1a8dc018d72b9a500737dcb9d37b428d","title":"france new prime minister jean castex reshuffled cabinet macron","story":"Jean Castex likely to replace key ministers in effort to revive Macron’s presidencyFrance’s new prime minister, Jean Castex, is to unveil his cabinet, three days after President Emmanuel Macron gambled on a reshuffle to reboot his presidency and tighten his grip on government in the run-up to a re-election bid in 2022.Analysts said Castex, a relatively unknown career bureaucrat and provincial mayor who successfully ran France’s exit from its coronavirus lockdown, needed to move decisively to convince voters he was the right choice for the job.The president tweeted on Sunday that he was aiming for a “new path” focused on “reviving the economy, continuing to overhaul social and environmental protections, re-establishing a fair republican order and defending European sovereignty”.With the Élysée Palace promising “new faces and new talents”, several key ministers could be replaced, including the widely criticised Christophe Castaner at the interior ministry, the economic minister Bruno Le Maire and Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly at foreign affairs and defence.Environment will also be a key portfolio, given the recent strong performance of the Greens, who seized control of several of France’s biggest cities in last month’s municipal elections.Observers have said that by replacing Philippe with Castex, who also hails from the centre-right Les Républicains (LR) party, Macron had taken a high-stakes gamble on taking fuller control of government in the final two years of his presidency.With most of Macron’s efforts since 2017 to create jobs, boost investment and relax labour likely “to be buried by an avalanche of bad news”, the president “has decided, in effect, to be his own prime minister for the last two years of his mandate”, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.Castex, who speaks with a marked south-west accent that the Élysée Palace hopes will connect with ordinary people, “will be the manager and de facto chief of staff, while Macron takes direct control of government in a lightning attempt to create a new record which he can present to the electorate in 2022”, Rahman said.The new prime minister “will have to shift up a gear, especially on the economy, against a likely context this autumn of rising unemployment, young people arriving on the labour market … He has to show this change of prime minister was useful.”Many analysts had predicted that Macron would choose his new prime minister from the more leftwing, pro-ecology side of French politics, especially after a disappointing performance by his centrist La République en Marche (LREM) party in the elections last month.Much of the French left feels the president, having promised a politics that was “neither of the right nor of the left”, has drifted rightwards since sweeping to victory in presidential and parliamentary elections in 2017.But centre-right voters have, in the main, applauded his firm handling of the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests and supported LREM in last year’s European election. “He is counting on them, it seems to me, for re-election in 2022,” Jean Garrigues, a political scientist at the University of Orleans, told Agence France-Presse.LREM failed to win a single big city in the local elections, depriving the president of a powerful local power base before 2022. The most notable win was Philippe’s convincing victory in his Normandy bastion of Le Havre, from where he emerged as a potential Macron rival in years to come.The president’s entourage has hinted that he plans to announce the key policy lines of the remainder of his mandate in a televised address, probably on Bastille Day, 14 July. Castex is likely to leave any detailed announcement to parliament of his government’s programme until the end of next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d5f6cd50809650e7d753e3c320a863c85f4239/0_108_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabc5fd127106d16e812169b7707159","title":"london law firm did pr for malaysian fugitive accused of corruption","story":"Schillings, which represents the Duchess of Sussex, was paid $1.3m for work for Jho Low, financier at centre of 1MDB scandalThe law firm that represents the Duchess of Sussex has received $1.3m (£1m) for its work on a public relations campaign for a fugitive Malaysian financier accused of masterminding one of the world’s largest corruption scandals, documents show.Schillings, a London-based firm that specialises in managing the reputations of wealthy clients, was paid the sum for working for the fugitive businessman Jho Low between January 2019 and March 2020, according to US lobbying disclosures. Some of its activities were aimed at “informing public opinion” in the US.Low is accused by US and Malaysian prosecutors of orchestrating a vast money-laundering scheme that embezzled billions of dollars from a Malaysian state investment fund, 1MDB, via an elaborate network of offshore companies to pay bribes, finance luxury lifestyles, and fund the Hollywood movie The Wolf of Wall Street.The scandal led to the downfall and trial of Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, and has sparked investigations into major financial institutions Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.Low, who has denied any wrongdoing, is facing two US criminal indictments and is reportedly the subject of international arrest notices. Last year the US Department of Justice (DoJ) seized more than $700m of assets allegedly connected to the fraud as part of a civil forfeiture settlement with Low, having already seized his custom-made $250m superyacht.Over the past two years, Low has embarked on a multimillion-dollar public relations offensive and hired an army of lawyers and PR advisers. Disclosures submitted to the DoJ under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara) show Schillings has supported this effort, providing “legal and consulting advice and research in support of the work” of PR advisers.The latest disclosures, submitted by the firm’s US subsidiary last month, include a breakdown of fees for the services it has to report under Fara, which requires representatives of foreign iniduals, companies or governments to file reports about their lobbying and influence activities and how much they are paid.Schillings has disclosed its work included helping to prepare press releases and maintain a website for Low. The website describes the fugitive as “a global philanthropist, investor, and entrepreneur” who believes “he will be vindicated once all the relevant evidence has been presented in a fair and legitimate court of law”.Disclosures also show that a London-based PR and crisis management agency, the PHA Group, run by the former editor of the News of the World and Hello! magazine Phil Hall, has received almost £275,000 since 2018 for representing Low. Both Schilling and PHA were paid via Kobre \u0026amp Kim, a US law firm acting for Low, who is reportedly living in China.Filings suggest Low has become a significant client of Schillings, which recorded revenues of £16m in 2019. The firm’s work for Low attracted criticism in 2018 after it emerged it had sent threatening letters to booksellers aimed at blocking the distribution of a book by two Wall Street Journal reporters that described Low’s alleged involvement in the 1MDB conspiracy.A lawyer for Schillings responded on behalf of both the law firm and PHA to the ’s request for comment. He said both Schillings and PHA had complied with all applicable laws and regulations and had “nothing further to add” to the contents of the Fara filings.Meghan hired Schillings last year before launching legal proceedings against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter she wrote to her father. The move was seen as a departure from the royal family’s longstanding solicitors in favour of a firm with a reputation for working aggressively against the media on behalf of its clients.In recent years, Schillings has begun offering its wealthy clients the services of intelligence professionals, behavioural psychologists and former military personnel alongside its lawyers. It has recruited former senior UK officials as top advisers, including the former national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant and former head of GCHQ Robert Hannigan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf435fe7b9ed0cf24bc8762efd2955b9fa95028/0_68_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b37dd6b3a5bc630267c6ebfabc90a27","title":"uk charities face soaring demand for grief counselling due to covid 19","story":"Bereaved families say they have been abandoned by the governmentBereavement charities in the UK predict demand for their services could double in 2020 because of the pandemic, as struggling families of Covid-19 victims call on the government for more funding for grief counselling.Cruse Bereavement Care, the largest bereavement charity in the UK, which helped 50,000 people in 2019, is anticipating an extra 20,000 to 50,000 clients this year, and is hoping to train more than 1,000 new volunteers to meet the demand.“We’re hugely experienced in dealing with other types of emergencies,” said its chief executive, Steven Wibberley. “Cruse has provided support at a number of major incidents including the Grenfell fire, the London Bridge stabbings, and the Manchester Arena bombing. Wind the clock back, we had a team that flew out to New York to support in the aftermath of 911.“But nothing at this scale, not the 60,000 excess deaths. This is unprecedented.”The charity offers one-to-one support at about 75 local branches around the country, a national helpline and an online webchat service, all staffed by a team of almost 5,000 volunteers – many of whom have backgrounds in counselling or therapy, although this isn’t a requirement.The number of calls to the helpline is higher than before lockdown, and they are lasting up to seven minutes longer on average as people struggle to deal with the shock and trauma of coronavirus deaths.Maureen Craig lost Geoffrey, her husband of 42 years, in April after he contracted the virus, and Cruse has been a lifeline for her daughter.“She has found them very helpful. I don’t think she would be in the place she’s in now if it wasn’t for the Cruse counselling she’s had. She was in a very, very bad way when she started it,” said Maureen.However, Maureen herself said face-to-face therapy sessions – currently unavailable to her because of lockdown – are the only thing that will help her through her grief, after experiencing panic attacks and PTSD.“When I get into bed at night, all I can hear is those phone calls, having to FaceTime my children to tell them their father was dying. Seeing him take his last breath, these things are burned on my eyelids, and I need therapy to get me through that,” she said.Other services are springing up to try to meet the demand. The National Bereavement Partnership, which ran for eight years until 2010, re-formed in April to add more capacity. “Services were already stretched, so we decided to come back to life again,” said its CEO, Michaela Willis. The charity offers a helpline and has applied for government funding to so it can expand into one-to-one support.Growing waiting lists are leaving some with no option but to pay for help. Kathryn de Prudhoe is a therapist in Leeds who lost her father, Tony Clay, aged 60, to Covid-19 in April. She contacted Cruse but, faced with a four- to six-week waiting list for one-to-one sessions, decided to pay for a private therapist instead.“I feel dramatically different now than I did three or four weeks ago. Some of the things that I was holding inside me, I’ve been able to say out loud, and that’s huge,” said De Prudhoe, a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group which is calling on the government for more support.“But there’s going to be thousands of people who just can’t afford to pay for private therapy and the free services that are around don’t have the resources to meet the need,” she said. “The government need to put up some funding for counselling support not just for bereaved families but for all people who’ve been impacted by the virus, whether it’s NHS workers or people who’ve been ill themselves.”The experience of dealing with grief during lockdown could also have significant repercussions, charities fear. “People have gone through this horrendous bereavement without being able to see their loved ones and without any support,” said Wibberley. “Over the next months and years, bereavement charities will be more important than ever.”This was echoed by Maureen Craig, who had to self-isolate alone at home for two weeks after her husband died. “All those support systems that I would normally have, who would sit and talk to me and hug me and comfort me when I have a panic attack, they’re not available to me,” she said.Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice feel they’ve been abandoned by the government, and say the mental health effects of the pandemic could become a timebomb if left unaddressed.“There has been no recognition of the emotional, psychological and potentially financial impact to the families that have been affected by this,” said De Prudhoe. “And there’s still 1,000 people a week dying. It’s not going away.”Cruse Bereavement Care can be contacted on 0808 808 1677, and the National Bereavement Partnership on 0800 448 0800."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

It says there have been a further 16 deaths, taking the official headline total to 44,236.This figure covers people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died in the UK. But it is not the full figure for coronavirus deaths because there have been another 10,000-odd deaths attributed to coronavirus where the person who died as not tested.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has ordered an urgent audit of statues, street and building names to address Wales’s connections with the slave trade.The Black Lives Matter movement has brought to the fore a number of important issues we need to address as a country. One is the need for Wales to reflect on the visible reminders of the country’s past. This is especially true when we look at the horrors of the slave trade.Some of our historic buildings are reminders of this painful period of our history. Some may appear to make heroes of historical figures whose actions we now condemn. Iniduals connected to the slave trade may be remembered in street names or the names of public buildings. They are commemorations of a past that we have not fully challenged and that we should challenge now.“We estimate that care providers were at approximately four times the risk of infection of similar working age iniduals in the country in that period,” said Dr Guy Harling, an author of the report from University College London.Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at UCL, vice-president of the Academy of Medical Sciences and a member of the Delve committee, said the report highlights the need to take action now as hospitals and other healthcare settings open up to tackle more non-Covid-19 related work.“This is a really important time for us to prepare we have got a window of opportunity now to get everything in place and to try also to be ready for winter and any other future waves of Covid-19,” she said.The report draws on a range of data, including the ONS survey looking at prevalence of Covid-19 in the community in England and the Vivaldi study from the ONS looking at infections in care homes, to explore the prevalence of Covid-19 among health and social care staff, as well as patients in hospital and residents in care homes.Back in the Lords committee Dido Harding says she is a retailer by trade. She say people judge you in retail by the quality of the experience. And in test and trace it is good, she says. She says most people get a test result by the following day. And she says from there people find their experience of dealing with the contact tracers positive.The evidence session with Harding is now over.Long-awaited UK government sanctions against human rights abusers in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Myanmar and North Korea have been unveiled by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Luke Harding report.Back in the Lords committee Dido Harding says the test and trace service has significant spare capacity in terms of contact tracers. That is because there are fewer daily cases than were anticipated.But she says it will need to expand testing capacity. That is because, as the winter approaches, there will be an increase in the number of people needing a test because they have symptoms - even if the overall number of coronavirus cases is not rising. (There will be people requesting a test who have flu, or a cold.) But she says she is confident that they can expand testing capacity.Simon Thompson, managing director of the NHS Covid-19 app, is also giving evidence to the Lords science committee alongside Dido Harding (or alongside her metaphorically - they are on Zoom.)He says he will be publishing a report on what was learned from the pilot in the Isle of Wight, which led to the original app being ditched.Aslef, the union that represents train drivers, has accused Boris Johnson of talking “nonsense” about driverless trains for the tube. (See 3.20pm.) Finn Brennan, the Aslef organiser for the London Underground, said:As always, Boris Johnson is talking nonsense about driverless trains.Slashing government funding to TfL means that they cannot afford the signalling upgrade and other technology that would be needed for driverless trains.While pretending to support a ‘great leap forward’, the prime minister’s policies are actually preventing any progress with transport in the capital.They mean that Londoners will suffer years of delays and overcrowding in the future.Harding says what she is trying to build is a “digitally assisted human service”, not a purely digital service. She says she is doubtful whether people would be willing to give up their freedom for two weeks just on the basis of a text message.Back at the Lords committee Dido Harding, head of the NHS test and trace scheme, says that if a contact-tracing app could be made to work, it would be a “significant benefit”. But she says she does not think any country in the world has developed an app that is working to a high enough standard for it to be used with confidence to advise people to self-isolate.The opposition parties have condemned the government’s decision to abandon attempts to publish daily figures for the number of iniduals tested for coronavirus. (See 1.03pm.)This is from Labour’s Justin Madders, a shadow health minister.This is an absolute shambles. It seems that the real reason why the government stopped issuing figures for the number of people tested each day is because they never hit their 100,000 people a day target and they were too embarrassed to admit it.We know that the number of people actually tested is less than a third of the number of tests they state are being completed. It is clear that Ministers are losing control over the testing regime and are failing to not only keep track of the tests but to ensure the results are returned swiftly. And this is from Layla Moran, the Lib Dem leadership candidate.First the government cancelled the daily press conferences, now they’ve stopped publishing the numbers of people who’ve actually been tested for coronavirus.It seems that at every stage, ministers are dodging scrutiny and covering up for their own failures. Making data public is vital to ensure decision-makers are held to account. This shows we need to ensure full transparency through an independent and cross-party inquiry, so that this government can no longer try and pull the wool over people’s eyes.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader and first minister, has denounced a small group of nationalists who staged a border protest against English visitors on the A1 at the weekend, some with SNP banners.The demonstration was condemned by Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, and the Scottish parliament’s most senior minority ethnic MSP, as “horrible, reprehensible and vile” after footage emerged of them shouting “stay the fuck out” and “plague carriers” at caravans and camper vans driving north.Sturgeon was asked whether the SNP, run by her husband, Peter Murrell, would check whether the protesters were party members and investigate. She replied:But I can’t be clearer than I have been: the SNP is an open, welcoming party Scotland is an open and welcoming country and that protest is not something I condone or endorse in any way, shape or form.Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, said on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Politics programme that type of protest would put off visitors, which Scotland’s tourist industry badly needed to attract. “We need people to come safely to Scotland to visit and to stay here on holiday and we should be encouraging that, not putting people off,” he said.The demonstration, which follows reports of a similar instance on a bridge over the A30 as it entered Cornwall, where an image on social media purported to show three people standing on a bridge over the A30 holding a sign that read: “Turn around and fuck off.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296782.1593965279!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert student told he is not eligible for predicted grade","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFinn Robertson (17), from Dungarvan, Co Waterford, has been told he will not receive an estimated grade for higher-level politics as he was self-taught in the subject and did not have a tutor. Photograph: Patrick BrowneA Co Waterford Leaving Cert student has been told he is not eligible for predicted grades for one of the subjects he studied because he was self-taught and did not have a tutor.Finn Robertson (17), from Dungarvan, studied five subjects in school and taught himself higher-level business and higher-level politics because the two subjects were not available at his school.He will receive a predicted grade for business because he attended grinds in January and February, but he has been told he will not receive an estimated grade for politics as he had not begun private tuition for the subject.In an email to his mother Alex Robertson, his school, Dungarvan CBS, said it “has to be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to them to stand over the estimated mark being provided”.“Unfortunately, the fact that Finn has sat the pre exam is not sufficient evidence to base an estimated mark in the subject Politics \u0026amp Society. The student’s learning has to have been guided by and overseen by a suitable tutor,” the email said.Ms Robertson described the decision as unfair because her son sat the mock exam earlier in the year, which she says was marked by an external examiner.“The Government has catered for kids doing full-time school, they’ve catered for homeschoolers, they’ve catered for kids getting grinds, they’ve catered for kids in full-time school taking additional subjects, but Finn falls into no category. His two subjects are not additional, they’re part of the standard seven,’ she said.Points for collegeThe student said being ineligible for a predicted grade in politics means he will not have enough points for college this year as he is taking ordinary-level maths. He had hoped to study politics and journalism at the University of Limerick.“It has really taken a drag on my self-confidence. Sitting the exams at a later date is something I will have to consider but it really isn’t something I want because it will mean I can’t go to college this year,” he said.Dungarvan CBS said all guidelines had been adhered to when administering calculated grades. A departmental spokesman said: “For the system to be operated with integrity, and fairness to all students, there must be credible, satisfactory evidence from an appropriate source, on which an estimated percentage mark can be based.“However, it is the case that, despite every effort being made by schools and the calculated grades executive office, it will not be possible to provide a calculated grade for every student in every subject. Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so.”The student says he intends to protest outside the Dáil on Monday, July 13th, in a bid to get the attention of policy-makers if the situation is not resolved."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Climate crisis and bioersity loss should be in one department \u0026ndash environment groupsProtestors scaling up action because Programme for Government not radical enough"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Gaillot et GrayPA WireIreland can eliminate Covid-19 over the course of the summer but repeatedly imposing, lifting and reimposing restrictions is a dangerous gamble, according to an Irish expert in infectious diseases.Prof Gerry Killeen said that it would only require a modest amount of additional effort to eliminate Covid-19 from Ireland over the coming months but failure to continue with strict restrictions could prove costly in the long term.He warned that complete elimination of Covid-19 could only be achieved by preventing reintroduction from outside the country which would require a rigorous isolation programme for anyone coming here.“The quiet tail of a fading epidemic may be just as dangerous as the silent onset,” said Prof Killeen who works at the Environmental Research Institute at University College Cork. Prof Killeen, who has worked in Tanzania and Kenya combating malaria as well as Zika and Dengue viruses, has conducted modelling analyses on how Covid-19 spreads and he is in no doubt about the risk it still poses.He said that as Ireland gradually begins to emerge from lockdown, it should look to countries with ambitious national strategies to crush the curve of their Covid-19 epidemics, such as China, Korea, Japan and Australia. “With their approaches to eliminating the virus with sustained and uninterrupted restrictions, their timelines to that exit point are about three months and New Zealand is already there,” he said.“Countries like Ireland, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, where daily incidence rates have been slowly falling, may well have achieved 80 per cent suppression of transmission.“Their epidemics could slowly fizzle away if current measures were maintained, so why would these countries not build upon their successes by pushing even just a little further past this crucial tipping point? “Faster progress towards elimination would obviously be better and these timelines could be shortened if we were to push ahead now with even more stringent and effective restrictions.”Prof Killeen, who has published his analysis in the journals, Infectious Disease Modelling and the European Journal of Epidemiology, has predicted Ireland’s recent rates of Covid-19 reduction could lead to zero cases over the summer.However, he has warned that, on the other hand, repeatedly imposing, lifting and reimposing restrictions until the epidemic hopefully burns itself out, through herd immunity, could see it lingering at great cost for many years.“It’s likely Covid-19 could establish itself as a permanent disease with unpredictable waves every few years,” said Prof Killeen, adding failure to completely eliminate the virus now risks greater long-term economic damage.“On the economic front, incomplete suppression of the epidemic means extending the damage over years rather than months, asking business to spend more time, operating under restrictions that push them into the red.”“However, such a bold choice would require a dramatic rethink of our national strategy, broad support from the public at large, and co-operation with our trading partners across Europe and the rest of the world.” Stark consequencesProf Killeen said that it was essential for politicians, health professionals, journalists and the general public that as many people as possible understand the stark consequences of the choices that lie ahead for Ireland.“Eliminating the virus within months would require only a modest amount of additional effort, compared to merely suppressing the epidemic and allowing it to persist for years, decades or even indefinitely,” he said.“Unfortunately, once we have eliminated the virus and can completely relax domestic restrictions, even the slightest easing of travel or importation controls could cause a rebound.”Prof Killeen said that the complete elimination of Covid-19 from Ireland can only be maintained by preventing its reintroduction from outside the country which means more rigorous controls on those coming to Ireland from abroad. “That means isolation of all incoming travellers, except those coming from countries that may be certified as free of local transmission by the World Health Organisation in the future,” he said.Failure to introduce rigorous isolation measures for people coming from countries that have not been certified free of local transmission by the WHO was “essentially identical to doing nothing in the first place,” he said.Prof Killeen said it was vital that both citizens and governments, who are considering relaxing unpopular lockdown restrictions, instead embrace intensified containment, elimination and exclusion efforts. “Unless we all respond constructively to the recent WHO appeal for genuine national unity and global solidarity, it appears unlikely that we can collectively defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Evan Davis fell while running out of a

and former leading IRA figure Bobby Storey at Milltown Cemetery in west Belfast. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireBelfast City Council has apologised to eight families who were not allowed to attend the cremation of their loved ones on the same day 30 people were present at the cremation of the former IRA member Bobby Storey. The council said it was an “error of judgement” and it was in the process of contacting the families affected. “We are deeply sorry for how this error will have affected them and any hurt and distress caused,” it said in a statement on Monday. Changes to the coronavirus regulations, which came into effect at 11pm on June 29th, relaxed the restriction on the numbers allowed to gather outdoors from 10 to 30 people. The City of Belfast Crematorium, which is located in Roselawn Cemetery and is operated by Belfast City Council, had been closed to mourners since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Up to 10 people were allowed to attend burials, but nobody could be present at a service after a cremation. The change in the regulations meant up to 30 people could be present at an outdoor committal service following the cremation of a loved one. In its statement, the council said it had been informed about the change in the regulations on Monday afternoon, enabling it to start communications with funeral directors. “This is normal practice,” the council said. “This was a rapidly changing environment as has been the case during the response to Covid-19, as rules change frequently.” The council said an “operational decision was made that for cremations the new procedures would apply from the cremation of Bobby Storey on the afternoon of Tuesday June 30th, onwards.” ServicesThis meant that Mr Storey’s was the only one of the nine cremation services which took place at Roselawn on June 29th which had mourners in attendance. However, of the four burial services which took place in Roselawn on Tuesday, all had up to 30 people present. A motion is to come before the North’s Assembly this week calling on the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, and the finance minister, Conor Murphy, to apologise for attending Mr Storey’s funeral. They were among a number of senior Sinn Féin figures, including the party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, who attended the funeral in west Belfast on June 30th. Ms O’Neill faced calls to resign following the funeral, which appeared to breach both social distancing guidelines and the coronavirus regulations in a number of respects, including the limit on the number of people allowed inside the church for Requiem Mass. The motion, which could be debated as early as Tuesday, has been signed by the other four parties in the Northern Executive and expresses their disappointment that ministers breached public health guidance. The first minister, Arlene Foster, told BBC Radio Ulster that “people are understandably very angry, people are frustrated, they’re deeply disappointed by recent events, and it’s important that the Assembly is able to recognise that anger and frustration even if Sinn Féin isn’t prepared to recognise that. “I think it will send a clear signal that there cannot be a toleration of double standards,” she said. SorryLast week Ms O’Neill said on Friday that she was sorry for any additional hurt her presence had caused to grieving families, but she was “confident I can stand over the fact that I worked within the guidelines, that I worked within the regulations in terms of attending a Requiem Mass, which was allowed, and also to walk in a funeral cortege of up to 30 people.” This has been rejected by the other four parties in the Northern Executive – the DUP, SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance – with the first minister, Arlene Foster, saying that the apology “falls short” and the other party leaders were “very clear that the deputy first minister had broken the guidance and the regulations.” Belfast City Council previously admitted there were no further cremations or burials at Roselawn on June 30th, and said an “operational decision” had been made to “to hold the last three cremation slots of the day. “This decision was made in order to ensure that there were no other cremations later that day – in order to protect the privacy of other members of the public and their cremation services. “Belfast City Council did not know whether to anticipate high numbers or otherwise and therefore planned for all instances. This would be normal practice in the event of a high profile cremation. “There is currently no waiting list at Roselawn Crematorium and no cremations were cancelled. “Operational decisions like these, made by Belfast City Council are made impartially in what is often a complex and difficult political environment,” the council said.ClaimsHowever in response to claims that a number of council staff were sent home and Sinn Féin marshals were instead on the site, the council said stewards “appointed by the family” were present to ensure only those permitted were present, which it said was “no different to what would normally be the case in a high profile cremation or one that would potentially attract high numbers of people or media.” The council said 15 members of staff remained present, but some non-cremation staff did go home early to avoid staff being photographed, “as has happened with other high profile funerals or sensitive cremations in the past” and - given that the council did not know how many people might be present – to allow staff who did not need to be present to leave “before potential volumes of traffic and media arrived.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297383.1594041177!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet analysis 26 of new minister positions allocated to women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins presents the new Ministers with their seals of office.

The last government had 11 female TDs, seven of whom held Cabinet positions.The percentage of women appointed to senior Cabinet roles remains the same as the previous government at 27 per cent, however the percentage of women holding junior ministerial roles has increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. There is one additional Minister of State role in the current Cabinet bringing the number of Cabinet members to 35.As two of the women’s positions are super junior roles, Ms Hackett and Fine Gael’s Hildegarde Naughton do not have a Cabinet vote.Ages The new Cabinet is younger than the outgoing Cabinet and has no members currently over 60. An analysis of the former cabinet’s age in June compared to the current Cabinet’s shows the average age is 45.6 years old, 7.1 years younger than the previous cabinet’s average age of 52.7 years. While the oldest member of the last cabinet, the then minister for transport Shane Ross, was 70, the oldest member of the new Cabinet is Taoiseach Micheál Martin who is 59, and will turn 60 in August.The last cabinet had 35 per cent of its minsters over the age of 60, however over half (57 per cent) of the current Cabinet is aged between 40-59 while almost one fifth (17 per cent) are under the age of 40, compared to 12 per cent of the previous cabinet.Geographical spread As per the previous cabinet, the majority of Ministers (63 per cent) are from the Leinster region with 11 of the 35 posts awarded to those from the capital. Seven of Dublin’s 11 constituencies are now represented by a Cabinet member and Dublin West has the highest number of ministerial posts in Dublin with Tánaiste and Minster for Jobs Leo Varadkar (FG), Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Roderick O’Gorman (GP) and Minister of State for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance Jack Chambers (FF) all from the constituency.Cork South-Central is the only other constituency to have three TDs in the Cabinet and is represented by Mr Martin, his party colleague Michael McGrath as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Fine Gael’s Simon Coveney who is continuing as Minister for Foreign Affairs.Occupations While a number of Cabinet members such as Mr Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan have been TDs for decades, taking into account all Cabinet members’ occupations prior to entering the Dáil, almost a fifth of the Cabinet (17 per cent) are from a business background 14 per cent were involved in education while accounting, agriculture and finance (11 per cent respectively) are also among the main sectors some of the ministers have worked in.Those who have direct work experience with their portfolio include secondary school teacher Norma Foley (FF) who is Minister for Education farmer Martin Heydon (FG) as Minister of State for Farm Safety at the Department of Agriculture and his department colleague Ms Hackett, an organic farmer and Super Junior Minister of State for Land Use and Bioersity."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297456.1594046622!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet meets to discuss pubs travel restrictions and covid 19 tracing app","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dublin city centre on Saturday evening as lockdown restrictions start to ease.

Mr Cowen was disqualified from driving for three months after he pleaded guilty to drink driving on his way home from the All-Ireland football final.“I didn’t know it (about Mr Cowen’s drink driving conviction), I wasn’t aware and he certainly didn’t make me aware at the time – it seems from his perspective, he was very ashamed of it and he’s said that,” the Taoiseach said on Monday. “He’s acknowledged that he didn’t say it to me or to colleagues because he was deeply ashamed and embarrassed at the fact that incident occurred back in 2016 and it was a terrible lapse of judgement on his part.“He’s made a full apology and justice was meted out to him in accordance with the law at the time,” said Mr Martin, adding he didn’t know why Mr Cowen was driving on a provisional licence at the time at the age of 49. It is understood Mr Cowen has made contact with the office of the Ceann Comhairle to arrange speaking time. The Dáil’s business committee is to meet on Monday afternoon to consider the request.Mr Cowen said over the weekend: “Maybe I should have stood up in the Dáil, and led from the front and acknowledged my stupid mistake.“I was not trying to keep it secret, I was trying to get on with my job.”Seperately, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said that Mr Cowen was wrong to have been drink-driving but added she has accepted his apology.Ms McEntee, who was visiting Slane Garda station in Co Meath where she held a meeting with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, said the incident “shouldn’t have happened”. FocusShe added that the focus of the new Government should be on road victims and their families. “What happened was wrong. It shouldn’t have happened and I think the minister has acknowledged what he did was wrong and I think what’s important at the time is that the law was applied,” Ms McEntee added. “Obviously what was given out to the minister, he accepted it and took that as he should have. “I think we need to focus on victims, those who have lost family members due to drink-driving, making sure that we have measures in place that protect people, that make our roads as safe as possible. “Obviously there was a huge amount of changes implemented in the last government and we want to continue to implement them. “I don’t agree with what happened, he has apologised, I accept that and I think it’s important that the law was applied.” "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Global wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4297367.1594039576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus india s 700 000 cases now third highest in world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective masks travel on a bus in Mumbai, India, on Monday.

Photograph: APCroatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic has started talks to secure a parliamentary majority for a new government led by his conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) after celebrating its comprehensive election victory.With nearly all votes counted from Sunday’s ballot, the ruling HDZ had secured 66 of the 151 seats in Croatia’s parliament, well clear of the Restart alliance led by the Social Democrats (SDP) with 41 seats, and the nationalist Homeland Movement with 16.Polls had predicted a much tighter race, and analysts said the result vindicated Mr Plenkovic’s decision to call an election in the wake of Croatia’s successful handling of its initial coronavirus outbreak and its move to reopen to foreign holidaymakers last month to bring in vital revenue.At the same time, voters did not heed opposition attempts to blame the HDZ for a resurgence in coronavirus cases in the last fortnight, which has deepened fears for the economy of the tourism-reliant Adriatic state.National minoritiesMr Plenkovic held talks on Monday with representatives of two small liberal parties that each claimed one seat, and deputies representing the country’s national minorities, which have an allocation of eight seats.“They give clear support to the new parliamentary majority and the HDZ government that will be led by Andrej Plenkovic,” said government spokesman Marko Milic. An agreement with those deputies would give Mr Plenkovic a working majority of 76 seats and avoid the need for any deal with folk singer Miroslav Skoro’s populist, nationalist Homeland Movement, which may appeal to far-right leaning elements of the HDZ but would alarm liberals at home and abroad. “We’ve had a difficult term full of challenges, and the challenges ahead of us are even greater,” Mr Plenkovic (50) said of the HDZ’s victory. “Support like this is a huge obligation and we will be mindful of it. Croatia needs solutions for the economy and the challenges in the public health sector.”Von der LeyenDavor Bernardic resigned as SDP leader in response to the Restart alliance’s underwhelming performance.The European Commission has expressed regret at how its president, Ursula von der Leyen, appeared in a campaign video for the HDZ.The ex-German defence minister is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, which like the HDZ belongs to the European People’s Party.

Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 may not have originated china elsewhere emerged asia","story":"Coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were right for it to thrive rather than starting in China, an Oxford University expert believes.Dr Tom Jefferson, senior associate tutor at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), at Oxford and a visiting professor at Newcastle University,  argues there is growing evidence that the virus was elsewhere before it emerged in Asia.Last week, Spanish virologists announced that they had found traces of the disease in samples of waste water collected in March 2019, nine months before coronavirus was seen in China.Italian scientists have also found evidence of coronavirus in sewage samples in Milan and Turin in mid-December, many weeks before the first case was detected, while experts have found evidence of traces in Brazil in November.Dr Jefferson believes many viruses lie dormant throughout the globe and emerge when conditions are favourable, which also means they can vanish as quickly as they arrive.Where did Sars 1 go? It\u0027s just disappeared, he said. So we have to think about these things. We need to start researching the ecology of the virus, understanding how it originates and mutates.I think the virus was already here – here meaning everywhere. We may be seeing a dormant virus that has been activated by environmental conditions. There was a case in the Falkland Islands in early February. Now where did that come from? There was a cruise ship that went from South Georgia to Buenos Aires, and the passengers were screened and then on day eight, when they started sailing towards the Weddell Sea, they got the first case. Was it in prepared food that was defrosted and activated? Strange things like this happened with Spanish Flu. In 1918, around 30 per cent of the population of Western Samoa died of Spanish Flu, and they hadn\u0027t had any communication with the outside world.The explanation for this could only be that these agents don\u0027t come or go anywhere. They are always here and something ignites them, maybe human density or environmental conditions, and this is what we should be looking for.Dr Jefferson believes the virus may be transmitted through the sewage system or shared toilet facilities, not just through droplets expelled by talking, coughing and sneezing.Writing in The , Dr Jefferson and Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the CEBM, call for an in-depth investigation similar to that carried out by John Snow in 1854 to show that cholera was spreading in London from an infected well in Soho.Exploring why so many outbreaks happen at food factories and meat-packing plants could uncover major new transmission routes, they believe. It may be shared toilet facilities, coupled with cool conditions, that allow the virus to thrive.We\u0027re doing a living review, extracting environmental conditions, the ecology of these viruses which has been grossly understudied, said Dr Jefferson.There is quite a lot of evidence that huge amounts of the virus were in sewage all over the place, and an increasing amount of evidence there is faecal transmission. There is a high concentration where sewage is four degrees, which is the ideal temperature for it to be stabled and presumably activated. And meat-packing plants are often at four degrees.These meat-packing clusters and isolated outbreaks don\u0027t fit with respiratory theory, they fit with people who haven\u0027t washed their hands properly. These outbreaks need to be investigated properly with people on the ground one by one.

It\u0027s vital that the Government provides clarity to consumers who are booking, and provides just one list that is accurate and up to date in terms of where we can actually access.Emma Coulthurst, consumer advocate for price comparison site TravelSupermarket, said: The Government\u0027s latest information released late on Friday on where UK citizens can holiday this summer has the potential to confuse people and see them unwittingly book holidays which, due to restrictions imposed by the destination country, they might not be able to take.There are some countries on the UK Government FCO and DfT lists which are refusing UK citizens entry or imposing strict entry requirements, which either completely prevent holidays or make them extremely difficult or more costly.Our reporter Lottie Gross has Palma de Mallorca virtually to herself, and Pedro Homar from the local tourist board says the general feeling in Mallorca is that they want tourists – even from the worst affected country in Europe.Heidi Fuller-Love is staying at the Stella Island Resort, one of the first hotels to reopen in Crete. She writes:The atmosphere was subdued on my first night’s stay, with only 10 rooms occupied out of 235. By the second night that rose to 50, and staff seemed more at ease wearing their hot and uncomfortable plexiglass masks, whilst guests also seemed more relaxed, many shedding their PPE soon after arriving from the airport. With so many pools, the sound of running water, along with birdsong and the gentle flutter of palm fronds, was intensely soothing – it really was like being on an island sealed off from the outside world. Post Covid-19, however, there was less of the usual party vibe in this adults-only resort – more a sense that guests were exhausted: just glad to arrive, soak up the sun and forget the stress of lockdown.Read the full story.Our correspondent Lottie Gross flew to Mallorca on Saturday, becoming one of the first UK travellers to visit after the easing of FCO travel advice.

Visitors to Amsterdam will also find that boat trips along its iconic canals have restarted. Tourists take a boat ride in AmsterdamHazel Plush was among the first tourists to return to Legoland on Saturday. She writes:With signs reminding visitors about social distancing, hand sanitizing stations everywhere, and masks mandatory on many of the rides, it was a reassuringly well-managed experience. And, through their face shields and masks, the staff were clearly over the moon to be back: “I felt really emotional when we opened the gates this morning,” said one park employee. “We’ve spent months preparing for this moment – it was just fantastic to see families here again.” On all rides, selected areas were cordoned off to maintain social distancing – with staff swooping in to clean the cabs as soon as each group left. Over in Miniland, with its famous Lego-built world icons, there’s a new addition: a Key Worker ‘Thank You’, which features lockdown heroes galore.

He says: Forty-five minutes from Paris now as the Eurostar hurtles across the countryside. Today is a great day to visit, coinciding with the reopening of the Louvre. Surely there will not be the usual summertime crowds making a beeline for the Mona Lisa?With Galicia and Catalonia reimposing restrictions, travellers heading to Europe may be nervous about the risk of new Covid-19 outbreaks spoiling their summer holiday. Nick Trend, our consumer expert, says: This is probably the biggest practical risk faced by holidaymakers this summer. You may have a holiday booked, but be unable to travel because of a new local, or national, lockdown in response to a new outbreak of the virus. Or, having once relaxed the quarantine rules and FCO advice against travel to some countries, the Government might reimpose the restrictions.Tour operators will normally cancel holidays in such cases and you should get a refund. But there may be some grey areas which complicate matters. Some are introducing more flexibility in their bookings. BA Holidays, for example, says that if you book a holiday with them before August 31, 2020, for travel up to April 30, 2021, you can amend your booking for free (paying any difference in price) or cancel it and get a voucher for travel up until April 30, 2022. It’s worth looking out for that kind of deal if you are booking a holiday in the short term to give you more protection against uncertainty.Read the full article.Mark Stratton is en route to Paris, and he isn\u0027t the only one.

Best of all he should abolish stamp duty altogether, but if he doesn’t feel able to do that he should at least reduce it to a level at which it is no longer dissuading us from moving home.Stamp duty is a tax on mobility which whacks some people over and over again with huge bills – while others, no less wealthy, pay not a penny. If you are like me, and spend over 20 years in the same house, you don’t pay a thing. If, on the other hand, you have a growing family or you need to move around the country for your work, you keep having to shell out tens of thousands of pounds to the government. Upsize to a £500,000 home – which will hardly buy you a mansion anywhere, and will scarcely buy you a one bedroom flat in central London – and you will owe £15,000. If you buy before you have sold your existing home, the bill will be £30,000. That is higher than the median annual income for a UK household. If you sell your old home within three years you can get half of it refunded, but there is no guarantee of that in a slow housing market.As a form of punishment, stamp duty works wonders. Fancy buying a £2 million home – more than most can afford but hardly a billionaire’s house? That will be £153,750 in stamp duty, thanks very much. Unless, that is, you own another property in which case it will be £213,750. There will be some people, of course, who will always want to tax the rich until the pips squeak. But it rather depends on what you think a tax should be for: purely to place a burden on rich people – or actually to raise some revenue for public services. Stamp duty has become a living demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action. When Gordon Brown first started jacking up rates in the early 2000s, he horribly distorted the property market – making it virtually impossible to sell a home for between £250,000 and £300,000, owing to the jump in stamp duty. But he did, nevertheless, succeed in raising more revenue overall. George Osborne, too, got away with his initial rises in stamp duty, and receipts increased. Then, finally, in 2014, he got too greedy, introducing a 12 per cent rate at the upper end of the market and an extra three per cent levy on second homes.   The result was a plunge in property sales at the upper end of the market. A lost sale means no revenue from stamp duty at all. Last year, income from stamp duty on residential property sales in England fell by six per cent. On sales of second homes the fall was nine per cent. It isn’t just the prime market where stamp duty has hit sales. Overall, property transactions (even before the Covid-19 crisis) were running at only two thirds the level they were throughout much of the 2000s. A study by the Economic and Social Research Council concluded that for every two per cent rise in stamp duty, transactions are reduced by 40 per cent.Stamp duty aside, the shrunken estate agency sector is paying less tax. There is a cost from inefficient use of housing – from people who want to downsize but who are put off by the stamp duty bill. There is an extra burden on roads and public transport – as people, dissuaded from moving home to be closer to a new job, end up commuting long distances. There is an economic cost, too, from people choosing not to take up jobs in another part of the country because the stamp duty bill negates a rise in salary.      Moving home is not an antisocial act which warrants being discouraged, like landfill or burning dirty fuels, through punitive taxation.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Ten in the morning on the first day of pubs reopening since lockdown and in Sheffield’s most central Wetherspoon pub Connor Bowling and his two mates are already three pints deep, Full English full and considering ordering a round of Jagermeisters.“It’s early, but why not?” the 23-year-old gas engineer says. “It’s been a long three months.”Thus began the much-anticipated day on which, to paraphrase the prime minister, English people regained their ancient unalienable right to go out and drink. Fourth July: when the country’s pubs and bars reopened for the first time following 15 weeks and one day of coronavirus lockdown when the government told us: get to the boozer – the economy needs you.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat had Bowling and his pals got planned in order to do their duty? “No plans,” he said, sat in The Sheffield Water Works Company. “Other than it getting messy.”Twelve hours later, with the night now in full swing, it seemed that, while plenty had similar aspirations, the weekend would not, in fact, be the booze-apocalypse many had feared.Sheffield was Saturday night busy – but only just. Roughly half of all pubs were shut – a figure in line with national reports – and few of those open had queues outside, despite social distancing rules meaning they were only able to cater for about 70 per cent normal capacity. Certainly, the lines did not compare to those which formed outside reopened barbers and hair salons in the morning and afternoon.Three pints deep at 10am as pub drinkers toast end to lockdown“I wonder what that says about people?” pondered 19-year-old Ria Hinchliffe in The Wick At Both Ends pub. “I’m having mine done on Tuesday.”A\u0026ampE figures and arrest numbers will come in due course. But on the streets and in the bars of this South Yorkshire city, this did not feel like the mass release of energy many had predicted. If social distancing wasn’t exactly being observed everywhere, nor perhaps was it being smashed to quite the extent one might expect following a 106 day shut down. Similar scenes were experienced in towns and cities across England, including Manchester and Newcastle, reports suggested.“People have been behaving really well, actually,” said Amy Locke, a bar manager at the city’s Forum bar. “Once you’re at a table, you’re not supposed to get up and mix with other people and we’ve had to ask a few people to stop doing that. I’ve felt a bit like a school teacher telling people to sit down but I think people understand why.”Among the changes from a pre-Covid world were hand-sanitiser on doors, Perspex screens on counters, more table service and music turned right down. Among the similarities were the odd lad still having an indiscrete wee in the odd doorway.“It’s actually quite civilised, isn’t it?” said Idony Lee – talking about the table service not the doorway misuse. “It reminds me of how people drink on the continent.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’d rather know I’d enjoyed myself than stayed sat at home afraid of a virus.”She may have been 52 years younger but 19-year-old project coordinator Chloe Pownall, drinking in The Wick At Both Ends, felt something similar.“What are we going to do?” she asked. “Just stay in forever? Especially because I’m quite young, so I just think it’s worth the risk.”She was on a pint of Carling. How did it taste from the tap? “So, so good,” she said. “People look down at you for being a girl drinking pints. Couldn’t care less.”In London, earlier in the day, there had been a similar situation.John, a 66-year-old who lives in Putney and was enjoying a pint with a newspaper in the JJ Moon pub in Tooting Broadway, said: “This tastes a lot better out of a glass than it does out of a tin, that I can tell you.”While he said that the return to pubs pales in comparison with seeing his grandchildren after three months of shielding, he agreed that the renewed sense of community would offer a boost after the hardships of lockdown.“At the moment, where this pub’s concerned, it seems to be working out fine, but you can’t judge one pub by all pubs,” he said. “The way it is in here now, it’s quite modern. It’s not too hectic either. I’m quite happy with it.”Of whether pre-booking systems could affect the spontaneity of going for a drink, he added: “Possibly, it all depends how busy it is. Saturday night, a lot of people, in the event of a football match where it’s screened in certain pubs, that could take its toll. You’ll probably have a line-up about half a mile down the road waiting to get in to see the match.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Oliver Dowden has admitted it will be challenging to reopen theatres in time for the Christmas pantomime season due the “huge transmission risks” of the events.The culture secretary said the government will “shortly” be publishing guidance for venues, but warned the point at which they can perform without social distancing is “someway off”.His remarks come after the Treasury unveiled a £1.5 billion lifeline for theatres, independent cinemas and other arts organisations to help them stay in businesses while the coronavirus pandemic forces them to remain closed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoris Johnson said the rescue package for the sector would help safeguard the arts for “future generations”, adding it will ensure “arts groups and venues across the UK can stay afloat and support their staff whilst their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.”Organisations that will be prioritised are understood to include the so-called “crown jewels” of the British arts, culture and heritage industries and those with special local or regional significance, as ministers proceed with their “levelling up” agenda. But pressed on when theatres will be able to reopen, Mr Dowden told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In relation to theatres, what we’ve said is that they can rehearse or perform behind closed doors. I hope shortly we will be publishing guidance for them to be able to perform outside and then for them to be able with social distancing. “I have to say, the point at which they can perform without social distancing is someway off. If you think about most of our theatres – they are all from Victorian theatres – people are packed in close together.”Pressed on whether the Christmas pantomime season would be possible, he added: “Well I would love us to get to the point where we could have Christmas pantos back.Arts industry to receive £1.5bn lifeline, government announces“The challenges are – first of all you’ve got from granny to grandchild, you’ve got kids shouting and screaming ‘He’s behind you’ or the other stuff we love doing, it’s highly interactive, there is usually bubble soap being chucked around or whatever else. All of those represent huge transmission risks so it is at the very difficult end of it. I want to be realistic about it, if we can do it we will, but it looks challenging. Mr Dowden added that he is working with Public Health England to see if the risks can be mitigated, but added on BBC Breakfast he wanted to “be realistic about the challenges of getting us back to that point any time soon.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Fernando Medina estimated that more than a third of properties in the centre of the city are currently taken up by holiday lettings. Writing in The Independent, Mr Medina said tourist rentals had pushed up property prices in recent years and driven out essential workers and their families.

The mayor cited examples of other cities that were also implementing bold strategies to change their urban spaces for the better.  He wrote: From Melbourne to Paris, the tide is turning against urban sprawl and back to revitalised city centres where residents can reach key services, like doctors, schools and shops all within a 20-minute walk.He added: With many more people likely to be permanently working from home, it makes sense for more Lisboetas to swap the suburbs for the city where they can easily access public transport, services and take advantage of festivals and concerts.After Covid-19, Lisbon is turning Airbnb rentals into key worker homesThe impact of rental platforms such as Airbnb has come under growing scutiny in cities around the world. Earlier this year, the French government announced its plan to create a state-run booking website in an attempt to rival websites such as Airbnb and Booking as the county tries to revive its tourism sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

I would be naive to say a no trade deal isnt possible.#But it would be such an act of self-harm and such a failure of politics, I believe politicians and governments will find a way of getting a deal.#Michel Barnier will travel to London today with a small group of experts for face-to-face talks with David Frost and his team.Both chief negotiators are said to be privately progressing towards a #landing zone# that respects both sides red lines.The PMs spokesman said: #This will be a chance to have some further discussions and see what progress might be made.#We continue to make the point that we are seeking an FTA based on precedent and of the kind which the EU has agreed with other friendly countries.#We’re not looking for anything special, bespoke, or unique.#We’ve also been consistently clear we can’t agree to a set of novel and unbalanced proposals that bind the UK to EU law or standards.#Dominic Raab has outlined plans for a post-Brexit strategy to sanction countries abusing human rights. Speaking in the Commons this afternoon, the Foreign Secretary said: #From today, the UK will have new powers to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the UK, channelling money through our banks and profiting from our economy.#This is a clear example of how the UK will help to lead the world in standing up for human rights.#We will not let those who seek to inflict pain and destroy the lives of innocent victims benefit from what the UK has to offer.#The UKs post-Brexit, #autonomous sanctions# regime is set to be brought into force on Monday.The Foreign Office says it will target #the worlds worst human rights violators and abusers, and those complicit in their crimes#.The department said it will be the first time that the UK has sanctioned people or entities for human rights violations and abuses under a UK-only regime, and will allow the UK #to work independently with allies such as the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union#.An FCO spokesperson said: #The regime will allow the UK to target iniduals and organisations around the world unlike conventional geographic sanctions regime, which only target a country.#Future targets of the regime may include those who commit unlawful killings perpetrated against journalists and media workers, or activity motivated on the grounds of religion or belief.#Britain wants to seethere is a chance for progress in talks with the EU this week after last weeks round of Brexit negotiations ended a day early with signicant dferences between the two sides.# Frost#has set out #that while the talks continue to be constructive there are still signicant dferences between us. #It is a chance to have some further discussions to see what progress might be made,# the spokesman said.The European Union will take decisive action against the United Statesit is unwilling to settle a long-running row over aircraft subsidies, Europes trade commissioner said on Monday.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince. He is a national embarrassment. When Princess Diana orced from Charles, she was immediately stripped of her HRH status yet the Prince of Sleaze keeps his. He should have his taken away without any further delay. Let him be Andrew Inverness, since he likes that name.The victims of Epstein will be scarred for le. If he has a scrap of decency left inside him, he will travel to the United States and tell the FBI all he knows.This is one trip for Air Miles Andy that the taxpayer would be prepared to pay for - especiallyit is a one-way ticket.       Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was the first to use it on a non-domestic animal.”Over the past  years, the dentist has operated on ­elephants, leopards and lions at London Zoo.And dental tools and ­equipment made for humans just won’t cut it.Dr Kertesz said: “An ­elephant’s molar is the size of a breeze block.”KEEPERS also make sure the animals have lots of fun to keep them stimulated.To give the zoo’s Asiatic lions the experience of hunting for prey, specialist fund management company Liontrust donated a giant seesaw for them to play on last year.They jump on the seesaw to reach hunks of meat to mimic a wildebeest hunting experience in the wild.But under lockdown, some of the animals have been missing their human visitors.The pygmy goats are used to being petted and were left confused by the lack of attention.To keep them happy, keepers have been taking it in turns to give the goats massages and cuddles.Keeper Cha Reid said: “They love a good ear scratch or belly rub. A daily massage was exactly what they wanted.”ANIMALS live much longer in captivity thanks to veterinary care and a lack of predators, and London Zoo has a growing elderly animal population.Senior primate keeper Jacob Winfield, , threw a th birthday party for gibbon Jimmy with a cake made from monkey-friendly sweet potato and a gt of a new tyre swing.Jacob said: “We tend to do something for all of our animals for their birthday. But when we realised it was Jimmy’s th we got a bit more excited than normal.”The gibbon arrived at London Zoo in  after being cruelly kept as a pet.Jacob said: “He’s very spritely. He’s probably the best old animal we have at the zoo in terms of fitness.“He’s very healthy and he’s got nothing wrong with him.”LONDON Zoo runs conservation projects all over the world and protects everything from seahorses in the Thames to rhinos in Nepal. The zoo prioritises breeding programmes for animals such as endangered okapis, who ­number only a few thousand in the wild.Not much is known about the shy zebra-like animals who live in the dense forests of the Congo and were only discovered in .Keeper Megan Harber, , trained an okapi to stand still for an ultrasound.Oni the okapi is one year into her -month pregnancy and she is given ultrasounds every two weeks.Megan said: “To get an ultrasound is quite dficult. You have to put the contact jelly on — which she loves to eat.

In , around  per cent of the population of Western Samoa died of Spanish Flu and they hadnt had any communication with the outside world.The explanation could only be that these agents dont come or go anywhere. They are always here and something ignites them, maybe human density or environmental conditions, and this is what we should look for.There is quite a lot of evidence of huge amounts of the virus in sewage all over the place, and an increasing amount of evidence there is faecal transmission.There is a high concentration where sewage is four degrees, which is the ideal temperature for it to be stabled and presumably activated. And meatpacking plants are often at four degrees.These outbreaks need to be investigated properly.It comes after China blamed Spain for the coronavirus pandemic - suggesting that the bug emerged in Europe and not Wuhan.Senior government health adviser Wang Guangfa referenced research in Barcelona which detected Covid- in a wastewater sample from March  to suggest any investigation into its origins should look at Spain.Next week, the World Health Organisation will start a scoping mission to China which aims to establish a  to trace the emergence of the killer virus which has now claimed more than , deaths globally.  Independent experts have slammed the research as flawed and contradictory to strong evidence suggesting the virus started in China in late .Director of the UCL Genetics Institute in London Professor Francois Balloux said: “The most plausible explanation is sample mix-up contamination.But officials from the communist regime, which has repeatedly tried to deflect blame, insisted any investigation into how and where the pandemic started should not be confined to the one country.Chief epidemiologist for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told state-tun Global Times: “Identying the source of the coronavirus must be based on negotiations and involve multiple countries.It does not matter which country the scientic identication work starts with, as long as it involves all related countries and is fairly conducted.Director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the WHO said: Knowing the source of the virus is very, very important. We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started.”The WHO team will see an animal health expert and an epidemiologist travel to China to “set up an international mission” to explore Covid-s origins.EcoHealth Alliance president Dr Peter Daszak told The : “Doing the science of this is hard, its expensive, it takes a long time. But its worth doing because then you can actually make intelligent decisions that will save lives in the future… and prevent another pandemic.”He added that tracing the virus will be dficult because China is increasingly hostile and resistant to global criticism.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.The search for how the pandemic started has centred around Wuhans Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which had links to many of the first reported cases.But Dr Daszak suspected the virus, which most likely originated in bats, was spreading for some time before reaching Wuhan through an extensive wildle trade that connects rural areas with bat caves to large cities.China has been widely criticised for its handling of coronavirus and the superpower has made repeated attempts since the outbreak to distance itself from blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While he didnt appear to own any slaves himself, he did trade slaves for his in-laws and opposing slavery was never at the top of his agenda.Hamilton was not a champion for the little guy, as the show portrays, according to Gordon-Reed.While many people are jumping on the Cancel Hamilton train, many others took to Twitter to defend Mirandas play - and to denounce the current obsession with doing away with any art that may be considered offensive.To those of you using #CancelHamilton, you need to learn to separate fact from fiction.

Bat did a poo, and hid a disease within it.When Man took the poo to turn it into bio-engineered weapons for fun, Man died in large numbers. Bat said: Thataposs for cutting down my trees.Manaposs money evaporated, his social systems trembled, and his clever brain went into overdrive making vaccines and excuses. Pig saw what happened, and wanted a bit of it. Pig coughed on Man, and Man grew terried. Pig said: Thataposs for sausages. Git.  Then Marmot said: Hang on. Man eats my kidneys raw as a folk remedy. I do not harm Man. I spend most of the year asleep in my burrow. Any longer up with this, I shall not put. And so Marmot infected Man with the Black Death, which last time out killed million people, sparked migrant massacres, and caused overnight economic and social collapse.Then Mosquito laughed. Silly mammals! he said. You are killing Man suddenly, and noticeably. In , he will hunt you to extinction. I have killed billions, but my reign of terror continues because I am too small for Man to eat. And the Vegetarian stepped forward, smiling, and righteous, and said: Verily, I have inherited the Earth, and shall be good and kind to all the meat within it. Mossies, on the other hand, can eat my zapper.  Boris Johnson tried to fix the problems by telling people to go on holiday with all the money they didnapost have.Prince Charles tried to fix it by telling people think about the planet, but did it in such a way he generated a carbon footprint bigger than the BFG, so no-one paid much attention.Donald Trump did not try to fix the problem at all, and he had the most success as it killed off a lot of the problem.The Vegetarian urged Man to stop eating meat, but Man said: Bacon. The Vegetarian urged Man to eat fake Bacon, but Man said: You realise this is an additive-ridden, sugar-and-fat-filled, articially-produced piece of mushroom fibre grown in factory farmed chicken poo, yes  Itaposs very water-intensive, and itaposs actually more environmentally-friendly to eat mosquitoes. Wait, can vegetarians eat mosquitoes And the Vegetarian cried, because she could not win.  Man looked around him, and was cross. Why do the things that serve me now try to kill me  he demanded. Then Fox stepped forward. Fox had been hunted for fun, not food, and had more reason than most to hate Man. But Fox took pity on Man, who was not particularly bright, and tried to explain.There is only one animal that serves you, and it is Dog, but some of you eat even him. These other animals share your planet, but not your respect, said Fox. Just like Man, they accept some will die, and that each of us consume the other in a never-ending cycle. They do not object to the principle of being eaten, for many of them eat each other. They object to harm being done, to being eaten when it is not necessary, to factory farming and cheap chickens and reformed ham. Truth be told, theyaposre particularly cross about the fake meat. Itaposs a bit like humans using sex robots: missing the point and devaluing it, all at the same time. Have you considered, you know, just being a bit nicer about things   Nicer  said Man. What is nicer  Fox sighed. It means kinder, and also accurate. For example, eat your meat, but not indiscriminately. Once or twice a week, from a good farmer who gave your dinner a happy le.Donapost tinker with bat viruses. Donapost treat marmots like penicillin. Maybe give some pencillin to the people of Ulaanbaatar, who appear to need it.

Southwark Crown Court heard the alleged victim, who was in her early thirties, was flattered when Elphicke -  at the time - had invited her to share a drink with him. He opened a bottle of £ wine and began asking her about her sexual interests, includingshe liked lace and leather, and saying he liked bondage and whips, jurors were told.

The Cabinet Minister dropped the biggest hint yet that three Fleet Solid Support vessels would be built in the UK, boosting jobs and industry. Speaking at Defence Questions in the Commons, he said: “British shipbuilding, British yards produce some of the best ships in the world and we should support them as best we can and make sure our Navy get some great British-made kit.”  Labour MP Kevan Jones, a former Defence Minister who chairs Parliamentaposs cross-party group for shipbuilding and ship repair, urged him to “bring forward the procurement of the Fleet Solid Support ships, because this would not only be increasing the capability of the Royal Navy, but also it would be a big boost to UK plc, including the supply chain in the North East of England,that deal was placed with a UK yard”.Revealing he had pushed Whitehall officials to speed-up the competition, Mr Wallace added: “I am keen that this gets underway as soon as possible – and indeed, have asked officials to bring it forward from their proposed date.” GMB union national officer Ross Murdoch said: The Secretary of State is making the right noises and now we need action.  Ministers have the power to guarantee that these ships are built in the UK, and some of our yards desperately need the work to keep their heads above water.  We call on the Government to bring forward this contract and award the order to UK yards to give the economy the shot in the arm it desperately needs. The vital vessels will resupply Royal Navy aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates with food, ammunition and explosives. For national security reasons, Royal Navy warships can only be built in the UK.  But because the supply ships will be part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, they are not classed as warships – meaning they could be built abroad. The competition for the contract was initially offered worldwide, with companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea shortlisted along with a UK consortium. The British team, backed by the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, included Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. But the prospect of building British naval ships abroad when the UK was leaving the EU and reasserting itself globally horried campaigners and triggered a split in government.  The tendering process was halted suddenly in November – raising hopes the terms could be reset to boost British firmsapos chances of winning the deal. The Mirror revealed in May how experts then believed the UK was favourite to win the contract. A Whitehall spending watchdog last month said a lack of Navy support vessels will hamper Britainaposs two new £.billion aircraft carriers. “The MoD has made slow progress developing three new support ships, which are crucial to Carrier Strike’s operation,” said the National Audit Office. “It has only one ship able to resupply the carriers with the supplies they need, such as ammunition and food.

But as some people are tested more than once, officials have in the past issued a figure for the number of iniduals tested as well. The government temporarily stopped publishing the figure in May, amid claims the number of iniduals tested was embarrassingly small - something Number  denied.

Today, Number  admitted theyaposd given up on that plan. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: DHSC will no longer publish the number of people tested daily anymore, and will instead publish the number of daily tests processed. This is because the daily people tested statistic only counts new people being tested. For example, someone who was tested in February, and then tested again this month, would be counted once. Considering hospital and care home staff will now be tested on a regular basis, we don’t think this statistic would be an accurate reflection of the amount of daily testing that is taking place. Test and trace statistics published weekly will include the number of people who have been tested.

Both share a political DNA worshipping the wealthy, hating regulations, disliking public services, shackling trade unions and bashing European neighbours. The unprecedented coronavirus crisis may have forced free-marketeer Johnson to become temporarily a socialist, adopting the job-saving furlough scheme. Labour and trade union leaders voiced support for an intervention as bold as Gordon Brown’s bank nationalisation because it was a Left-wing answer to a capitalist calamity. Yet winding it up in a few months, allowing dole queues to stretch to s not seen since Margaret Thatcher dumped -million on the scrapheap in her s carnage, would be Johnson’s tribute act to the callous lady. The PM stating the nation can’t afford a scheme costing upwards of £-billion during the emergency is looking at a problem from the wrong direction. Labour Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds has made a reasonable start in the post but she requires an iron fist in her velvet glove. Britain can’t afford to allow unemployment to soar in the s, discarding thousands of communities and hundreds of thousands of grafters – including the young whose livelihood will be blighted forever. Thatcher threw away coal miners, shipyard and steel workers. Johnson’s ditching people in shops and the music industry, gyms and theatres. Red wall Tories, nervous blue MPs in constituencies borrowed from Labour in England’s North and Midlands, quietly fret the charlatan who helped them win last year is this year signing their electoral death warrants. Equally a Rishi Sunak basking in poll ratings superior to a line manager he dreams of supplanting in No  could quickly go from hero to zero.

Millions of pensioners face being stripped of the benefit when curbs are due to come into force on August .Restrictions were due on June  but were delayed by two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.A last-ditch fight to preserve the leline unfolded in the House of Lords where calls mounted for the Tories to protect free licences. Labouraposs Lord Foulkes, who chairs Parliamentaposs cross-party group on ageing and older people, wanted Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden and incoming BBC director-general Tim Davie to hold talks and thrash out a plan to save the benefit.  But Government Minister Baroness Barran said: “The BBC is responsible for the over-sapos licence fee concession, not the Government. “The BBC Board is keeping the start date of their new policy for over-s under review and has said it will announce its decision on any further delay to the changes to the concession in July.” Lord Foulkes fumed: “Thataposs a totally unacceptable answer. “Surely both the BBC and the Government have accepted, by postponing for two months, how vital television is for old people keeping in touch with vital information from the Government as well as entertainment and other information. “Since many old people are being asked to be in lockdown indefinitely, surely it is not too much to ask the Government and the BBC to get together now to discuss postponing this withdrawal of the free TV licences also indefinitely.” The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until . But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the leline from June , under a deal agreed in . It says keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -.  The corporation is introducing restrictions, meaning only over-s who receive Pension Credit will be eligible. An estimated . million OAPs are due to miss out. The Mirror is campaigning to save the benefit, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. Lord Foulkes urged Baroness Barran to pledge that “the BBC and the Government will get round the table to discuss postponing this indefinitely”. But she swerved answering, instead paying tribute to the “sacrices” made by the elderly “during the past few months”. The “responsibility” for funding free licences is “absolutely clear”, she insisted. Labouraposs Baroness Joan Bakewell, a broadcaster, said the Covid- pandemic “has emphasised more than ever the dependence of the over-s on their television sets, particularly those isolating”. Liberal Democrat culture spokeswoman Baroness Jane Bonham-Carter, a cousin of actress Helena Bonham-Carter, said the Government should “take back responsibility for the licence fee concession for the over-s, introduced by a Labour government as something to be paid for by the Government and not by the licence fee payer, and which the BBC was, quite frankly, forced into taking on”.Labouraposs Lord Wilf Stevenson said: “This was a budget cut imposed on it by the Chancellor in a crude attempt to evade the Governmentaposs statutory responsibility for welfare policy.” Baroness Barran insisted the “BBC themselves regarded it as a good deal” when it formed part of licence fee settlement negotiations in . However, a BBC spokeswoman said last week: The Government decided to end the free TV licence for the over-s and gave the BBC Board responsibility to decide on its future.

The duke, who last week outlined his personal commitment to tackling institutional racism, warned that past wrongs needed to be acknowledged across the Commonwealth in order to move forward, while Meghan said people needed to push through an uncomfortable phase towards equality. The couple joined Chrisann Jarrett, co-founder of We Belong, which is led by young people who migrated to the UK, and Alicia Wallace, director of Equality Bahamas. Also on the July  chat were Mike Omoniyi, founder of The Common Sense Network and Abdullahi Alim, who leads the World Economic Forumaposs Global Shapers. The duke told them: When you look across the Commonwealth, there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past.  So many people have done such an incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs, but I think we all acknowledge there is so much more still to do. Itaposs not going to be easy and in some cases itaposs not going to be comfortable, but it needs to be done, because, guess what, everybody benefits. Former Suits star Meghan spoke of how equality was a fundamental human right.  Weaposre going to have to be a little uncomfortable right now, because itaposs only in pushing through that discomfort that we get to the other side of this and find the place where a high tide raises all ships, she said. Equality does not put anyone on the back foot, it puts us all on the same footing - which is a fundamental human right. Harry addresses the issue of unconscious bias, sharing his own perspective. We canapost deny or ignore the fact that all of us have been educated to see the world dferently, he said. However, once you start to realise that there is that bias there, then you need to acknowledge it, you need to do the work to become more aware ... so that you can help stand up for something that is so wrong and should not be acceptable in our society today. After the Sussexes stepped down as a senior working royals, Harry had to leave his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.

Mum-of  Sue Radford spoke out as the family was left terried that someone was coming into their home through a basement bedroom, where -year-old daughter Millie, who is pregnant, sleeps. In a video uploaded to her social media channel Sue said: We basically had someone try to break into the house last night. Weaposd gone to bed at  past , and just feeding Heidi, for her last feed of the day and Lola was barking like crazy. Honestly she was going absolutely crazy. All I could hear was Ellie and Amy saying aposShut up Lolaapos, anyway she was still not having none of it, she was still barking, looking out the window. The -year-old added: What Lola tends to do is sheaposll go to sleep on Tillyaposs bed, next to Tilly but before she goes to sleep she would normally look out of the window next to Tillyaposs bed so she can see the back yard of our house. Sheaposs barking for ages and then she stops and then we get a phone call from Milly, whose bedroom is in the basement saying I think someoneaposs outside my bedroom.  Sue added that husband Noel had a look around but couldnapost see anyone before Millie and Chloe started screaming: Someone is trying to get in the house. The mum said she ran down and turned the light on and saw two burglars running away, with one pushing the other into the car before driving off with the car doors still open. She added: I said aposThank God for Lola as she knew something was going onapos. The family have three dogs Lola, Bluebell and Ivy. Lola is often seen on walks in the family videos and Bluebell and Ivy are French bulldogs.

The schoolgirl had been due to finish her two years of gruelling chemotherapy on Saturday, but was given the crushing diagnosis two weeks ago. Her parents Marie Bartlett, , and husband Leigh, , are now desperately appealing for volunteers to sign up to the bone marrow register in a bid to find her a match. The couple, of West Bridgford, Nottingham, say she only has three weeks to find a donor after NHS recruitment drives stopped running due to the Covid- outbreak. Marie, a solicitor, and banking boss Leigh said it ripped their hearts out to tell their daughter she needed the transplant following her two year battle with the disease. Upon being diagnosed at  years old the inspirational youngster had said: Mummy, it is ok - itaposs better I get it, than another smaller child. I am stronger and so have a better chance to beat it. But following her relapse, Leigh and Marie are urging people to join the register online via DKMS, The Anthony Nolan Trust or NHS British Bone Marrow Registry. Marie said: It ripped my heart out to tell her and hold her whilst trying to convince her that she had done it once and she could do it again. How do you tell your daughter, whose tiny body has been through so much already, that the cancer she has fought so hard to overcome has ed.  We need to find a match for Amy ideally within the next two to three weeks, so time is of the essence. Dad Leigh, CEO of Masthaven Bank, said: Weaposre just appealing for volunteers to come forward. Please help our inspirational little girl whoaposs been through so much. She really does deserve a break after everything sheaposs been through for the last two and a half years. Amy is an inspiration. The way she has dealt with is has been amazing. As her father, I just want to do everything I possibly can. Thataposs why I am speaking to as many people as I can, to spread the word and get as many people as we possibly can on the register. Sheaposs trying to stay positive, sheaposs a strong young lady, but itaposs pretty tough, especially when you think youaposre so close.  Amy was described as being playful, happy and energetic before she was first diagnosed in February  after complaining about aches and pains in her joints. Her condition was categorised as high risk and she received the most intensive rounds of chemotherapy administered to children diagnosed with the disease. Leigh added: Thereaposs no logical explanation of why sheaposs got it, itaposs just one of those things. Some people get it. She embarked on pretty intensive chemotherapy, for the first three months. Because of the strain of leukaemia she had, it had to be very intensive. She lost all of her hair, lost a lot of her strength and basically had to be in a wheelchair. She wasnapost strong enough to walk around. She also had some reactions to some of the chemotherapy. Amy had liver problems, steroid-induced diabetes and allergic reactions to medications during her first round of treatment. Leigh said: The first three to four months were really tough. Slowly Amyaposs strength started to come back, her hair started to grow. Day by day, you could see some recovery, but itaposs never a full recovery because youaposre constantly taking this chemotherapy. It really takes all your strength away from you. Roll forward to the start of June, weaposre all getting excited and counting down the days because this Saturday was supposed to be the end of the chemotherapy treatments. They did a test on her three weeks ago and then the following day we got the phone call that changed it all really. They said, unfortunately, theyaposve detected leukaemia has ed in her body. Amy had to be admitted to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham to begin testing and chemotherapy that afternoon. Leigh said: They had to consider, whataposs the right treatment path. Because leukaemia came back, especially while she was still under chemotherapy, the first worry is that the chemotherapy wonapost work anymore. The unfortunate reality is she needs a dferent path to find the solution. That path is a going through a bone marrow stem cell transplant. In order to do that she needs a donor. Thereaposs not a lot I can do. You feel a little bit helpless. Youaposre in the hands of the medical experts. The one thing I can do is raise awareness because times like this you realise how important it is for people to sign up to be a donor. Save somebodyaposs le. It might not be Amyaposs but it could be, you never know. One day, you could be called upon to make a real dference to someoneaposs le so please sign up. Thataposs really the message that Iaposm pushing. Thereaposs a big misconception out there, which is youaposve got to go to the hospital, youaposve got to give blood and everything.The reality is itaposs very straightforward. The big two which is DKMS and the Anthony Nolan Trust, you can sign up online and theyaposll send you a pack through the post.You fill out the form, complete a swab, put it back in the prepaid envelope andit and youaposre on the register. Thataposs really what Iaposm trying to encourage as many people as I possibly can. Her elder brother Marcus, , was tested as a potential option but was not a match, with siblings only having a  per cent chance to be a donor.

Ben Brown, who died on Monday April , was just  years old. He had been an architectural engineering student at the University of Loughborough, but found it hard mentally when he wasnapost on the go. He wrote a letter to his mum Helen Hartery-Brown before his death, Leicestershire Live reports. Helen said how Ben had been living with university housemates during lockdown and communicating with his family. “The lockdown had a massive impact on him,” Helen said. “Ben had not spoken to anyone about how he was feeling. He found it all too overwhelming.” He was also a leader of the Quantum Potatoes Explorer unit of The nd Loughborough Scouts, who have launched the Great Froggo Challenge, which has been taken up by the -strong group. Fellow Explorer Scout and Beaver leader Claudia Sayer said how important Ben had been to the members of the unit and how they came to launch the challenge, which includes a thoughtful section on mindfulness and being able to talk about feelings with others. It is also helping to raise money for the Papyrus charity for prevention of young suicide.  Ben found frogs cute, hence the name of the challenge, which is made up of three sections and designed for all ages. Claudia said the first of it was learning all about frogs, such as its le cycle and also craft based, such as making hand-warmers, frog shaped robots. She said that the middle section of the challenge was more concerted on mindfulness, and mental health: Our Scouts, Cubs and Beavers are all learning how to talk about their feelings. It’s OK to talk about feelings with people and who they might go tothey had problems. Because Ben was really great to talk to about your feelings. “He was somebody who lit up the room. He always took the time to talk to people. Our Explorers are so fond of the memories of just sitting in the kitchen before the sessions started, talking to him about all sorts of things such as academic le, advice about relationships. “There was a whole manner of things they could talk about with him and he always had advice for them andhe didn’t have advice he’d front up with them and say: ‘Look I don’t know the answer to that, but let’s work out a solution together’ - that kind of thing. “And when we got together soon after his passing, that was something that really stuck in their minds that he was somebody they could go to for advice.” Claudia added that the third section was fun and included activities that Ben either previously did with the Explorers that they enjoyed, or was going to do in the future and: “We wanted to share that element of Ben with other Scout groups around the country, and we’ve actually got interest from groups in South Africa doing the challenge as well.” Claudia said that Explorer Ben Reynolds, , designed the badge for the challenge taking his own and everyone ’s memories of Ben to create a badge that Claudia says friends and family have said “That is so Ben.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby born holding mums contraceptive","story":"NewsNewborn baby holds mums contraceptive coil that failed to stop her falling pregnantThe baby boy grabbed his mothers intrauterine device in his hand at Hai Phong International Hospital in the city of Hai Phong in northern VietnamShareCommentsByAlex Cope:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe infant had it held firmly in his hands when the picture was taken \", url\"News, views and top stories .

Airbus  pilot Mohamed Barakat, , allegedly beat his young we before turning his fury on his helpless child, Sofia, following an all-night drinking session in Kazakhstan. He claims the case against him has been “fabricated” by police in Almaty, who committed “gross violations” during the investigation. The British man was detained after his distraught Kazakh we Madina Abdullayeva, , ran into the lobby of the city’s five-star Intercontinental Hotel “screaming for help” early in the morning.  Barakat is accused of repeatedly punching his we on the head before she escaped into the corridor, according to the indictment revealed for the first time. Sofia awoke because of her parentsapos fight and the pilot then turned his fury on the one-year-old, a British citizen, a report by Astana TV claimed. He walked to the babyaposs cot, took his daughter Sofia in his hands and forcefully hit the walls and doors of the hotel room with her head, reads the court indictment. Having made sure Sofia Barakat was not displaying signs of le, he put her on the floor by the entrance door of the hotel room.”  Forensic experts established the child suffered multiple injuries and had no chance of survival in their eighth floor room, a remote session of the court hearing was told. Her skull was fractured and her brain “crushed”, it was reported. The alleged violent attack followed Barakat’sfrom an all-night drinking session at am when his we called his airline to say he was “ill”. The call to Hong Kong Airlines “enraged” the experienced pilot who began punching his we, according to the prosecution case. Barakat’s family in England claim he has faced injustice, corruption andillegal investigation in Kazakhstan.The case is fabricated, said his lawyers in a statement ahead of a scheduled new hearing which is expected to be delayed after a new coronavirus lockdown in Kazakhstan.There is no undisputed and substantiated evidence in the criminal case to prove his guilt for the death of his only child. Attorney Tair Nazkhanov said: The forensic examination reports indicated that there were no fingerprints and DNA from Mohamed on the child’s body, which means that he did not even touch the child that day.  The Almaty Police Department inspected the hotel room with gross violations of the Kazakhstan criminal procedural law. A blood sample found in the luxury hotel room did not end up belonging to the child. The lawyer and two other attorneys, Darkhan Dyussembekov and Abzal Kassymzhanov, said: There is no evidence in the criminal case against Mohamed for the intentional killing of his only child. They are to demand that the case is sent back to the state prosecutor for further examination, claiming the police ignored other explanations as to how the child died. Sofia’s death was from “bilateral compression of the skull”, according to evidence in the case.

The capacity on outdoor terraces will be  per cent but  per cent indoors with a maximum limit of  people for closed places and ,outdoors. Reserved groups of up to eight people will be acceptedfrom the same social or family environment, the rules say. The maintenance of the proper interpersonal security distance between clients or, where appropriate, groups of reserved clients, as well as due control to avoid agglomination, must be ensured, says the order. When there is a space on the premises for a dance floor or similar, it may be used to install tables or reserved spaces, and this space cannot be dedicated to its usual use. Security personnel will ensure that the interpersonal security distance is respected and will avoid the formation of large groups and crowds, paying special attention to the access and immediate areas, as well as any other area where the distance is not respected. Clubs and other nightle establishments must have frequent natural ventilation or, in case of using air conditioning, a sufficient renewal of the air will be guaranteed, capturing the outside air in an appropriate place.Government spokesman Julio Pérez said it had decided to eliminate restrictions because the health situation allows it and announced that in the next week, the Executive will continue with a progressive lting of limitations. The restrictions are similar to those in Mallorca and Ibiza where the smaller clubs are allowed to open but again with no dancing.

There’s no point crying over spilled milk.“It’s a good club, the supporters are very loyal.“A bit like Aberdeen fans in some way – they had a wonderful period under Jim McLean just as Aberdeen did under Sir Alex Ferguson.“That’s how everyone is measured, at United you’re measured against the level Jim McLean reached.“There was a much more level playing field financially back then than there is now but the club still has big ambitions.”Asked about Mellon, the ex-United and Jam Tarts gaffer added: “He was at Hearts as a kid – I played in the same reserve team as him as a young lad, he was on the ground staff way back in .“He’s a good lad and I’ve had quite a lot of dealings with him over the years. Wesigned Cole Stockton from Tranmere and I had a good chat and catch-up with him at that time.“He’s done a good job down there. Dundee United are my second team in Scotland and I’m hopinghe gets the job, he’ll do a good job there.”Meanwhile, Levein has criticised the SPFL over their handling of the season-ending resolution.He also took a swipe at Dundee’s role in April’s controversial events, which is likely to be in the spotlight again as Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal challenge against relegation heads for SFA arbitration.Levein said: “I’ve said all along it’s a huge injustice and to do that to the three clubsI think was disgraceful.“I’m really interested in finding out exactly what happened with the vote from Dundee.“And I find it hard to believe… the vote was in the building at .pm when the deadline was pm then it should’ve been accepted, even though it was found later on.“I think there’s something strange about the whole thing.

This includes an increase in the number of people using our roads for cycling.#As part of our response to this change, road policing officers across the north will be conducting Operation Close Pass checks in areas including Dundee, Perth and Kinross and Angus.#This preventative approach allows for positive engagement and an opportunity to educate and increase driver awareness about the need to give cyclists plenty of space.#Cycling campaigners have been calling for police chiefs to bring Close Pass to Tayside for several years due to what they said was a persistent issue of close-passing by cars, lorries and buses on local roads.There was no logic to the decision not to try it.

I hope this encourages people to stay out cycling .#Mr Pepper believes that a greater number of cyclists being on the roads in Tayside # coupled with a potential rise in people reporting close passes as a result # had left local chiefs with no option but to try out Close Pass.He added: #There was no logic to the decision not to try it. It seems there was a bias against cyclists but it#s great they are cracking on with it.#New research published on Monday by Cycling Scotland found that more than a third of drivers admit to not always passing at a safe distance # and two-thirds were unaware that it was an offence to do so.Keith Irving, chief executive of the advocacy body, said: #As we move out of lockdown, we’re seeing an increase in road traffic and more tragedies on our roads as a result.#Cycling Scotland believes that Operation Close Pass, improving infrastructure and, as soon as it can be implemented, third party reporting of dangerous driving behaviour will all be necessary to keep us all safe.”#No one was expecting such an increase in demand#: Cycling shop owners discuss surge in bike use across Dundee during lockdown\" title\"##No one was expecting such an increase in demand#: Cycling shop owners discuss surge in bike use across Dundee during lockdown# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp no-one-was-expecting-such-an-increase-in-demand-cycling-shop-owners-discuss-surge-in-bike-use-across-dundee-during-lockdown embed # secretlFdlXXAz\" data-secret\"lFdlXXAz\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It#s been really good seeing regular customers during our takeaway service but it will be great to actually look after them properly and get back to some sort of normality.#We#ve been taking bookings online and over the phone and we#ve had a lot of enquiries.#We have a one-way system in place and we also have a QR code for contact tracing. Everybody who comes in has to register and the same applies to staff.#We also have a two-metre distance between all of our benches and we#re going to have to make sure nobody is going between tables or swapping tables.#The Bennachie Lodge in Kemnay will open its beer garden to the public from :am today.Manager Sandy Elrick said: #We#re expecting it to be busier at night than during the day.#We have a booking system in place and we have  tables available for booking.#We have been following guidelines and making sure that one-way systems and other safety measures are in place.#Staff have all been fully briefed and are now Covid-compliant and they know what#s going on.He added: #We are very lucky that we have a huge open space for our beer garden.#We didn#t have to do much to convert the space outside because we have already done a lot of work on the space throughout the year for music events.#I#m excited to be reopening but quite nervous. It will be good to see a lot of the old faces again and we#re looking forward to welcoming them back.#WE ARE OPENBeer Garden  Carry-Out Meals available  days a week #happydayzThe Fabulous beer gardenis#Posted by Bennachie Lodge onMonday,  July A major easing of lockdown measures in England this weekend also saw pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas open their doors under modied social distancing rules but the occasion was marred by chaotic scenes on Saturday night.Police Federation chairman John Apter, who was on duty in Southampton, reported dealing with “naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks”, while there were several reports of officers being assaulted.The Scottish Government is expected this week to confirm whether two metre social distancing may be reduced to one metre, with additional safeguards, in a bid to help more businesses reopen.But Mr Apter warned it was “crystal clear” revellers could not or would not adhere to the “one metre plus” rule already in place in England.Speaking during a visit to a terrace pub in Edinburgh ahead of the reopening on Monday, Ms Sturgeon said sacrices made by the public in Scotland had already helped to suppress the virus and protect the health service.She said: “I hope as we take these first gradual steps out of lockdown people will begin to feel more of the sense of normality that we have worked so hard for, although it is important to remember that the virus has not gone away so we cannot get complacent.“No beer garden or cafe should feel the same as it did before. The vast majority of the hospitality industry will be following the rules and putting in place new procedures to help control the virus.”The Scottish Government is expected to publish further guidelines for the sector this week and it is anticipated phase three measures will also be announced, possibly as early as Thursday.Ms Sturgeon added: “People should look for those safety measures and be aware of the need to follow the facts at all times when out in the community.“If you don’t see those safety measures, or you don’t feel you can follow appropriate hygiene rules, than don’t take the risk.“If we continue to stick to the rules we will be able to drive the virus down further and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead.“Until then support local businessesyou can, socialise safely and make sure that while you enjoy yourself you also protect others.”The reopening of the hospitality sector was welcomed by Stephen Montgomery, president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association.“We understand that there will be changes in place to reduce the spread of Covid- which we are sure customers will understand,” he said.“We would encourage customers to keep to physical distancing measures and work with premises to ensure public health is maintained, including providing staff with contact details to support test and protect.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I have always wanted to go for well-established titles which is why I chose the Commonwealth.“Now we are looking at the big four world titles and seeing where we are there. They are all held by dferent people at the moment. We had a plan set out this year.“I had a show in Elginwhich was the start of what was going to be a strong run in going for that world title shot.“It was similar to what we did for the Commonwealth title we wanted a good run with a fight at the end. However the show in Elgin was cancelled.“It was disappointing but these things happen and we just have to wait for an opportunity to go again.”“The Boxer” charts Fraser’s rise to Commonwealth belt glory secured with a stoppage defeat of Malawi’s Ellen Simwaka in Aberdeen in November .It also focuses on her private le with we Kirsty and the birth of their daughter.Fraser insists the end goal of a world title is the only target that can justy the sacrices she has to make in her boxing career.She said: “The reward has to be worth the sacrice. I’m not missing parts of my baby growing upI’m not going to get a world title. That is the only pay-off for missing those parts of our lives.“I am really very focused on that. It is dficult but I spent so long getting to this point it would then be silly to not try to finish it.”Fraser hopes her boxing career and private le can be an inspiration to others.She said: “Whatever  I have I want to use it for something positive. My home le with my we and our baby is very much there in the documentary.“Hopefully people can look at it and thinkshe can do it why can’t I. Eventhat is just something as simple as being gay, having a family and being happy and content.“There are barriers there to stop you doing anything in le but there are ways around everything. You just have to persevere.“I have been stubborn my whole le and that has got me where I am. Essentially all I have done is work hard.“I am not particularly gted or special in any way.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But this hasn#t stopped our volunteers from supporting young people. So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God. Something worth considering as we too doze on and off in the wee small hours."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-st-andrews-old-kirk","story":"The fallen-down walls and tall standing central gable give it a very picturesque quality, perfectly situated just beyond the edge of the golf course.I may be wrong, but I suspect it is not really a place many people purposely go to visit. As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf. Fiona Rutherford posted: ldquoLoved his cafe.Gillian Duffy said: ldquoAlways used to be the place to hang out at Alfiersquos when a teenager.Alan Fraser said: ldquoBrilliant recognition by the people of Musselburgh.Elaine Black added: ldquoHappy memories.

they deliberately restricted the spaces here to limit disturbance of the important sensitive habitats and wildle.They could have decided to create a larger car parking area to maximise income but, to their credit, they did not do this.In contrast, they allowed much more parking on the opposite side of the estuary, at John Muir Country Park, which is closer to Dunbar and the East Links Family Park.Such zoning is a useful tool both to provide space for people to freely enjoy the outdoors while also protectinghabitats for wildle and for those who prefer a more peaceful environment.Although I support the actions of the council for the reasons given, I do think they should have gone further and imposed some additional restrictions within the John Muir Country Park on the east side of the

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

It may just be the run of great weather through the spring, or the slightly slower pace meaning we can all take the time to enjoy it that bit more. Maybe it is the quieter streets helping us hear the birdsong better, but many folk canrsquot help thinking the reduced traffic and less mowing ndash just less interference all round ndash makes for a much healthier relationship between us and the wildle with which we share our towns and country.For me, the most striking thing is quite how vibrant and green everything has become in a single season without feet tramping over plants or mowers chopping through them. It is almost asnature is just waiting in the wings when we are gone the world around us will recover in the blink of an eye. Thatrsquos one of the most powerful things about the living word, and plants in particular. They donrsquot need us, but we definitely need them. Plants provide us with food, drink and medicines, they clothe us, provide building materials, shape our myths and give us the very oxygen we breathe.Modern society often fools itself into feeling removed from plants, but the vast majority of humanityrsquos cultures are profoundly shaped by the green world around us, and Scotland is no exception. Its rich heritage of plant lore shows how the countryrsquos flora has shaped our history, from the earliest inhabitants right through to the present day. Hints come from archaeological finds ndash ancient log boats hewn from huge, single trees show the importance of the coast and rivers to hunter-gatherer and early settled communities. This is understandable when much of the interior was covered in deep forest. These forests evidently harboured some huge trees,the boats are anything to go by.Millennia of exploitation, climate change and \"land management\" mean there are very few trees as large and straight as these left in Scotland, so we have to imagine these early post-Ice Age times as a primal world, where hunting and gathering were the fundamentals of le. Modern foragers find there is a huge wealth of interesting botanical fayre out there ndash a topic wersquollto later.Plant pollen found in ious Bronze-Age cups and beakers suggest a culture where honey, mead and beer were important aspects of either daily or ritual le, with many of the plant finds potential flavourings for the drinks. Interestingly, brewers and distillers have turned to many of these same species in making modern concoctions, supporting the huge growth in artisan beers and gins.Another wonderful find is the lsquohair-moss caprsquo found in the defensive ditch around the Roman fort of Newstead, near Melrose in the Borders. Woven from the tough stems of the woodland-dwelling hair-moss, Polytrichum, this enigmatic artefact prompts many questions ndash who made it  A Roman soldier, camp attendant or member of a native tribe  Why was it literally lsquoditchedrsquo  Is it a cap, or something   The now peat-blackened stems form a frill of hair around the cap, so my pet theory is that it was the forerunner of the lsquosee-you Jimmyrsquo wigs you can buy in tourist shops. Or maybe not.One of the big issues with archaeological botany is how to interpret these botanical finds. The fact that hazel shells pop up in ancient middens all the time might reflect hazelnutsrsquo popularity and value as nutritious foods or the fact they remain fresh for months. Or it might just be because the hazel shells are tough and survive through to the present while softer fruits, leaves and other parts of the hunter-gatherer diet rot away, giving us a  impression of people who appeared to eat nothing but hazels and shellfish ndash sounds quite posh actually.In more recent times, we are very fortunate that people had the foresight to research and record many fascinating uses ndash one of the champions of this was Sir Robert Sibbald. A th century physician, botanist and eventually Geographer Royal to the Scottish Crown, his passion for plants and their uses led him and friend Andrew Balfour to establish the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This year is the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary and from a small plot of land behind the Palace of Holyrood House, this institution has grown into a pioneer of international research and collaboration on plant ersity and conservation.Sibbaldrsquos pamphlet entitled Provision for the Poor in Time of Dearth and Scarcity was an attempt to list all the edible things in Scotland in case crops failed and famine reared its head again as it had in the \"Seven Ill years\" of the s. Provision for the Poor lists a great many edible plants that could be foraged, as well as many fish, fowl and other animals including wildcat and pine marten ndash essentially the bat or pangolin of their day in Europe. More than one hundred species of plants are listed in the book, although with names such as ldquothe small hemlock chervil with the rough seeds it could be a bit of a lottery trying to identy the correct plant. Chervil would be tasty, while hemlock would be deadly. This one sounds most like bur-chervil, a relatively rare plant which has been eaten in the past. Strangely, Sibbald does not mention a single mushroom, reflecting the Scottish and wider British dread of a fatal error while mushroom hunting.Sibbald does, however, reserve space for seaweeds. Coastal communities across Scotland ate plenty of this nutritious resource, and it was likely on the menu for those earliest settlers millennia before. Martin Martin, a native of Skye was commissioned by Sibbald to document the land, people and natural history of the Gaelic-speaking parts of the country through the late s. His renowned account A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland mentions many uses for seaweeds as fertilisers, snacks and medicines. Carrageen pudding was made from carrageen seaweed and is still made widely today. It needs plenty of flavouring ndash traditionally lemon, pepper or vinegar. Reminiscent of a supernaturally bland cregraveme caramel it was thought particularly good for invalids recovering from stomach problems. The jelly-like chemicals in the seaweed help to set the milk for the pudding. Called carrageenans, they can be found in a host of modern products as gelling agents.Seaweeds are fascinating group. As dferent from most land plants as we are, these marine algae are abundant and wonderfully erse. The burned ash of some of the big brown seaweeds was the basis for Scotlandrsquos kelp industry in the th and th centuries. Thousands of tonnes of mineral-rich seaweed ash were produced annually and made many of the lairds in coastal areas very wealthy men. The same could not be said of the crofting families that were set to making the pits on the beach, hauling the weed and tending the fires as they smouldered. Parts of the Orkney archipelago were likened to volcanoes because of the smoke billowing up day and night from the shores. The kelp ash was very versatile ndash as a fertiliser, for bleaching linen or use in glassmaking. Inevitably, cheaper replacements were found over time and the bottom had fallen out of the industry by the s. The lairds who had grown comfortable on the profits of the industry looked straightaway to the next big thing ndash sheep. The failure of Scotlandrsquos kelp industry went hand-in-hand with the Highland Clearances.Tracing where these ideas about plants and their uses come from, and how they change on their journey, is fascinating. Plant medicines are a great source of such stories. St Johnrsquos Wort is an excellent example ndash it appears in classical Roman literature as fuga daemonum ndash the chaser of demons. It was widely used as a medicine throughout Europe from Classical times ndash the idea possibly spreading with the Romans, although one of its names in Gaelic suggests a strong connection to the Celtic god Lug who filled a similar role to St John as a shining, heroic sort. Of course, in Gaelic Christianity, the plant became St Columbarsquos plant and was known by one curious name reported by Alexander Carmichael: \"armpit package of St Columba\". Pieces of the plant were tucked into the oxter, where the sweat and hair would presumably break up the plant and allow the active \"demon-chasing\" principle into the thin skin of the armpit. This is a beautully elegant interpretation of the plantrsquos antidepressant compounds. If you were beset by devils, an interpretation of psychiatric issues such as depression, then surely the power of a saint or a god working through the plant would vanquish those demons.We still do not understand how St Johnrsquos wort works as an antidepressant and it can have signicant, dangerous interactions with other medicines, but it is just one example of a rich folklore building up around a real-le bit of biochemistry. How  would people have interpreted this seemingly magical property of the plant  The sinister associations of foxglove with witches, the dead or fairy-folk reflect a poison still used as a medicine in heart conditions today. There are many other examples of intriguing tales where a botanical story might hold the key to a new medicine, and many where the story is seemingly just that ndash a story. Why, for example, do witches supposedly fear rowan trees  Is it the red berries or some other property lost to time ndash and has anyone actually done a proper double-blind scientic research study on it  Of course it doesnrsquot matter why, but just take a look at how many gardens have a rowan tree by the gate and you can see that these stories run deep in the cultural psyche.As well as the ideas and stories, our flora also contains many plants that were brought here by humans, either intentionally or by happy accident. These are the lsquonon-nativersquo flora and actually make up about half the species we find in Scotland today. The vast majority of these are rare, often limited to the port towns where they arrived, or the gardens they were cultivated in. A very few of them can be invasive, but they have all contributed to ersity of our new flora. In the face of climate change and globalisation, the flora changes all the time, and many species, both native and non-native are hugely adaptable. Watch this spaceas the sweet cicely brought by monastic communities from central Europe as a flavouring and strewing herb evolves into a unique new iety or species cut off from its original populations.Many traditionally useful plants are important parts of Scotlandrsquos ancient native habitats. These are precious and unique places with global signicance for bioersity. The incredibly rich Atlantic oakwoods ndash our local \"west-coast rainforest\" ndash have a profusion of lichens, mosses and ferns, but are potentially threatened by development. The pinewoods of the north west and mountains are hemmed in by vast tracts of heather moorland while the looming threat of climate change is never far from the headlines. However,you fence off the heather moorland, excluding grazing deer and sheep, the recovery is nothing short of miraculous ndash within a matter of a decade you have a beautully rich young pine woodland emerging. Once again, we see how resilient plants and habitats can be.Scottish Plant Lore, an Illustrated Flora, explores the wealth of versatile plants on a tour from the seashore up the mountains to the city streets. The beautul illustrations are the work of over  wonderfully talented artists which interpret the Scottish native flora in watercolour, acrylic, pencil or even the ink from the ink-cap mushroom tap.Dr Gregory J Kenicer is a research botanist in the education department at the Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it.

It may be that it has done so more effectively than the UK Government it has certainly looked more competent, and deserves to be commended for that.But until we can realistically compare international data, reliably test the rate of infection, and have information about levels of immunity , it is too early to say so definitively.There is still no cure, no vaccine, and no indication of whether a second, even worse, spike is likely. It is even theoretically possible that countries with what look like the worst results now will fare best in the long run, though to pin hopes on that would certainly have been an unreasonable basis for government responses. The trouble is that no one knows, so the precautionary principle ndash what scientists lean on when the science is uncertain ndash is the obvious approach to the medical risks.The damage wrought by coronavirus is not merely to health, however: while it is understandable, and correct, that the Government should have made that the immediate priority, it also has to consider other costs and risks.In education, employment, the economy ndash particularly tourism, hospitality, arts and retail sectors ndash welfare, taxation and other issues, excessive caution has produced devastating, measurable costs, not all economic.

This is hardly surprising as the mere prospect of this would have caused his former employers at Tesco to reach for the Diocalm.Sir Tom rightly concluded that Scotlandrsquos small to medium enterprisesheld the key to recovery over the next five years, though he ought to press for a more nimble and adroit approach to public sector procurement. He also wrote passionately about the need to consider ideas from a wider arc of talents.ldquoDo not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand, he urged Nicola Sturgeon. ldquoLet us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this, he added.Yet, while I may be inclined to trust an entrepreneur with a veriable track record of making ladders rather than pulling them up, Irsquod demur at ceding signicant influence to the wider business community.

In practice it means that I wont get back to Scotland with this airline and, in order to remain stranded here for the foreseeable time, Irsquoll have to pay for an expensive one-way flight with a dferent airline.My stay in Germany is by no means a leisure trip. There will be more people like me who travel for essential family and business reasons and now have to put up with more unnecessary uncertainty, inconvenience and extra cost just because the SNP and other devolved governments are in a huff.Withholding agreement to end this flawed quarantine policy for countries like Germany, which have a demonstrably better record on dealing with the pandemic and a sustained lower infection rate than Scotland, is simply unacceptable and a slap in face of our partners in the EU and beyond, effectively telling them that Scotland is firmly closed for business.Thankfully the UK Government has seen sense and ends quarantine for international travellers. Meanwhile I live in the hope that discussions between Westminster and the devolved administrations will lead to the Edinburgh Government giving up its nonsensical stance on this issue.Regina Erich, c o Essen, Germany, permanent address Stonehaven.ONCE again Nicola Sturgeon has criticised the most recent UK Governmentrsquos Covid- announcement, the air bridges quarantine policy .She certainly knew in advance that a policy was imminent and she may have a point that the Scottish Government was given little or no time to study it. However, now she wants time to fully peruse and examine the policy before either agreeing with it or dismissing it. My guess is that she will agree with it but it will probably not be introduced to Scotland until the usual one week later than England. We always seem to be trailing England, but again she always maintains that we have got to be safe and must not jump into decisions.The questions that arise are as follows. Why did the Scottish Government not draw up its own list of countries where an air bridge could be introduced  Would that have been too dficult, or is it because Ms Sturgeon wants the UK Government to do the research and development, so that she can be in a position to criticise Why are Scottish families who are now into the formal school holidays having to wait for her decision  As the schools willin mid-August, the clock is tickingthey want to get away for a European holiday, so delaying it will not give them much of an opportunity for an overseas break.It would certainly be very positive, and welcome,for once Ms Sturgeon could agree at once with a Covid- policy that originated from the UK Government. As our Prime Minister has stated the devolved governments are generally following the same route, the only thing is that we seem to be trailing behind as usual. What a shambles.John Cuthbertson, Leuchars.BORIS Johnson and his Government are in full-on self-congratulatory mode after achieving a deal with European countries over cross-border travel.

Such a isive assertion is absolute nonsense which in itself can only give rise to ill-feeling.It may well be the case that many of us domiciled in Scotland disapprove strongly of the approach of the hyper-nationalist clique in power in Westminster to such issues as immigration, Brexit, the handling of the pandemic, relationships with Donald Trump and Britainrsquos role in the world. That disapproval is shared with many in England, and thus should not be associated with nationalist sentiment north of the Border.John Milne, Uddingston.ACCORDING to David McEwan Hillhe was \"confused\" after reading the excellent letter from Dr Gerald Edwardsand then went on to make some astonishing claims about the Scottish economy. For example, he claimed that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports\". Really  This is nonsense, as UK companies exported pound billion worth of goods and services across the globe in  whereas Scotland only contributed pound.bn. He then made a lot of play about Scotland exporting power to England but failed to mention that most of the wind power is subsidised by the English taxpayersand with little back-up powerwill become very reliant on rUK for power.With regard to his comment about Scotland being the only \"viable economic unit\" in the UK when most people understand that London and the south-east of England are in a league of their own is equally laughable ndash notwithstanding the fact our fiscal deficitwas five times that of rUK.But he keeps the best to last with his assertionis that England somehow wants to \"hang on to us\". Perhaps he forgot it was the Scottish people who voted for us to remain in the Union, not the English.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.DAVID McEwan Hill writes that \"Scotland provides  per cent of the UKs exports, has a higher per capita in manufacturing base, feeds itself ...\".While I dont know whether the first two parts quoted above are factual or not, I think Im on safe ground challenging the part where Mr Hill would have us believe Scotland feeds itself.From looking on the ious shelves of my local supermarket I can see all manner of produce from countries other than Scotland.The UK may well import more than  per cent of its food, but given Scotland is part of the UK, it is likely Scotland also imports a similar percentage of food.And as for Scotland being the only viable economic unit in the UK, I believe Mr Hill may be suffering from an overdose of SNP independence propaganda.Brian Bell, Kinross.Read more: Struan Stevenson: Johnson has shown the way forward"},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-hugs-hairdos-talk-tv-steamie","story":"There was none of that, however, with both presenters the picture of smooth professionalism, eventhey had clearly failed to bag a hair appointment ndash unlike Matt Hancock, Englandrsquos Health Secretary.ldquoI had my hair cut yesterday and Irsquom very relieved about it, he told Ridge proudly en route to The Andrew Marr Show.On the BBC programme the Minister was, unusually, not top of the bill.

Fragmenting your own market is a strange way of taking back control ndash but this is Brexit.Meanwhile, Covid- quarantine restrictions at the UKrsquos borders were, belatedly, set up in early June only for the UK government to start dismantling them again within weeks. Certainly, the pandemic has been educational for many learning that health is devolved across the UKrsquos four nations ndash with police in Wales stopping English day-trippers heading across that border during lockdown. Yet Boris Johnson insisted last week that \"there is no such thing as a border between England and Scotland\".Back in Brexit-land, Ireland struck a deal on Friday with its fellow EU member states on transporting its food products across the UKrsquos third country land bridge to continental ports without getting stuck at the back of a queue of British lorries. Ireland, after all, is still in the EUrsquos single market .It gets worse.

It also shows that, in the general population in England, support for independence is at %, which is interesting because thatrsquos broadly where support for Scottish independence was in Scotland  years ago. In other words, this could be the beginning of a new trend in England, who knows.In other ways, the poll is only confirming what we know already: the highest support for nationalism and independence in England comes from voters who lean to the right whereas in Scotland, it generally comes from the left. But that doesnrsquot mean wersquore dealing with completely dferent beasts here. Far from it: there are striking similarities between the instincts of some English Tories and Scottish nationalists and they help explain two things: why the parties behave as they do, and why there is a large group of voters they struggle to reach.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeIn the case of the Conservative Party, English Tories ndash like Scottish nationalists ndash have always possessed a strong sense of national identity, sometimes romantic, sometimes bellicose. At party conferences, Tories are unselfconscious about bellowing out Land of Hope and Glory in the way that Scottish nationalists are unselfconscious about Flower of Scotland. The leaders of the Tory party have also always known the power of English iconography ndash Stanley Baldwin used to talk about ldquothe tinkle of the hammer on the anvil and the call of the corncrake on a dewy morning ndash just as SNP leaders know the power, for some, of tartan and bagpipes.Politically, Tory leaders ndash again, like leaders of the SNP ndash have also always been aware of the usefulness of national identity . Disraeli said he had ldquoalways considered that the Tory party was the national party of England and a few years later leading Tories set up the Patriotic Association with a weekly paper called ldquoEngland. Some  years later, Boris Johnson tapped into exactly the same English patriotism to fuel support for the campaign to leave the European Union just as the SNP taps into Scottish patriotism to fuel support for leaving the UK.The leadership of both the Tories and the SNP are also aware of the trick, because it works for some people, of using national identity to denigrate their opponents as un-English, un-Scottish, un-patriotic or un-something . Disraeli said Liberalismrsquos aim was to ldquoeffect the disintegration of the Empire of England whereas the leadership of the SNP frequently accuse their opponents of failing to stand up for Scotland or doing it down. Itrsquos all the same kind of stuff really, whether itrsquos English or Scottish or British: nationalism as a stirrer of intense passions and a political recruiter.But it only goes so far, because not everyone is stirred by nationalistic sentiments: some hearts soar but some hearts sink, and that poses a problem for politicians of a nationalistic bent. Strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have always been unattractive to many liberals and voters who occupy the crucial centre ground ndash the kind that the SNP in particular needs to recruit. More recently, some of the more liberal Tory leaders have also struggled in  for example, Alex Salmond showed no shame or embarrassment in his patriotism and nationalism, while for David Cameron it was all a bit squirmy and awkward.Whatrsquos happening is that all of this creates issues for centrist politicians who oppose nationalism, like Cameron in  or Keir Starmer in , particularly when, in all its forms, nationalism appears to be on the rise. However, it also poses problems for English Tories and Scottish nationalists who seek to exploit it ndash and it may explain why support for Brexit and Scottish independence both hover around % but not much higher.Take Nicola Sturgeon for example. She knows that sounding stridently nationalistic will attract some Scots to her cause but she also knows that sounding too nationalistic could turn off the centrists she needs to win over. Keir Starmer has a similar problem for Labour, only in a dferent direction. He knows that sounding more obviously patriotic could win back some of the support from English nationalists whorsquove gone over to the Tories, particularly in the north of England, but he also knows thathe goes too far, he risks losing support from centrists, particularly in London and, crucially, Scotland.To make matters worse in Scotland, therersquos another problem here, which is that English nationalism may also be fuelling Scottish nationalism or at least support for the SNP. The most recent poll at the weekend confirms support for independence at around % and support for the SNP high enough to win them another election, and much of this has been fuelled by Brexit which in turn has been fuelled by English nationalism.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe question is how resilient the centre will be in the face of all of this. Clearly, some of the centre ground in Scotland is being eaten away by the SNP, and in a UK context itrsquos left Labour in particular with a dilemma. On English nationalism, one of the solutions that the partyrsquos election review considers is tacking to the centre on economic policy while talking up the partyrsquos patriotic credentials the push and pull of nationalism and unionism is also the reason Labour has been talking about the idea of ldquoradical federalism.But will it be enough  The fear for centrists must be that as English nationalism closes in on one side and Scottish nationalism closes in on the other, like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars, the centre will get squished. In a constitutionally eccentric country like the UK, itrsquos also unclear what the centrists can do. One option is to sound more nationalistic, but that may hasten the crushing. The other is to continue to call for another way. But as the walls close in, they may not be heard over the noise.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

He died eight years ago, leaving his fortune to his only son, Christopher.According to Bently Heritagersquos website, Mr Bently, travelled to Scotland twice as a young man to explore his Scottish heritage and instantly ldquofelt at home.ldquoInstantly he felt at home, connected, and gained a passion for the land and culture. He says, lsquoItrsquos something in the terroir and history that makes Scotland so specialrsquoIt adds that Mr and Mrs Bentlytook inspiration from a tour ofScottish distilleries to launchtheir own whisky distillery in a renovated mill.ldquoAs an avid environmentalist, Christopher Bently insists on nothing less than exemplary green operating practices, it adds.He is also a former director of the Burning Man festival, an arts and music event held annually at the Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada, which features the symbolic burning of a giant figure.Mrs Bently, meanwhile, is said to take pride in the estatersquos ldquoenvironmentally-responsible agricultural practices, growing non-GMO and heritage grains.Kildrummy Estate includes the B-Listed property originally built in  as a private residence and accommodation for large shooting parties. More recently it was used as Kildrummy Castle Hotel.There is also a modern architect-designed property,  estate houses and cottages, and more than  acres of farmland.According to estate agents, Savills, the all year-round availability of hunting and shooting ldquomakes Kildrummy more appealing than other estates in Scotland.

And he thinks his subject has changed so much it might need a new name.He is currently dotting the irsquos and crossing the trsquos on a new book, Fractured Union, to be published by Oxford University Press next spring.In it, he talks of ldquoneo-unionists.Mr Keating described border rhetoric as ldquojust confusion and hot air.But he added: ldquoLying behind this is a question about the nature of unionism. Why are Tory MPs trying to say these things about the border ldquoWe have this strident rhetoric where anything that looks like a border is a violation of their conception of union.ldquoMy argument is that the Union is in a bad way. There used to be an understanding of what the UK was.ldquoEven in the days when some were resisting devolution, there was this idea that there was a union of nations, not a unitary state.ldquoSo the nations were dferentiated in lots of dferent ways.ldquoIn a nation-state, you have a demos, a people a telos, which is a shared purpose an ethos, shared values and a principle of sovereignty. And these things are all in the same place.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeldquoThe UK was never like that.Since devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unionists, said Mr Keating, have struggled to define the Union.Devolution has dented centralised sovereignty in Westminster ndash even as Brexiters seek to repatriate powers from Brussels.And ndash as the Covid crisis has underlined ndash it has led to policy ergence across the UK that makes some of the new breed of unionists uncomfortable.Mr Keating summed up: ldquoOn the one hand this group of unionists are doubling down on parliamentary sovereignty and on the other hand they are pushing a Britishness.ldquoWhat they are saying, in my language, is that the UK has a demos, the British people a telos, that we agree on what the constitution is an ethos, what they call British values and a principle of sovereignty.\"So unionism, which was never a nationalism, has become a nationalism.This, for Keating, presents a problem.The UK used to allow huge flexibility in identity, something the helped deliver the Good Friday Peace Agreement or the Welsh and Scottish devolved parliaments.ldquoIt was never required for us all to sign up to all these bits of Britishness, he explained.ldquoThat was the genius of the UK in the past. Mainstream unionism has always accepted dferences.Authorities across the UK have followed broadly similar policies on tackling Covid.However, even minor dferences in practice and policy have been highlighted by unionist politicians across all four nations as decentralisation became more politically salient than ever before.:Why has it taken a pandemic for anti-devolution views to go viral ldquoCovid has raised all of this. The initial response was lsquoletrsquos all go togetherrsquo and then there was dferentiation.ldquoThe SNP and Welsh Labour have grabbed leadership, the policies may not be radically dferent but they have certainly taken ownership of these policies.ldquoThat is how devolution works.Some of neo-unionists ndash to use Keatingrsquos term ndash have not been happy.Last month, Herald on Sunday reported on the new breed of devo-sceptics, including those who believe Holyrood, the Senedd and Stormont should close.But Mr Keating stresses not all neo-unionists want to shut devolved parliaments they just do not want them to do anything dferent."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11555834.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sam-heughan-scottish-actor-tipped-fans-next-james-bond","story":"Outlander actor Heughan, , beat off stars including Idris Elba and Tom Hardy in a poll forRadioTimes.The poll attracted almost , votes from across the world, with the Dumfries and Galloway-born actor coming away the clear favourite -

budget, the Scottish Government allocated pound million to fund the college sector with a further pound.m to be spent on college capital needs.But what we saw as the coronavirus outbreak started, illustrated perfectly just how well spent that money has been in creating this highly innovative national resource.How Scotlandrsquos colleges switched incredibly swtly to digital teaching and assessment was a brilliant shop window of their adaptive skills, as we all moved into new ways of operating and thinking.Their students and staff then rose just as impressively to the complex everyday challenges presented by Covid, by offering their time, skills and much-needed materials such as personal protective equipment to both the NHS, and to some of the most vulnerable members of their own communities, to first react and now recover, via social care and community organisations.Their skills also came to the fore by addressing some complex engineering and other disciplines brought into play, for ious sectors to react to the crisis.How our college sector emerges now from Covid- will have ahuge influence on how we do as a country.Thatrsquos why throughout the crisis, I have been meeting regularly with college principals, unions and student representatives to ensure every practical effort is being made for them to resurface in good shape ready for next term, so they can remain at the forefront of our economic recovery.We are publishing new guidance this week to help Scotlandrsquos collegesprepare their staff and students for a safe and phasedin the new term, using a blended model of remote and limited on-campus learning.The flexibility and professionalism colleges have shown in the past  days has demonstrated they are more than well equipped to provide not only a safe working environment for everyone, but to support students in their studies with the highest quality of learning and teaching.I have been a proud Further and Higher Education Minister as I watched our network react so brilliantly to the Covid crisis, and would like to thank them for that collective effort.I am of no doubt, whatever, they will continue to rise to the ongoing challenges of not only recovering from the effects of this once-in-a-letime situation but continuing to provide the productive pipeline of the talent we need to prosper as an economy.Richard Lochhead is Scotlandrsquos Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science"},{"url":null,"title":"frederick-douglass-statue-vandalised-anniversary-famous-speech","story":"Police said the statue of Douglass was taken on Sunday from Maplewood Park, a site along the Underground Railroad where Douglass and Harriet Tubman helped shuttle slaves to freedom.The statue was found at the brink of the Genesee River gorge about ft from its pedestal, police said.

Itrsquos a phrase as synonymous with the pandemic as ldquounprecedented times and, while they may be buzz words, there is truth in their meaning.The modern world has never experienced anything like this. Economies around the world have ground to a halt as governments scrambled to control the spread of the virus.Modern le does not offer many ndashany ndash opportunities to monitor the impact of switching off the economy. While it has taken a substantial toll, the lockdown has given us this opportunity and we must not waste it.Irsquom sure we have all noticed the way the air seems clearer and nature seems louder and livelier during lockdown. Thatrsquos not a coincidence the complete cessation of economic activities has lowered the detrimental impact on the environment.To borrow a phrase, this is an unprecedented time to explore additional ways of tackling the climate crisis.Eighteen national academies and science societies across the Commonwealth have joined forces to urge governments to address climate change and bioersity loss and, in particular, ensure global economic recovery from Covid- is environmentally sustainable. The Commonwealth academiesrsquo statement on climate change, bioersity and sustainable energy, which the Royal Society of Edinburghhas signed as Scotlandrsquos national academy, sends a call to action to heads of state to take urgent action. It warns that failure to tackle these combined challenges in the increasingly narrowing timescale required will pose signicant risk to human development and welfare, societal inequalities, and impact all Commonwealth countries and globally.Addressing climate change and bioersity loss must be a core theme on the road to recovery. We must explore the possibility of changing the way we live ndash creating a ldquonew normal ndash to develop sustainable economic growth, cheap, clean energy and better public health tackle poverty and inequality limit global warming and replace bioersity loss. We need to address dficult questions, including the impact of humans encroaching on wildle and their natural habitats, which increases the risk of viruses, like Covid-, transmitting between species.In all cases, planning and action is needed now, including further research to complete our knowledge gaps and translate research into policy. Global leadership is also required, which is present, but has not met the necessary scale of action.Key events have been delayed, including COP and COP, raising the risk that efforts to address climate change will also be delayed. More research and planning can be conducted in the meantime, but without the opportunity to meet and raty decisions, certain joint actions cannot be progressed.The RSE has established a Post-Covid- Futures Commission to support Scotland in emerging as positively as it can from the current pandemic. It brings together leading practitioners and thinkers to identy and address immediate policy implications and challenges arising from the coronavirus outbreak and support thinking around some of the bigger questions it raises. This is a progressive step towards building a more resilient and fairer society informed by evidence, expertise, and public dialogue.We need to see this replicated on a wider, global scale.

If we are all considerate to each other’s needs, people will feel safer and go out more, which may reduce loneliness and social isolation and help with their health and wellbeing.”The information sheet has been endorsed by Transport Scotland, Public Health Scotland, Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland as well as Cycling Scotland, Forth Environment Link, Living streets, Paths for All, Ramblers Scotland, Scottish Canals and Sustrans Scotland.To access the information sheet, visit: www.sustrans.org.uk about-us our-work-in-scotland walking-cycling-and-wheeling-during-covid--in-scotland copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed with an excellent  stableford points, separated from a renewed Kevin ‘Lava’ MacLeod by virtue of the better inward half.The Kenneth MacKenzie Jubilee Trophy on Saturday was won by Martyn MacLeod with .He too managed by virtue of a stronger finish than DJ MacLeod’s .DJ had an incredible three birdies and an eagle in his opening nine holes to be out in .

who have a share on it # would agree to its sale and use.All but one of them did. to resolve.The erosion of hard-fought crofting rights is the last thing for which the West Highland Free Press would argue.Thanks to security of tenure, succession rights, and favourable grant and loan schemes crofting has been the Highlands and Islands’ most effective affordable housing policy for more than a century.But it seems ridiculous that a development for local families – earmarked for bare pasture of little other use # can still be blocked on the whim of one inidual.And the irony is that anyone familiar with the region would be able to point to countless examples of ‘in-bye’ land # the better quality fields that traditionally accompany a croft house # being carved up and sold on as expensive plots without a murmur from either planners or crofting regulators.In recent years we have seen parliamentary acts on crofting, community empowerment and the right-to-buy land, as well as a much-heralded Scottish islands bill.There are also more than enough public bodies.Addressing rural depopulation # accompanied by a targeted budget to fund small housing schemes and self-build croft houses – could be a mission which unites these organisations in the Highlands and Islands.But the Scottish Land Commission, the crofting commission, housing associations and local authorities have to be better at working together to make sure the legislation we already have makes a dference and delivers results.The Staffin example tells us that a way must be found to protect the rights of inidual crofters and agricultural land for the wider interest, while at the same time ensuring ground is also made available to house families on which the future of these communities will depend.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/auction-1-2.jpg","title":"going going gone skye lecturer hosts online auction today for foodbanks and indian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe auction which is being held on Facebook has around  unique handmade items, which have been kindly donated by creative people who live all around Scotland.Originally from Shetland, Layla Sawford moved to Portree in January to work for the University of the Highlands and Islands.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

If accurate, this is a totally unacceptable situation.A tenth of the staff were unavailable for work because of Covid-, which has meant many others have been working overtime, an NIAS spokesperson said.This level of overtime is not sustainable and it means on occasions we are unable to provide the planned level of cover in some areas, the statement added.NIAS said it has plans to cover when operational staff is reduced, including adding crews from other stations, extending Rapid Response Paramedic hours, increasing use of accident and emergency support vehicles and Voluntary and Private Ambulance Services .Southern Area Manager Mark Cochrane told armaghi: It is a source of regret to me whenever ambulance cover is depleted due to a lack of available resources and the potential impact this may have on the community we serve.Demand for NIAS services has increased signicantly over recent years without a corresponding increase in ambulance resources.We are working to address the issue and fill existing vacancies with ongoing regional recruitments and training.I would like to express my gratitude to those staff, on the frontline and in ambulance control, who continue to work tirelessly to ensure that an ambulance response is provided to those who have an immediate and le-threatening need.Belfast Most ReadConvicted fraudster dies after choking on piece of food at NI restaurantBrothers in arms: Pallbearers Lynch, Murray and #The Surgeon# turn Storey#s send-off into show of strengthTyrone GAA star Peter Loughran charged in multi-million drugs probeSadistic troll who targeted Noah Donohoe#s grieving mother probedTributes paid as man loses le in swimming tragedy off Co Antrim coast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Commission revealed that it received a late notication from The Glendermott Valley Flute Band. It will march in the Waterside area of the city on the Tullyally Road and Ardmore Road on July . The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

Public church services resumed this week in the latest easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Pubs and restaurants were also allowed to reopen on Friday. Speaking at Mass today at St Eugenes Cathedral, the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said there was still confusion in relation to some religious services. “This last week, I have been trying to work out whether the NI Executive has now given us permission to baptise,” said Bishop McKeown. “I know that it sounds ridiculous that Churches have to get political clearance to baptise a baby or an adult! googletag.cmd.push “Of course, I can understand the thinking behind the earlier temporary baptism ban because, for some, sacramental events seem to refer to the large parties afterwards. “Now we can have the baptism parties – but I am unclear whether we can actually have the baptism before the party!” Bishop McKeown said he was not sure whether the legal restrictions have changed or whether people still waiting for further clarication. “When politicians accuse others of not understanding government messages, that might suggest a lack of clarity in the messaging rather than merely culpable deafness on the part of the listeners,” he added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable.

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene.
