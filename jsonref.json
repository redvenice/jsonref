The makeup artist had to strategically apply the bubbles’People think of the Bros brothers as very serious and into themselves, but I’ve known them from the start and they’ve always been up for a bit of a laugh. This picture of Luke was taken for Cosmopolitan towards the end of the 1990s. The magazine had done a famous portrait of Burt Reynolds on a bearskin rug in 1972 and I wanted this shoot with Luke to resurrect the idea of the male pin-up. It was something I’d already had experience of because I’d done a couple of calendars called the Blues Boys in the mid-80s – it was a company run by women who were sick of all the male-orientated pin-up calendars that were on the walls of garages.I initially shot Luke smoking a cigar, with just a towel hiding the crown jewels, and that shot was what ended up going in the magazine. But I wanted to try out something more jokey too, so I hired a roll-top bath and got Luke in it. We tried filling it with water but the plug didn’t work properly. The studio was on the top floor of a block in Islington and the water dripped through into the office below – they came up to complain only to find a naked pop star in a bath.I always like photos that make you smile. I used to carry a bag of props around with me just to make photos more interesting – I’ve shot Toyah wearing rabbit ears, Ian McCulloch with a bunch of carrots and Robert Smith up a tree.The band had broken up by the time of this picture and Luke was embarking on his acting career. He had no problem getting completely naked – although his missus was there, keeping an eye on him. The makeup artist had to strategically apply the bubbles. She didn’t mind. In fact, I think she quite enjoyed her day!I remember taking some Polaroids to show Luke and he said: “Oh my God, I look like I’ve got a body.” He actually had a good upper body but very skinny legs. That’s why I turned him sideways and hid them in the bath.I had a good relationship with both Matt and Luke. They were ordinary teenage kids when I first met them, although as they got bigger they became a bit more precious and their timekeeping definitely got worse. They’d turn up four hours late and we’d have to then work until 3am. I watched the recent Bros documentary, which shocked me. At the beginning, when Matt was in his Las Vegas apartment talking about crystals, I thought: “My God, what’s happened to him?” But by the end I recognised them as the same people – especially their need to always break off and discuss things intensely.I’d actually forgotten about taking this picture. I only printed it recently when I was looking for pop-star images for a new book. It makes me smile because he’s really going for it. I guess he had to – otherwise the whole thing might have looked a bit pathetic!Training: None. I taught myself to take pictures, develop film and print as a hobby while looking for work after university. Luckily, my hobby became my job.Influences: When I first started it was the work of the Hollywood portrait photographers, such as George Hurrell and Angus McBean, as I loved their lighting.

He discusses how her work changed his life‘I always used to joke that I ruined Linda’s career,” says Paul McCartney, sitting on a sofa in his office in Soho, London, with a selection of his late wife’s photographs spread on the table before him. “She became known as ‘Paul’s wife’, instead of the focus being on her photography. But, as time went on, people started to realise that she was the real thing. So, yeah, she eventually did get the correct reputation, but at first it was just blown out of the water by the headline-grabbing marriage.”He has a point. Before she met and married him, in March 1969, Linda Eastman was an award-winning photographer. Born in 1941 and raised in a suburb of New York, she had studied under Hazel Archer – who taught the artist Robert Rauschenberg, among others – and was the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone cover, featuring Eric Clapton. Her speciality was capturing pop stars in unguarded moments: a tearful Aretha Franklin Jimi Hendrix mid-yawn Janis Joplin backstage, her bottle of Southern Comfort already drained. But marriage to a Beatle tended to overshadow your own work and reputation, as Yoko Ono discovered.It wasn’t until years later that her talent was reappraised: 1976’s unassumingly titled book Linda’s Pictures was the first in a series of collections of her work. If anything, her reputation has grown since her death in 1998 – The Linda McCartney Retrospective, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow, is just the latest global exhibition of her work. It was curated by McCartney, along with their daughters, Mary and Stella here, he picks six of his favourite photographs. “As you can probably tell,” he says, after an exhaustive account of one of the McCartneys’ family holidays in Orkney in the early 70s, “I like talking about this stuff.”“She was a great believer in the happy accident. Where other people might have said: ‘Well, this is blurred, we can’t use this one, we’ll go and look for the sharper photographs,’ she went with it. I love this picture – his guitar looks like an instrument from the future, a space-age thing. It just looks to me like his music sounds: exciting blues. A friend of ours, Brian Clarke, made a stained-glass window of this image, which is fabulous: I’ve got it in my studio.”“Linda put you at your ease. Some photographers, you’re very aware that you’re having a picture taken. But she had such a relaxed attitude that she’d get a picture of Jimi Hendrix, but he’d be yawning in it. He felt comfortable enough to yawn, she felt confident enough to take a picture of him yawning, knowing he wouldn’t mind.”“This is me and John, in Abbey Road. It wasn’t too long before the breakup of the Beatles this would be the end of our relationship and, at the end, when the breakup happened, it was kind of sour – very difficult to deal with. The rumour started going around that John and I didn’t get on well, we were arch-rivals, that it was very heavy and ugly. The strange thing is you sometimes get to believe something, if it’s said enough times. So I used to think: ‘Yeah, it’s a pity, you know, we didn’t get on that well.’“So this picture is a blessing for me. It’s like, this is how we were: this is why we related, or else we couldn’t have collaborated for all that time. It sums up what our relationship was like the minute we were actually working on a song, and most of the time we were together, really. I’m just writing something out – possibly it’s a medley or something it might be for Abbey Road – and it’s lovely, because John is very happily in on the process, and agreeing with me, and we’re laughing about something. Just seeing the joy between us here really helped me, because it reminds me that the idea we weren’t friends is rubbish. We were lifelong friends, our relationship was super-special.“That applied to all the Beatles, even when we were pissed off with each other from time to time. People used to remind me: that’s families, that happens. Mates disagree. As soon as we started working on music, we gelled, we just enjoyed the noise we made together, we enjoyed playing with each other. We’d worked together for over 10,000 hours over the years, and that old spirit automatically kicked in. Any disputes were got over very quickly.”“This was taken in London in 1978. I love it because it’s a historic piece, because the cars and everything date it, but it’s also a really good portrait of me.“Technically, I still don’t get this one, because there’s me in the rear-view mirror and I’m in focus, but the houses are in focus and the bus is in focus as well. So I don’t get how that worked. It’s not a montage, it’s a straight photo. And the other thing is that I’m driving, and I think Linda is taking the picture with one of our babies on her lap – if you look, there’s a very faint reflection in the windscreen. Talk about multi-tasking.“One of the things about Linda, when you talk about how people seem at ease in her photos, is that it was her lifestyle. We’d say: ‘Let’s go out of London,’ so I’d just drive, we’d get out of London and I’d say: ‘Where do you want to go?’ She’d say: ‘Just anywhere.’ After a while, you’d end up in areas you didn’t know, going: ‘Ooh, I’m getting a bit lost here,’ and she’d say: ‘Great.’ You were in places you’d never been, you were seeing things you hadn’t intended to see, all of which was rich stuff for her photography. I remember I wrote the song Two of Us about that – ‘Two of us riding nowhere  Spending someone’s hard-earned pay.’ That was one of those excursions, when we were first going out together, this great idea of getting lost. Until I met Linda, I panicked when I got lost, you know?”“One day, we were just on the beach, having a swim, but she’s seen this mother and child, and it’s an interesting moment, so she’s just grabbed her camera and snapped it. She wouldn’t have used a whole reel on it it could even be the only shot. Because she’d had to do things quickly, she’d just worked on the hoof, without an assistant. She didn’t use light meters often – she guessed – so she just went out with a pocket stuffed with film, camera around her neck and that would be it. There’s something fascinating about this moment she’s caught, the way the kid is looking into the camera eerily, the mum with this incredible bathing hat on. I could look at it for hours.”“This was at the airport in Los Angeles. I had to do something record-related – I think it was a convention that Capitol, our American record label, were having – and she happened to be in LA, so she could hang out with me. She’d turn up at the hotel and we’d say: ‘Oh, what are we going to do today? Shall we do something? Well, let’s just stay in,’ and we’d just do nothing, basically. We loved that freedom. It was an important thing in a relationship, that neither of us minded doing nothing much.The Linda McCartney Retrospective is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, from 5 July to 12 January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a798abf32c3bfc8910ae24213b233a2b3bfe03/0_0_2399_2994/master/2399.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c8fd662c4dd056b42e263119e9d268d8 1400w","title":"boots concept store covent garden london youtube studio beauty hall","story":"Outlet in Covent Garden that has beauty hall and free water tap is part of revamp of chainBoots is opening a concept store featuring a beauty hall with its own YouTube studio as part of one of the biggest makeovers in the retailer’s 170-year history.The health and beauty chain’s new outlet, which will open on Thursday in Covent Garden, central London, is the first of a string of revamped shops to be rolled out by Sebastian James, the Boots managing director.The white marble-tiled beauty hall hosts more than 300 brands, including Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty and the cosmetics label Urban Decay. After browsing and watching live demonstrations, shoppers can take pictures of their purchases in an Instagram zone or conduct video makeovers in the YouTube studio.Boots, keen to promote its green credentials after announcing on Monday that it is phasing out single-use plastic carrier bags in favour of brown paper alternatives, has installed its first water tap where customers can fill up bottles free of charge.James said: “Our new Covent Garden store starts a journey of reinventing Boots for the future. The store is full of exciting beauty brands, ideas for living well and services to help you get better. We will learn what people love and want from this shop, and this will help us shape a blueprint for our whole 2,500-store estate.”On the first floor, pharmacy customers can collect prescriptions from a secure locker, which James said could be located outside stores, as is common in the Netherlands and Germany. Nearby, Boots will display its range of sustainable and health products including eco-friendly sanitary protection, refillable shampoos and products containing CBD, an active ingredient in cannabis.The 28,524 sq ft store is on a site where a Marks \u0026amp Spencer outlet closed last year due to soaring business rates, in a prime central London location where footfall is driven by high tourist numbers as well as local workers.Boots is reviewing its portfolio with the chain’s US parent company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, seeking to cut $1bn (£790m) in costs worldwide.The new store’s general manager, Rob Stewart, said: “This is an unusual location because of the high number of tourists shopping in this area. But we see the project as a test bed and we look forward to hearing from shoppers what they think of the new concepts.”Cardboard advertisements and signs above shelves have been removed to reduce clutter and aisles have been widened.

Sterling had fallen sharply to less than $1.26 against the US dollar and to about €1.12 against the euro. However, the US Federal Reserve coming closer to being forced into cutting interest rates amid fears over a slowing US economy has dampened the strength of the dollar in the past week. This has helped to inflate the value of the pound. The outgoing head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, also suggested that the eurozone requires more economic stimulus, which has sapped the strength of the euro.Mario Draghi using one of his final speeches as ECB president to suggest that interest rates in the eurozone may need to be cut further has helped European equities power ahead over the past month. Increased stimulus can help the stock market to rise, as companies’ borrowing costs are cut. Investors have also become more positive about the chances of a resolution in the US-China trade dispute, after a prolonged period of concern over the standoff between Washington and Beijing. Although rate cuts from the US Fed could suggest a weakening economy, the prospect of stimulus from the US central bank has also lifted markets.After ballooning as companies rushed to import goods to avoid Brexit disruption, the UK’s trade deficit – the shortfall between imports and exports – narrowed to £2.7bn in April from £6.1bn in March. Although suggesting that import and export volumes may be returning to normal, economists said the latest figures could indicate that firms in both the UK and on the continent now have unusually high levels of inventory, meaning they do not need to trade as much as would normally be the case. Export demand has also suffered in recent months amid a broader slowdown in the global economy due to the US-China trade dispute.Surveys of business activity used as early warning signals for the British economy by the Bank of England and the Treasury suggested that UK economic growth remained weak last month. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed that service sector activity, which accounts for four-fifths of the economy, strengthened in May, despite manufacturing and construction slumping into contraction amid heightened levels of uncertainty over Brexit. The IHS MarkitCips services purchasing managers rose to a three-month high of 51 from 50.4 in April, following a rise in domestic orders. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Still, economists warned the pattern of growth remained close to stalling point.Falling corporation tax receipts damaged the health of the public finances in May, which in turn fueled a rise in government borrowing. Public sector net borrowing widened to £5.1bn, about £1bn more than May 2018 and £1bn more than forecast by City economists. It comes as tax and spending decisions are likely to be given to a new chancellor after the Conservative leadership race. Philip Hammond, widely expected to be replaced, has advised the next prime minister to be prudent as Brexit could damage the health of the public finances. However, most of the hopefuls vying to replace Theresa May promised tax cuts and spending increases.The Brexit uncertainty serving as a brake on the housing market appeared to ease last month, as a survey of chartered surveyors showed that prices picked up on relief that the UK hadn’t crashed out of the EU without a deal this spring. A gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors – which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls – improved to -10 from -22 in April. Although the strongest reading since October, analysts warned that concern over Brexit was still holding back some buyers and sellers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db76b28aaba323d64eff74ed91f2a177ff7ca30/0_2748_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd8cda054b31dcd8f8b29b0a591a5be","title":"people think were from another planet meet karachis female cyclists","story":"Teams of women and girls are among numerous cycle groups increasingly to be seen on the streets of the frenetic Pakistan megacityEarly on Sunday morning in Karachi, a group of girls are riding loops around an empty stretch of road outside the colonial-era Custom House. At 6am they left the narrow alleys of the old neighbourhood of Lyari, branded a war zone by national and international media after a lengthy and brutal gang conflict. Two hours later they are still happily pedalling away, in ballet slippers and with headscarves tucked under helmets.“I used to cycle alone,” says Gullu Badar, 15. “It’s nice to cycle here because there’s no danger, no cars. It feels good that there are other girls cycling with me too.”“Don’t you want to take a break?” asks Zulekha Dawood, their instructor from the Lyari Girls Cafe collective. “No,” they shout, and continue chasing each other around.It is rare to see women cycling in Pakistan but scenes like this are increasingly being played out across Karachi on weekend mornings. Numerous cycling groups take over the empty streets, such as the Critical Mass movement. Cycling initiatives have made their way to campuses such as the NED University of Engineering and Technology. There are also sponsored and themed bike rides, including ones to raise awareness of polio, to mark the start of mango season and to honour Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the country’s founder.As cycling becomes more popular, many people are returning to bikes for the first time since childhood. For Aliya Memon, 30, who climbed on a bike last September after a 15-year gap, the memory of how to ride immediately came back. “I started cycling again because it is an emotional outlet,” she says. “You release endorphins when you cycle. You have a sense of achievement.”But it can be difficult in a frenetic city of 15 million. As Karachi has grown from a fishing village to Pakistan’s first capital and now its economic hub, traffic and commute times have increased. Transportation options are dismal.On the city’s dilapidated buses, women squeeze into a cramped reserved section with only a few seats. Sexual harassment is rife onboard and at bus stops, and the limited service forces passengers to walk long distances. For women, the only other options are to share a rickshaw or taxi – an often expensive proposition – or depend on male relatives to drive them to work and school.Cycling could be one way for women to gain personal and economic freedom but it will be a long and bumpy road ahead – quite literally, given Karachi’s potholed streets. For most, cycling is just a recreational weekend activity, not a way to commute. Karachi has no bike paths or cycle parking, and the motor traffic is chaotic. The few cyclists on the roads are mostly daily-wage earners using basic bikes. While some people ride bikes to complete quick errands, the fear of being robbed deters many from cycling to work with a laptop, for example.Deciding there was safety in numbers, they trained indoors for seven months, learning from four women who already knew how to ride a bike. When they had a large enough group, they ventured out on the road.Habiba Allahdad, 39, a resident of Lyari, was hesitant at first, thinking her weight would be an obstacle. Now she hopes she can one day use a bike to run errands: “I want to show people in the neighbourhood that the girls who have this desire in their heart can look at me and do this too.”While there is safety in numbers, many cycling groups rely on support cars and mechanics. Women don’t ride alone on main roads. “When you’re on a bike, you feel a certain sense of freedom,” says Sadaf Furqan, 42, on a Saturday morning after completing a 25km ride with the Cycologists group. But cycling unaccompanied, she says, isn’t an option. “I long for the day I can take my bike and go out on my own but I have to bank on other people to ride. If I go on a long ride, there have to be at least five men in the group.”Nearly every woman interviewed recounts catcalls, stares and harassment. “People think we’ve come from some other planet,” Dawood says.“No matter how progressive people become, if someone is trying something new they cannot tolerate it,” Memon adds. “The ego of our men is very fragile.”Conservatives in Pakistan have been riled by female cyclists. In Peshawar, religious-political parties objected to a cycling rally for women organised by Zamung Jwandun (Our Youth), a local NGO. Wafa Wazir, the group’s 23-year-old founder, had been inspired by accounts of women who wanted to drive rickshaws or ride bikes. As opposition grew, however, Wazir was forced to put the plan on hold, citing the safety of participants.That hasn’t deterred the girls of Lyari, nor any of the women who’ve found cycling offers a release from the stresses of life in Karachi.“They want to scare girls so they don’t go out to cycle, and neither do others,” says Allahdad. “Because if girls ride a bicycle then they can also ride a motorcycle. I think it’s also jealousy at seeing girls getting ahead.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baedcd615e22ec1900a0bb1b9036854ffda7efae/0_0_1555_933/master/1555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cfdc5053715f46d715d83ef5c160676","title":"the guardian view on labour and brexit lead the debate","story":"In their race to become prime minister, the two Conservative leadership candidates are licensing wishful thinking on an industrial scale. Boris Johnson tells Tory members what they want to hear: that a great, new Brexit deal is available and that leaving the EU without any deal is also a viable alternative. His rival, Jeremy Hunt, gets closer to honesty, warning that a no-deal exit would be costly, but he retains it as an option.Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson cannot rule out the most damaging rupture with the EU because many Tories see it as a desirable outcome and the only valid expression of the 2016 referendum result. While their contest dominates the news, the terms of national debate are being skewed. Fanatical Europhobia is exerting a gravitational pull on the whole question of what Brexit means. A campaign to restore balance and sanity to the argument is urgently needed.Labour rejected a no-deal exit long ago and helped orchestrate parliamentary manoeuvres to stop it happening in March. Jeremy Corbyn has often challenged Mrs May to repudiate anti-Brussels extremists within her party. No one can doubt the opposition’s aversion to what Mr Corbyn calls “a damaging Tory Brexit”. But the resistance has limited potency because other aspects of Labour’s European message lack consistency.This saga has been running since the party’s annual conference last year, where policy was codified in a convoluted formula to satisfy those who wanted a second referendum and those who insisted the result of the first one be honoured. That debate flowed from two rival accounts of Labour’s democratic duties: one to its members, the majority of whom want to remain in the EU, and the other to people who voted leave in constituencies represented by Labour MPs.Only some of the pro-Brexit voters in those seats are Labour supporters, but opponents of a referendum argue that the objective should be winning wider support in working-class communities where faith in the party has been in decline since before 2016, and where support for Brexit expresses a cry of economic and social anguish. It is a demand to be heard, say Labour’s pro-leave MPs, and it must be satisfied as a condition for regaining trust.One counter-argument is that Brexit offers no real respite to those people. On the contrary, whatever its form it will inflict more economic pain. Another is that Labour’s bigger ballot box emergency is the flood of remain voters to the Greens and Liberal Democrats.Both sides in this debate can be right. It is an ugly dilemma but that is the nature of Brexit. The simple word “leave” concealed a bundle of painful decisions – on immigration, trade, regulation. Mrs May was destroyed by the impossible choices she faced. It is not surprising Mr Corbyn prefers not to be pinned down. But the cost of ambiguity is diminished relevance. The aspiration to rise above the leave-remain ide is laudable in theory, but in practice it looks like tactical lurking on the margin of the most urgent debate the country has faced for generations. Labour has shifted towards a second referendum in increments while the Tories have taken wild leaps towards ever more extreme notions of Brexit. Labour’s voice has been muffled while Tories compete to see which of them can bellow the worst idea the loudest.Meanwhile, the spectrum of possible outcomes has narrowed. Mr Johnson, Britain’s likely next prime minister, would be propped up by people who relish the chaos of a no-deal exit. The space for a softer, compromise Brexit is vanishing. The definitions have shifted. A “hard Brexit” once meant anything outside the single market. Now Tory hardliners, eyeing up deals with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, define anyone who would preserve regulatory alignment with the EU as a “remainer”. When the default definition of Brexit is a model admired by Mr Farage, it should be clear that Labour is opposed. The trajectory is towards a crunch moment that demands an unambiguous, principled defence of Britain’s strategic, cultural, economic and historical alliance with its European neighbours. Labour is following behind that trend when it could be leading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06b1575a30bb0ad487fdec8d570fbf558ec53dd7/0_250_5616_3368/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2579a99b71f08400609ae624e985eca8","title":"two child benefits limit society inhumanity scroungers","story":"An unforgiveable policy has been normalised by dismissing the families it punishes as ‘scroungers’The study is a brutal insight into this morally bankrupt policy. Nearly all families affected reported going without essentials such as food, medication or heating. Domestic violence victims trying to leave an abusive partner said the cut resulted in “stark choices between poverty and safety” for themselves and their children, while several women said they had been forced to consider abortions of wanted pregnancies. It would be easy to believe this is far removed from the words of a fringe politician like Smith, but the two-child policy is simply the legitimate face of this sort of toxic thinking. From its inception, the child limit has been rooted in class-baiting sexism: a dog whistle that says working-class women are breeding too much, and that their offspring are a drain on the public purse.Ministers billed it as an “incentive” for people on benefits to work, despite official figures showing most families affected already had a job. Iain Duncan Smith claimed it would force people to learn that “children cost money”, as if parents struggling on poverty wages needed this lesson. It wilfully ignored that family planning is rarely clear cut some pregnancies are unplanned, while a job loss or rent hike can quickly change someone’s circumstances after a baby has been conceived. The study found a lack of publicity by the government meant only half the women affected were even aware of the change before they became pregnant.The two-child limit has broken the most fundamental tenet of the welfare state: that there should always be a link between support and need. The government has purposely washed its hands of children in hardship. This is perhaps the most disturbing part. Poverty is not so much a mistaken result of the two-child limit, it is the intended consequence. The attitudes that have allowed this to happen have not come from nowhere but have been normalised for years, from reality shows to tabloid fetishisation of “scrounging” families. Added up, each demand to take benefits from low-income parents has been so effective that it has even managed to dehumanise children – as if working-class babies don’t cry when they’re hungry, or if they do, that their suffering doesn’t matter.By 2024, the two-child limit will have forced an additional 300,000 children into poverty, while 1 million already below the breadline will be pushed into deeper hardship. The only way this will be prevented is if, as a society, we decide their lives matter. “Rabbits” can be easy enough to ignore. Children cannot.• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonization of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffc7ff6eb7fa819ea49c4b98141a1d66405be7d/0_73_3207_1924/master/3207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8112feef74d9141f4a639a9e10b5b72","title":"eyes without a face edith scob","story":"French actor was famed for role as the masked protagonist in the cult classic before resurgence in films such as Holy MotorsÉdith Scob, the French actor best known for her first starring role in the creepy 1960 Georges Franju horror film Eyes Without a Face, has died aged 81. Her agent confirmed the news to AFP, saying she had died on Wednesday in Paris. No cause of death was disclosed.Scob’s role in Eyes Without a Face is one of the great breakout performances in French cinema. Playing the daughter of a surgeon who undergoes extensive skin grafts after her face is disfigured, she spends much of the film swathed in bandages or wearing a mask, only her eyes visible. Scob’s ethereal, expressive qualities made a stunning impact and the film has remained a cult favourite.Modern audiences are more likely to know her for her appearance in Leos Carax’s 2012 film Holy Motors, where she played a limousine driver taking Denis Lavant’s mysterious Oscar to his “appointments”. At the end of the film she dons a mask in homage to her iconic role.Born Édith Scobeltzine in Paris in 1937 into a family of Russian immigrants, Scob studied at the Sorbonne and embarked on a stage career in the late 1950s. She quickly made headway in cinema, and was cast in a small role in Georges Franju’s Head Against the Wall in 1959, before securing her first leading role in Eyes Without a Face. Scob would go on to make three more features with the director, including the 1963 revenge thriller Judex.On screen, Scob worked steadily, with roles in films such as Luis Buñuel’s 1969 film The Milky Way (in which she played the Virgin Mary), Jacques Rivette’s 1994 Jeanne la Pucelle (as Jeanne de Béthune). A resurgence in the late 90s saw her cast in the popular French hit Venus Beauty and Raúl Ruiz’s Proust adaptation Time Regained, both released in 1999. Since the turn of the century she has been nominated for César awards for best supporting actress for Olivier Assayas’ family chamber piece Summer Hours in 2008 and Holy Motors in 2012.Scob maintained a high-profile stage career alongside her film work, with a string of roles in French drama, including Racine, Molière and Anouilh. In 1976 in collaboration with her partner, the composer George Aperghis, she founded the avant garde theatre group Atem (Atelier Théâtre et Musique), designed to involve the disadvantaged in the deprived suburbs of Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec5f79352ee7e10bf867128bf9275eca63fac3d/354_0_1607_964/master/1607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d286373baa809f459025cf2cc24cfc2b","title":"kurier review wladyslaw pasikowski philippe tlokinski","story":"A Polish agent follows a perilous route from London to Warsaw in this taut and arresting piece of storytellingGiven Poland’s nationalist turn under Andrzej Duda, you have to wonder about which audience this doughty but slightly self-pitying second world war spy thriller is meant to serve. Philippe Tłokiński stars as Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, emissary of the Polish government in exile in London struggling to make his way back across Europe to a Warsaw resistance caught between a Nazi rock and a Soviet hard place. The film has a taste for defiant proclamations – “Giving up for the first time in our history will surely break the spirit of this nation!” – that you imagine will put a spring in the step of the new breed of Polish EU-shin-kickers.Perhaps Nowak-Jeziorański is such a prominent war hero in Poland that Pasikowski didn’t think it was necessary to spend much time on his inner character. Beyond a certain klutziness – he doesn’t know how to ride a bicycle when told to escape on one – there isn’t much to break Tłokiński’s indomitable facade, or any clue as to which powers his dogged drive. Kurier, though, has a confident, committed sweep enough to suggest that Pasikowski could capably expand his canvas to war stories outside the Polish purview."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35921f3647af7b49c85f6e9116c2c1c357c61824/0_0_15000_9005/master/15000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c2d53dddaa71086518137c7900323d4","title":"photograph review mumbai romance ritesh batra","story":"The Lunchbox director Ritesh Batra returns with an enigmatic meditation on chance meetings and things unsaidRitesh Batra stole the hearts of moviegoers the world over with his gentle romance The Lunchbox in 2013, and after some uncertain English-language movies he has returned to India with this odd, enigmatic high-concept love story set in Mumbai. Photograph has some beautifully shot moments, and Batra sometimes captures the city with something approaching the rapture with which Wong Kar-wai captures Hong Kong. Yet it is weirdly opaque and internalised, and doesn’t ever really come to life.This is a romance in which the lovers do no more than briefly touch hands. They rarely even smile at each other, and their voices are hardly ever raised higher than a murmur. Photograph is elliptical, so much so that I almost suspect some scenes have been lost in the edit. The plot turns on a photograph that we never see. The lovers meet under extraordinary circumstances that they do not discuss, and their relationship develops by way of dishonesty and imposture with regard to a third party, which never appears to trouble them. Batra has his male character go on a gallant quest to seek out a defunct brand of cola somewhere in the city to give to his loved one because she adored drinking it as a child. Yet we never see him give it to her, never see her drinking it, never see her eyes lighting up at the memory or lighting up at the thought of what this man has done – nothing like that.Rafi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is a struggling street photographer taking snaps of tourists in Mumbai – a tough job when everyone these days can take selfies on their smartphones. Miloni (Sanya Malhotra) is a delicate, unhappy young woman who happens to walk past and he chivvies her into posing for a photo. She appears entranced by the snap he hands her (he can print it by means of a cumbersome, boxy device slung round his neck) and in something of a daze she wanders off without paying. Rafi, too, is mesmerised by how great this photograph is (we, the audience, must take it on trust). As it happens, his revered grandmother Dadi (Farrukh Jaffar) is always nagging him to get married so, on a whim, Rafi sends her this photo, claiming it is of his fiancee.But then his grandmother proposes to come and visit. How is Rafi going to produce this woman in the flesh? Through a bizarre quirk of fate, Rafi sees another very important photograph: a billboard advertising an evening class in accountancy with Miloni at the top as the star pupil. By hanging around outside the school building, Rafi is able to strike up a conversation, tell her what’s happening and persuade her to go along with the deception – although we never see any of that conversation, and the bizarre randomness of it all is accepted by both with a placid calm.All this could be the basis of a Green Card-type romp, or a conventional romantic comedy of some sort. Not here. Comedy is not the point. Photograph is deadpan and restrained – and so are its lead characters, as if they are in sad and timid denial about the implications of what is happening and the passionless nature of the lives they have been leading until now. Miloni never worries about what is happening, even when she accepts valuable jewellery from Dadi as a dowry gift. Is she planning to give it back to Rafi later?For all this, the movie floats calmly and confidently along, with Rafi dealing with his cantankerous gran and Miloni rejecting the dull bore her parents have lined up for her to marry. There is an intriguing scene when Rafi has a conversation with a ghost, played by the veteran Indian character actor Vijay Raaz. With this scene, Batra is perhaps signalling that that his film is not to be judged by realist criteria.It is a curious work, but to some extent saved by the forthright, enjoyable performance of Jaffar as the old woman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d91978539722d13bb8971e10453b1e7772947d91/60_70_3323_1994/master/3323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=496a85da9ab38dc54ece46aa64f6fcbe","title":"aaron wan bissaka manchester united patience tackling energy crystal palace","story":"Manchester United are buying potential in a right-back with great energy and tackling ability but areas to improveThere is no real preparation for what is about to happen to Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Sure, he had been offered a glimpse of what is to come while drawing the focus with that stoppage‑time own goal which condemned England’s under-21s to a damaging defeat by France at the European Championship. Aidy Boothroyd put an uncharacteristically frazzled display that night down to the unsettling nature of the tortuous negotiations over his transfer to Manchester United. In effect, the full-back had been distracted in Cesena.Yet, now that a compromise over a fee has been thrashed out and the youngster from New Addington is about to be confirmed as a United signing in a £45m deal that could rise to £50m, the real scrutiny kicks in. A player with only 46 senior appearances, and a solitary full season with Crystal Palace, will be expected to hit the ground running at United.After all, his purchase has demanded a significant chunk of the money allocated for the revamp of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s backline. The tackles and interceptions which drew warm appreciation at Selhurst Park will suddenly be the bare minimum expected at Old Trafford. Heaven forbid anyone actually succeeds in dribbling past him.Not that anything, to date, has really fazed Wan-Bissaka. He is quiet and unassuming, mature beyond his years and far from flash off the pitch, and those he has left behind are convinced he will have what it takes to thrive in the spotlight. On the field, the 21-year-old is raw. He has established a reputation as a fine tackler, a player who has thrived in one-on-one situations from the moment he was thrust in against Christian Eriksen, Alexis Sánchez and Eden Hazard on his first three senior outings in the spring of 2018. No defender in Europe’s elite leagues came close to matching his 129 tackles last term, earning him the award for player of the year at a club apparently utterly reliant upon Wilfried Zaha.Some of those lunges were born of slight issues in positioning, but a player nicknamed “Spider” boasts telescopic legs and a burst of pace to help extricate himself from trouble of his own making, with those wonderfully quick feet adding to his armoury.“You think you’re past him, but he’s got enough strength to get a last-ditch tackle in from nowhere,” said Zaha, who had been surprised at being relatively nullified by the former winger plucked from the academy building across Copers Cope Road to make up the numbers in training. A standard was set in those early sessions. In 3,135 minutes of Premier League football last season, opponents wriggled past the right-back 10 times.The fact that, among defenders, his tally of 84 interceptions was bettered only by Dijon’s Wesley Lautoa, Armando Izzo of Torino and William of Wolfsburg suggests he is also developing a fine sense of anticipation. That said, a player only recently converted from life more advanced up the flank in Palace’s youth setup has benefited hugely from James Tomkins – so often his closest ally as the right-sided centre‑half – guiding him through testing occasions, whether with reminders of marking duties or retaining team shape. The younger man is not infallible. United and their support must be aware they are buying potential. They will need to be patient at times.Solskjær will have been attracted to his energy. Wan-Bissaka boasts a presence, strong physique and that pace which is such an asset. He will be a threat down the flank, where he will always be an outlet whether those lung-bursting sprints are in possession or in anticipation of a pass.The boyhood Arsenal supporter, who was so prolific in junior football to attract Palace’s scouts when he was 11, has acknowledged he should add goals to his game. “They’re coming, don’t worry,” he offered through a smile when interviewed by the  in February. Back then his priorities were still to build on a promising start to life in the Premier League, though his standards never dipped.A youngster who was never taught how to tackle and was first offered his opportunity with Palace having seen 12 teammates ruled out through injury has become a £45m-plus full-back inside 16 months. His rise has been meteoric. There is no reason to think it will stop now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166e0a38dc427d46a267145a033f84f3d1aaa8f5/910_752_2207_1325/master/2207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d8f24798e9e8b53f5ae08814bcbd265","title":"david moyes manchester united contract end manager old trafford","story":"In the parallel universe of where Manchester United imagined they would be six years ago David Moyes is planning a little party this weekend, inviting a few close friends around to mark the successful completion of his first Old Trafford contract. The manager has long known he would be staying at United for many years more than that – he basically gave himself the right to draw up his own terms in his annus mirabilis season of 2015-16, when he signed Jamie Vardy, won the league and the FA Cup and succeeded in persuading David Gill to return in place of floundering chief executive Ed Woodward. But with last season’s European success against Manchester City still fresh in the memory he thinks it would be appropriate to remind everyone that he was initially offered only a six-year deal.Nothing in football, or any other sphere of human activity for that matter, is as difficult as trying to foresee the future. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United acted from the best of intentions back in 2013, and you could not have told either party at the time that Moyes’s hitherto impressive managerial career would hit the buffers so quickly, taking in relegation at Sunderland and that unfortunate remark to the BBC’s Vicki Sparks, or that four managers later the club would be a bigger joke than it ever was in the decade or so before Ferguson arrived from Scotland.That may seem an unnecessarily cruel conclusion, though one only has to stand outside the present Old Trafford to understand that the club is massively bigger than it was 30 years ago, easily dwarfing anything else in English football. The hapless Woodward takes a lot of flak for sweating United’s various noodle and mattress partners, yet this ignominious but necessary stream of income is precisely what enables the club to put a brave face on financial absurdities such as Alexis Sánchez’s wages or Paul Pogba’s loyalty bonus.When people say “Ole’s at the wheel” in the sniggering way they currently do, the joke is partly based on recognition of the fact that the vehicle the boyish novice is driving is actually a juggernaut theoretically capable of flattening anything in its path. No one wishes Ole Gunnar Solskjær any harm – he is a likable character who initially at least worked like a charm in a tricky situation – though no one expects United to be bothering the top four next season either.Even Woodward must have noticed that Liverpool and City have profited through importing title-winning managers from Germany and Spain, and perhaps more importantly putting recruitment structures in place to facilitate the swift signing of transfer targets. Tottenham have the highly regarded Mauricio Pochettino (highly regarded at Old Trafford as recently as six months ago) and the formidable Daniel Levy. United have the former manager of Molde of the Eliteserien and an alleged vacancy for a director of football, that alleged vacancy for a director of football that the club does not appear to be in any hurry to fill.Ferguson is thought to favour Steve Walsh for the job, despite the soaking the former Leicester scout took in his short stay at Everton, but it remains unclear whether the United hierarchy want anyone else spending their money. Mention of Leicester at least recalls the memory of 2016 and the notion that just about anyone can spring from the most unpromising circumstances, though while the Foxes’ achievement will never be anything less than sensational it was accomplished at a time when the usual top six contenders were in transition or asleep on the job. That will not be happening this season – City, Liverpool and Spurs have arguably never been more alert – and with some key playing departures still possible this summer one imagines Solskjær’s first full season as United manager might be quite painful.Probably not as painful as Moyes’s first full season as United manager though. The former Everton manager never fully won over the players and did not have a hope of commanding the sort of instant respect Ferguson had come to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest mistake United made was simply not realising how much the club had grown in stature in the 27 years of Ferguson’s tenure, and that seeking a 1986 solution to a 2013 problem was always going to be risky, though in fairness none of the more obvious appointments of the past five years have worked out either, with Solskjær unlikely to buck the trend.One hopes Moyes enjoys a drink or two this weekend anyway, perhaps with a wry smile at the way things turned out in a manner that was beyond his control. He could even invite Rafa Benítez to join him, for the two former rivals on Merseyside still have plenty in common despite some stark differences in recent experience. Benítez is reaching the end of his three-year contract at Newcastle and is leaving the club, presumably fed up of not seeing eye to eye with Mike Ashley, if such an expression is appropriate for two people who hardly ever met.Newcastle were in a mess when Benítez took over, and though the club’s future is probably always going to be uncertain under present ownership, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager did an admirable job of restoring viability with limited resources. To a man the players appreciated his input, crowds of 52,000 sang his name and all the love that eluded Moyes in Manchester was present on Tyneside for Benítez, yet Newcastle have still contrived to lose their most popular and effective manager since Sir Bobby Robson.Managers mostly move around though with a few notable exceptions that is the nature of their game and they are paid very well for the occasional inconvenience. It is the owners who stay put, quite often to the despair of a club’s supporters. In an ideal world, or indeed a parallel universe, the introduction of finite contracts at boardroom level would be a welcome development."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0073f6f64593100f05879d298086573131dac032/0_193_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43882906ee60b6604490cf5abbc47ee2","title":"egypt v dr congo africa cup of nations 2019 live","story":"Proof that DR Congo know how to make an entrance ...There’s a hint of Loi-era Koffi Olomide about that arrival (minus the France jerseys, obviously)...Hegazi has overcome his fitness worries and will start in central defence. Salah looks like he’ll start on the right again, with Mohsen in the centre. Amr Warda is notably by his absence from the bench, having been ejected from the squad today for an undisclosed breach of discipline (reference has been made to unwholesome social media exchanges). For the Leopards, the Premier League players Bolasie and Masuaku have been dropped, as has the former Premier LEague player Mbemba. Bolingi, Maghoma and Moke.Hello, welcome, please make yourselves at home. But know that being at home brings its own pressure, especially if you’re an Egyptian footballer. The Pharaohs kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 win over Zimbabwe last Friday and although they showed glimpses of thrilling fluency, their performance left plenty of room for improvement. Even Mohamed Salah fell below the standard demanded, as his attempt to influence that match was frustrated by a combination of strong defending by Divine Lunga and uncharacteristically hefty touches by Salah himself. Egypt’s manager, Javier Aguirre, said Salah arrived a little jaded from his epic season with Liverpool but will grow into this tournament. Let’s hope so, for the sake of the spectacle. He also said Salah may be deployed in a central striking role today, as opposed to on the right wing, where he began against Zimbabwe. If that works, then expect him to fire Egypt towards the victory that will confirm their presence in the last 16.While Egypt fans want to see a little more from their side, supporters of DR Congo must wonder when their team is going to turn up at all. The Leopards were catastrophic in their first outing, deservedly beaten 2-0 by Uganda. It was the worst performance of any team in the tournament so far because they played like a senseless rabble, which was surprising from a team managed by Florent Ibenge. The Congolese collective malfunctioned and so too did their iniduals: while Salah failed to shine for Egypt, Congo’s star player, Cédric Bakambu, stood out for his sheer awfulness. Yannick Bolasie was only marginally better. If the Leopards don’t pull themselves together and harness the talent they clearly possession, they’ll be on their way home real soon. A draw might do for them today – although that would leave them needing to beat Zimbabwe, who took four points off them in qualifying, so a win here would be much better. Ibenge has vowed to attack.

The leaders want a suspension of the ban to allow them to shift enormously valuable stockpiles.There were calls for an end to the international “one size fits all” legislation that, Mnangagwa said, prevents the countries from using proceeds of sales of the animal products to help their conservation efforts.Cites’ rules, which countries and states adhere to voluntarily, prohibit trade in endangered flora and fauna, with varying degrees of protection given to more than 35,000 species.“We are gravely concerned, however, by the one-size-fits-all approach. Banning of trade is creeping into the Cites decision-making processes. We call upon the institution to resist the temptation to be a policing institution but instead to be a developmental organisation to promote conservation communities and sustainable utilisation of all wildlife resources.”He said the sale of ivory would help Zimbabwe maintain good conservation for the next two decades. Botswana’s President Mokgweetsi Masisi, who last month sparked controversy when he lifted the ban on elephant hunting, underscored the need to protect communities who, he said, face unprecedented attacks from wildlife.Mnangagwa said Cites should commend the region for overseeing the growth in elephant population and incentivise conservation by allowing free trade.“Because of our good governance, our animals are now many. But when we say can we use them so that the people who protect them can get good houses, by selling some of the things that ought to be sold so that it benefits the communities … some of them believe that animals have more rights.“… But people whose houses were destroyed by animals want compensation. If we could sell some of this ivory, it would go towards maintaining conservation.”The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) said farmers living near conservation areas had lost more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of crops to straying elephants.A growing human population, meanwhile, has led to people encroaching on game parks and forests.Zimbabwe is developing a policy to limit conflict between humans and wildlife as it moves to ease friction over resources. It also wants to see the Cites ruling relaxed so it can sell more animals. Between 2012 and 2018, Zimbabwe sold 98 elephants, mainly to China.Cites’ secretary general, Ivonne Higuero, said ivory trade would be among the topical issues for discussion at the conference in August.She also said, however, that African countries were ided on the sale of ivory, with a coalition led by Kenya pushing for Cites to maintain the embargo.This counter proposal, according to Higuero, seeks to place southern African elephants in Appendix I of Cites, which identifies species that are the most endangered among its listed animals and plants.“As secretary general and hearing these proposals, I must say it is time that there was an open discussion about these issues … Countries want to have this on the table.”Max Graham, CEO of Space for Giants, which has launched a report showing the potential for growth in Africa’s nature-based tourism, said the continent could utilise tourism as an alternative to wildlife trade.“There are many alternatives that can earn Africa’s governments and its people rewards from their wildlife, while also protecting that wildlife. We would point to the huge opportunity tourism offers: it’s growing faster in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else, and visitor numbers could double by 2030,” Graham said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34241d7a958a24bc0a52be6a3ba502580b55aae8/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29099b8b43e65da8f49d78a88564c97f","title":"tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you","story":"As part of a series exploring how one change can make a profound personal impact, we want to hear from youWhat is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing?

I’m shocked. She has no respect,” tweeted one user in Japanese.“I like Kim Kardashian, but please pick a name other than Kimono if it’s underwear,” wrote another.In Japanese the word kimono means “something to wear”, while Kardashian West’s use of it appears to be a play on her first name. The clothing line’s website offered no explanation for the choice of name, though the post included a series of photos from the brand with a caption stating the brand has been 15 years in the works.⁣Not everyone was opposed to the name, with some arguing it could offer a chance to promote a traditional outfit that is declining in popularity in Japan. Once a standard of the Japanese wardrobe, the kimono is now often reserved for special occasions such as weddings and coming-of-age ceremonies and is mostly worn by women.While the elaborate traditional outfits might appear to have little in common with the second-skin items in Kardashian West’s clothing line, kimonos are often hugely expensive and are also known for being hard to wear. Women sometimes hire experts to help them to dress in kimonos because the outfit requires seemingly endless nipping, tucking and strapping.The Kimono line is not the only surprise the 38-year-old star has sprung on fans this year, ranging from unexpected additions to her family to pursuing a legal career and dabbling in politics.In May, she and her husband, Kanye West, shared photographs of their newborn son, Psalm, born via surrogate. Kardashian West already has three children with West: Chicago, 16 months North, six years old and Saint, aged three.In an interview published in the April issue of US Vogue, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star revealed she is studying to become a lawyer. Four US states, including California, offer a path to qualification by what is known as “reading the law”, or apprenticing with a practicing lawyer or judge.Since last July Kardashian West has been logging the required 18 hours of weekly supervised study with two mentoring lawyers. Nor has the world of politics escaped Kardashian West’s attention. A year ago, Donald Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman serving a life sentence in prison without parole for a first-time drug offense, after she brought up Johnson’s case during a meeting with the president at the White House.Kardashian had apparently partnered with Jared Kushner, who has advocated for sentencing reform for nonviolent offenders, to try to convince Trump to pardon Johnson.But there maybe other motives too: West announced his ambition to become US president at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. West repeated that plan last September, saying he is serious about a presidential bid in 2024. “If I decide to do it, it will be done, I’m not going to try,” the rapper and fashion designer told Chicago’s DJ Pharris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692ec1ffe4d99d74a178ac1b54b5207b08579619/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=737c36e631065adf3c95df394f3ca3bf","title":"no scorpios no meat eaters rise of extreme flatsharing ads","story":"It’s a landlords’ market these days, which means Generation Rent has to abide by some frankly bizarre stipulationsThe two-bedroom flat in Turnpike Lane, north London, seemed run-of-the-mill. Laura Evelyn, an actor looking for a new place to stay, didn’t like the decor particularly – the fake leather sofa and glass dining table weren’t to her taste – but her would-be landlord was friendly enough. But as she was leaving the viewing, the owner handed her a sheet of paper. When Evelyn read it, she was flabbergasted.It contained a list of 31 rules that Evelyn, aged 35, would be expected to abide by if she moved in. Showers couldn’t last longer than 15 minutes. She was allowed two visitors a month, who must be approved two weeks in advance. After eating, she must wash up, and immediately return to her room. And if she left dishes in the sink, she’d be charged £15 a pop.Most people are used to abiding by rules – and good manners – when cohabiting with others. Have sex quietly, don’t hog the bathroom and never microwave mackerel, unless you are a monster. But, in effect, what Evelyn’s would-be landlord wanted wasn’t a flatmate he just wanted her to pay his mortgage and disappear.This is an egregious example of the worst inequalities of the housing crisis, but also not as unusual as you may think. Browse Spareroom or Gumtree, and you will see similarly extreme housemate adverts. There was the £650-a-month London flatshare where tenants were forbidden from Skyping their family in the evening. There are the rogue landlords who offer to waive rent, in exchange for sex. Then there are the lighthearted ones. Are you a postgraduate student looking for a double room to let in Brixton? Come this way – provided you aren’t an anthropologist. (Sociologists and social psychologists are welcome.)What these adverts reflect is that Britain is going back to being a nation of renters. Home ownership levels have plunged, with a quarter of UK households expected to rent privately by the end of 2021. In 2017, British tenants paid a record £50bn in rent. Young adults form “Generation Rent”, with homeownership a distant dream for those professionals on average incomes but without the large deposits needed to get on to the housing ladder.The night before I speak to a 28-year-old PR worker who lives in north-east London, she ate sweets for dinner in her bedroom. Why? Because she finds her live-in landlord’s rules so restrictive that she avoids communal areas such as the kitchen. She is expected to abide by a checklist taped to the back of the front door, which insists that hair straighteners are turned off, and lists the various doors, windows and skylights that must be locked prior to leaving. In the bathroom, her other housemate stuck a note to the mirror, requiring all spittle to be wiped away immediately. “The level of micromanaging … it’s madness,” she says. Her landlord even installed a smart plug on her hair straighteners, which she remotely controls via her phone. She wants to leave, but moving house is expensive and her £600-a-month budget is low, meaning that she is stuck for now. Her mental health has deteriorated. “You’re always stressed,” she says. “You think: ‘If I see her, is she going to complain about something?’”Expecting prospective tenants to live under a quasi-feudal regime reflects the power wielded by landlords in our property-centric society. “These restrictive ads amply underline the extent to which power, like wealth, is concentrated in the hands of landlords,” says Portia Msimang of the pressure group Renters Rights London. “Some people get overexcited by that power.” Some of these restrictions may even be illegal, she points out. “The renter would have a very strong defence against any attempt at eviction on the basis of breach of unfair terms.” But without root-and-branch reform of the UK’s housing provision, such behaviour seems likely to continue. And it’s not just landlords who have the power. Existing tenants of desirable houseshares can afford to be choosy about who they live with, screening candidates on everything from their dietary preferences to their political beliefs or their star signs. (Unlike gender or sexual orientation, these are not protected characteristics under the law, and so these stipulations aren’t illegal.)Which is bad news for Capricorns. In April, a New York City housing advert went viral after a prospective applicant was rejected for belonging to that star sign. Megan, a 24-year-old from Brighton, thinks that the no-Capricorn advert is ridiculous because, in her experience, Capricorns make perfectly good housemates. It’s Cancers you need to watch out for. “I had a housemate who was a Cancer, and it wasn’t good for either of us.” A Gemini, Megan’s preference would be to live with Leos, Taureans or Capricorns. She would ban Cancers from moving into her house should a room become available – and probably also Scorpios, if she’s being honest. “It’s like, how many more emotional Cancers or Scorpios will I live with, before I acknowledge it’s not meant to be?”There can be darker factors at work: a 2018  investigation found that people from ethnic minorities face discrimination when looking for houseshares. For every 10 positive replies to an inquiry about a room for rent sent by a prospective renter called “David”, inquiries from a “Muhammad” received only eight. Sometimes, racism is coded more overtly: the writer and director Yero Timi-Biu recently made headlines after she posted a text exchange with a landlord asking where her parents were from and it went viral. “Where demand for accommodation outstrips supply, landlords, agents and other renters can pick and choose,” says Msimang. “If they’re bigoted people, they pick and choose in line with their bigotry.”But houseshare ads can exclude certain groups of people for more understandable reasons. Clare is 33 and advertising a spare bedroom in her house in east London. Prospective housemates must not eat meat in the house, as Clare and her flatmates are vegetarians or vegans. “I find meat really unsettling,” she says. “Where people see food, I see something dead.” If someone moved in and then started eating meat, she’d probably ask them to leave, she says.LGBT-only houseshare adverts are also common. For many queer people, they are necessary to create a home in which they feel safe. Jender Anomie, a 27-year-old artist from Bexhill in East Sussex, would prefer to live with fellow queer people. “I’m sure this is the same of many marginalised groups,” Anomie says. “Living with heterosexual people can be really trying, and it seems unnecessary suffering if you have access to another, more welcoming type of living space.”At their heart, many housemate adverts are about looking for like-minded people. But you can overegg it. In 2014, Henry Blanchard, a young entrepreneur, posted an advert looking for flatmates to “come and join us in ‘Reinventing Living’”, and thereby inadvertently spoofed the toe-curling excesses of the Silicon Valley tech-bro culture. (“Do you believe in passion, integrity, positivity and working smarter, not harder? … Picture the scene – waking up at 6 every morning for a group run or yoga with the house.”)Looking back on the ad now, the 33-year-old cringes. “I was in this startup bubble … I think the house ad was a reflection of that. I wanted to bring my work into every part of my life.” Blanchard did manage to find “like-minded creators” willing to move into his #disruptive houseshare, but they never secured a suitable property. It’s probably for the best. “I had this idealised version of what I thought my life should look like.” What would he think if he saw that advert now? Blanchard laughs. “I would think: ‘I hope it works out for you.’”The best houseshare adverts use humour to make serious points. Travis Nemmer’s 2017 advert for a flatmate in Washington DC went viral after the 27-year-old attorney laid his political cards on the table. “I am a Republican, who will occasionally say nice things about our president. If that’s a dealbreaker, I assure you that you will have no trouble finding some kinda commune.” Nemmer says he didn’t want anyone to be “blindsided” by his political views, given that DC is a fiercely liberal city. The person who moved in was leftwing, so the advert worked. “I wouldn’t say people didn’t want to live with me because I’m a conservative. I don’t have any problems getting along with people regardless of politics. They probably don’t want to live with me because I’m messy.”Williams is, perhaps, also a victim of the housing crisis. He is disabled and struggles to find accessible rental properties – which meant that when he found the property, he agreed to be the lead tenant, responsible for its entire monthly rent. Luckily, he found someone to take the room “She got the humour,” he says. But he probably wouldn’t go down the same route again. “This one didn’t quite hit the nail on the head.”At the housing crisis continues to escalate, more of us will be forced to live with strangers well into adulthood. “I’m too old to be flatsharing,” says the PR worker. “I shouldn’t have to do it. I’m tired of doing it.” These adverts tell stories of exploitation and abuse: greedy landlords infringing their tenant’s fundamental rights in ways that are possibly illegal.But it’s not always bad. The authors are often just searching for common ground with the people who will share their homes – whether it’s with a fellow astrology-lover, a vegan or someone who also gets what it’s like to be marginalised. For Anomie, living in queer spaces gives her access to “unconditional love and understanding”. These adverts are about more than whether you are a Capricorn or vegan, a conservative or a growth hacker. They’re about people, just trying to get along."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5679a6f1f1f36d441eedc13eec2977d22905fe9/0_274_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=447e5f0a9058e25519a0f7f022bcd318","title":"carrie underwood interview glastonbury","story":"As she prepares to take Glastonbury by storm, the country star opens a bottle of red wine and talks about the personal tragedy that coloured her new songsSaturday night on the banks of the Ohio River, and the most American of scenes is unfolding. At the Ball Park, the Cincinnati Reds are playing the Texas Rangers, while at the US Bank Arena next door Carrie Underwood is making the latest stop on her global tour. Fans spill together through the muggy streets, a mingling of scarlet baseball jerseys and tan cowboy boots.This is Underwood’s first tour since 2016, a huge two-hour, 60-date monolith of a show in support of last year’s album Cry Pretty. Reaching UK arenas on Friday, it features a hydraulic stage, multiple costume changes and fearsome pyrotechnics, and it will carry her from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Detroit, Michigan, via the Glastonbury festival this weekend.The most successful winner of American Idol, triumphing in the TV talent show’s fourth season in 2005, Underwood has since recorded six albums, sold over 65m records, won seven Grammys, and earned more than $83m (£65m). She is beautiful and blonde, and married to a retired ice hockey player: at first glance an unlikely addition to the Worthy Farm lineup.When we meet backstage after the show she is out of her costume but still in her stage makeup – teary glitter circles smudged beneath her eyes. “I got us wine!” she announces from the sofa, pouring a large glass of cabernet sauvignon. “This is actually a treat for me because normally I go straight to my bus, and I have a crying baby.” Underwood’s second son, Jacob, was born in January, and now he, her four-year-old, Isaiah, and her husband, Mike Fisher, have joined her on tour. “I actually kicked my husband out of the bed and he sleeps on the couch up front,” she says of their onboard sleeping arrangements. “It’s just a lot easier to wake up in a moving bus and grab the baby and feed him.” She says she has puzzled over how to adapt her set for Glastonbury, deciding to largely play the hits, “try to keep it eclectic” and perhaps bust out an Aerosmith cover.It must be a strange time for such a quintessentially American artist to be visiting the wider world, especially one who is white, southern and religious. “I feel like more people try to pin me places politically,” she says carefully. “I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It’s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it’s black and white. And it’s not like that.”She cites as an example the reaction to her recent single The Bullet, which looked at the long-running emotional impact of a shooting death. “Immediately people said ‘Oh you have a song about gun control!’” she sighs. “It was more about the lives that were changed by something terrible happening. And it does kind of bug me when people take a song, or take something I said and try to pigeonhole or force me to pick a side or something. It’s a discussion – a long discussion.”She grew up in small-town Oklahoma, where like most families they kept guns under the bed. “We had one stop light, one school,” she recalls. “Choir, band, football, basketball and baseball.” Her parents, a teacher and paper-mill worker, drove her to other small towns in a homemade costume to compete in talent shows. “The savings bond I would win wouldn’t cover whatever we spent on gas to get there,” she remembers.When she was 15, she landed a development deal with a record company and got to record in Nashville, though it came to nothing. “I just got my braces off, my acne had cleared up decently … but we had no idea what we were doing,” she says of herself and her band. She went to college to study communications, joined a theatre group and found for the first time in her life a feeling that “this is a safe place, we can sing and it’s OK here”. Apart from the out-of-town talent shows, she had largely kept her voice to herself. “I was more guarded with singing anywhere near where I grew up,” she explains. “It’s that fear thing: what will ‘they’ say? What if ‘they’ laugh at me?”In 2005 she used her parents’ dial-up internet to register for American Idol. “I thought: why not?” she explains. “Because then I figured at least the door will be shut and I could stop wondering. I could stop thinking ‘what if?’ And then I could just come home, and graduate and get a job.”I wonder whether, performing before thousands of people in vast arenas, she still worries about what ‘they’ might think when she’s singing. “A lot of times I feel like I’m alone,” she says. “I’m obviously aware of people being around me. But it’s like I’m in the song alone on stage.” It is a good place. “I like to be alone. My husband is probably the only person this planet I could’ve married – my mom, when I told her I was engaged, was even like ‘I just never really thought you’d get married.’ And so I feel like when I’m alone and singing and I hear nothing but music, it’s a nice place to be.”A recent study found that lately country music has moved away from its familiar subjects of hardship and heartbreak towards party songs. “There’s a lot of songs that aren’t actually saying too much,” she says. “Fun songs to listen along to party vibe.” She pauses. “It makes my skin crawl when I hear somebody say ‘Gurrrl’ in a song, you know?”Underwood prefers the traditional themes: the woman wronged, the sorrow worn. She will stand looking immaculate in a pretty frock, singing about hard times, being cheated on, drinking, messing up her unfaithful’s car. “I hope people know you gotta have a little crazy in ya!” she laughs. “I’ve got long blond hair and I like glitter … But there’s a little crazy in there, and I like that to come out every once in a while. I went through a phase where I killed a lot of people” – she mentions the Blown Away album in which the body count included Cupid hunted down with a shotgun and an alcoholic father taken out by a tornado. “I have no idea why, but I wanted everything to be cinematic and dramatic. This album, things were a little more on the emotional side.”Last autumn, as she launched Cry Pretty, she spoke openly of the experience of suffering three miscarriages in the course of two years, and how that loss coloured many of the new songs, capturing the time when “I was still trying to do my job and put on a smiley happy face and be Carrie Underwood. And then I’d go home and fall apart.”The response to her speaking openly about miscarriage has been deeply moving. “It’s something that people don’t really talk about,” she says. “Even people who are my friends and I know well, after I talked about it were like, ‘My gosh, me too!’ And I feel like it’s something I should’ve known about them.”She takes a moment. “I think you feel silly being so attached to something that you knew about for this long,” she says, and holds up her fingers a short distance apart. “But I still feel it, you know. I mean it took me a while to be able to sing certain songs and be able to get through them without really going there. It doesn’t go away. Ever.”Today she finds singing songs such as Cry Pretty and Low “difficult” but “therapeutic”. “I guess you wait for things to stop hurting at some point,” she says gently. “But letting yourself go there ... other people that are going through the same thing, it kind of connects you to them. I will always mourn those children, those lives that were a shooting star, a breath of smoke, but I have Jacob, and he is incredible, he is the sweetest little baby. At the time it was awful, and it still hurts, but it’s kind of like OK, I have this.”Underwood’s producer, David Garcia, says the number one question she gets asked is whether or not she genuinely writes songs, “or does she just show up and Instagram the whole time?” Underwood not only writes, she also co-produced this record — an anomaly in the male-dominated world of country music. “I mean, I get it: if you were a songwriter in Nashville, and 90-plus per cent of artists are male, are you going to go into your writing session and write a song for a woman?”She looks resolute. “It doesn’t bother me,” she says. “I’ll do it myself.” She pours one last glass before she heads to the bus and the crying baby. “But we do it all. In high heels. I’ll be waking up at God knows what time in the morning feeding my baby – no one else can do that, and I’m proud of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cffed6506b66baf16d7742acb2c8c863b2e767e/0_0_4500_2885/master/4500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e368053e46f35028d847b43400b524 480w","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

It would stop the government being able to consume resources and spend cash if it pursued a no-deal Brexit policy.Another is the possibility of amending some likely emergency government legislation on Northern Ireland power-sharing, which may appear on Wednesday. understands the government is considering introducing an emergency bill next week, to extend the powers civil servants have effectively to govern in Northern Ireland, while the power-sharing assembly continues to be suspended.Parliamentarians who have discussed the plan are concerned about whether an anti no-deal amendment would be ruled outside the scope of the legislation – but hope they will be aided by the willingness of the Speaker, John Bercow, to bend the rules. However, it is not yet certain to be brought forward.Bercow said in a speech in Washington last month, “the idea that parliament is going to … be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.”Labour narrowly failed in a recent bid to commandeer the parliamentary timetable for a day, to pave the way for a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit.But a plan led by Conservative backbenchers might have more hope of securing the support of Tory rebels, than one initiated by Jeremy Corbyn and the other opposition leaders.Passing an amendment would also be a less drastic option than voting to bring down the government.Several Conservative MPs, including Ken Clarke and Grieve, have said publicly in recent days that they would consider supporting Labour in a motion of no confidence against the government, if they believed a no-deal Brexit was imminent.Their fears have been raised by increasingly hard Brexit rhetoric from Johnson, who has the backing of key figures in the European research group (ERG), which is urging him to deliver Brexit by Halloween, even if that means leaving without a deal.Corbyn has not ruled out tabling a no-confidence vote in the narrow window between the new prime minister being appointed, on Wednesday 24 July, and the House of Commons rising for its summer recess the next day.The Labour leader’s spokesman said on Wednesday they would table such a motion when they believe it has the most chance of success.Supporting Labour in bringing down the government would be a dramatic decision for Conservative MPs, however, who would thereby effectively be resigning from their party.Under the fixed-term parliament act, if the government loses a formal motion of no confidence, there is then a fortnight-long period in which alternative candidates can try to assemble a governing majority.If they fail to do so, a general election is triggered. Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested a government of national unity could emerge in those 14 days, perhaps led by a Labour backbencher such as Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn.Philip Lee, a backbench Conservative MP, told the BBC’s World at One that pro-European Conservatives like himself had to be as “ruthless” as the ERG as they seek to stop a no-deal Brexit, which was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit.“Nobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that … But ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table,” he said.“I’ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. And it’s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb4819ce2b1adabead396714691d4614675f81a/0_1700_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0a4f309df08abac03c7773359a3729","title":"yvette cooper or hilary benn should lead unity government to halt brexit ed davey","story":"Lib Dem leadership contender suggests his party could back ‘extreme option’ to stop no dealThe Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested his party could back Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn as head of a government of national unity, to be installed instead of a general election if the government lost a no-confidence vote.The Lib Dem contender admitted he had not spoken to Cooper or Benn about the plan and said the unity government’s sole purpose would be to oversee a second referendum and then dissolve parliament and hold a general election.Davey said the plan would “take some persuasion” but could be a way to attract Conservatives to vote down their own government if they were wary of their actions leading to Jeremy Corbyn winning an election.Cooper, who has been at the forefront of cross-party efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit, has never endorsed a second referendum.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Speaking to journalists at a hustings with his Lib Dem leadership rival Jo Swinson, Davey said it was an “extreme option” and said he had not done the numbers.“I think it has to be a Labour MP because most MPs supporting the Queen’s speech in this government of national unity would be Labour. Ultimately, it’s a challenge to my Labour colleagues,” he said.“I’ve not held talks, I’ve not done a tally. The last time we held an indicative vote for a people’s vote we had 280 people voting for that. I’m as confident as I can be there are six cabinet ministers who would have voted for that, as well as junior ministers. We would need some Tories to come over … I think they are there.”During the hustings, both Swinson and Davey said they were confident about the possibility of new MPs joining the party, after Chuka Umunna joined the Lib Dems.“I have and will continue to have private conversations,” Swinson said. “I’m keen to grow the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party in a variety of ways.”Davey named Heidi Allen, the former Tory MP who briefly joined and then left Change UK, as one MP he had been in talks with.“I have talked to Heidi, I am very happy for them to join, and having listened to them and heard their positions on Europe and other issues, they would fit well in our party,” he said of Allen and of her former Change UK and Tory colleague Sarah Wollaston.“We have to show we are a successful party really going places, they can afford to join us and hold their seats, then we can see quite a lot of people going our way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d92a73be140f99ba20a89c1124721957443ad46/0_0_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29cea8e7e80c90fac7ef512c522167b2","title":"can my choices really make a difference to the environment","story":"Do our actions have a real impact on the future of the planet, or are our environmental efforts just a drop in the ocean?  Anna Turns considers how our lifestyle choices contribute to the bigger picture This summer, my family and I will take the ferry to France instead of flying off to warmer climes. We eat much less meat nowadays and we’re saving to buy an electric car. But in the midst of a worldwide climate crisis, can my choices really make a difference?The short answer is: of course. The view that the choices we make as consumers don’t affect our planet’s health is increasingly considered both untrue and irresponsible take the plastic bag charge or the rollout of smart meters, for example. Both rely on seemingly small adjustments to everyday life that, when enacted en masse, lead to something greater: the plastic bag charge has greatly reduced plastic waste, whereas smart meters help to make the energy grid more responsive. Both signal a seachange in how we’re engaging with the climate crisis.This is crucial, says Armistead, because “our actions make the most impact when recognised by those in power as a demand for further action – when our small actions help open up the political space for greater action.”Alice Bell, co-director of charity 10:10 Climate Action, agrees that we have to act socially to cut carbon emissions. “We all have a part to play in changing our culture,” she says. Take cutting down flying: we can amplify our efforts by talking about our decision, sharing images on social media of the train journey we have taken instead doing what we can to create a cultural shift. Consider Greta Thunberg. Last August, the Swedish schoolgirl began a school strike to demand action on climate change – in March this year, 1.6 million young people around the globe followed suit. “It was a social act,” says Bell. “She sat in a public place, she wrote a sign so people would engage and she spoke about what she was doing.”So while we can all be catalysts for change, we don’t exist in a vacuum we are part of a complex ecosystem – and so advocacy is key. “If we want to make the changes we need, at the speed we need to do it,” says Bell, “we have to be clever about how change happens.” For Bell, that means a simultaneous bottom-up, top-down approach: making inidual efforts while pressuring governments to make large-scale legislative change.Cardiff University’s Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, who has spent the past five years working on the Low Carbon Lifestyles and Behavioural Spillover programme, agrees: “Policymakers don’t feel they have the mandate to take ambitious action unless there’s grassroots demand for it. Equally, a top-down approach makes it easier for everybody to do things substantially differently.”Studying 7,000 people across seven countries, Whitmarsh explored the idea that taking up one eco-behaviour, such as recycling, may lead to another, such as eating less meat. The report concluded that any spillover depends on motivation: if a person wants to make that first shift, they’re more likely to make further positive changes than if told to do so. Crucially, spillover only occurs when the similarities between behaviours are recognised as all contributing to a low-carbon lifestyle. Hence the importance of both advocacy and reinforcing positive social norms.While the report acknowledges that no lifestyle is identical, and not all changes are possible, it highlights five key “behaviours” that can be adopted when working towards a low-carbon lifestyle. Civic action and political engagement is key, but four other everyday areas are also emphasised: transport, at best living car-free and avoiding air travel diet, cutting down meat and dairy “investment decisions”, such as opting for energy-efficient appliances and household energy choices, including installing intelligent thermostats and smart meters.It takes, therefore, a myriad approach for change to reach a tipping point. Just as attitudes towards smoking changed, there’s been a shift in opinion towards electric vehicles (EVs). In the Norwegian capital, Oslo, a combination of government policy – from VAT exemption to fast-charging stations – and municipal initiatives such as free parking and access to bus lanes – means that every third new car sold is battery powered.We all want to make big changes to help our planet, but sometimes to make big changes, we have to start small.

Can the UK’s energy system be decarbonised by 2050? Here’s what we knowThis June, the UK government committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – making it the first major economy and G7 member to do so. But what does that mean? And how are they planning on getting there? The integration of renewable energy sources is key, for starters, and a lot needs to happen to the way we produce, supply and store energy. From the stats on our increasing reliance on the “right” energy sources, and a look at how we’re changing our lifestyles for the better, to what might stand in our way, these are our energy facts and figures as they stand.Electricity Transmission owns and runs the network of cables and transformers within the National Grid. It transmits electricity from power stations to homes, schools, hospitals, factories and other places. The network consists of 4,474 miles of overhead line, 969 miles of underground cable and 346 substations.Eleven further connections linking the UK to other European countries are also planned or under construction (including the 450-mile long North Sea Link to tap into Norway’s hydropower, and the 470-mile long Viking Link to harness energy from Denmark’s wind farms), which could meet a fifth of the UK’s electricity needs by 2025.Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)Coal consumption has fallen from 157m tonnes in 1970 to 11.8m tonnes in 2018, and the UK’s seven remaining coal power stations are set to close by 2025. In May this year the UK also went 18 days without burning coal to generate energy – the longest streak the country has managed since 1882.A third of the UK’s electricity generation came from renewables in the third quarter of 2018 – a new record. That percentage is likely to go even higher: the government hopes that offshore windfarms alone will provide a third of our electricity by 2030 – with the number of jobs in offshore wind potentially tripling to 27,000 in that period.What will be the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, Hornsea One – 75 miles off the Yorkshire coast – is also due to be completed in 2020. It will cover an area five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, and the 174 turbines – each taller than London’s Gherkin building – will be capable of powering 1m homes. In times of peak demand, the smarter energy network will also help to better integrate energy from offshore wind.Source: Committee on Climate Change  Energy Saving TrustAccording to independent government advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, which campaigned for the government’s net-zero commitment, the foundations are already in place to achieve that goal, including initiatives such as increased tree planting and reducing emissions on farms.Source: Committee on Climate ChangePart of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy grid more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources. Of course, smart meters can’t help Britain meet its carbon emissions targets on their own but, with the smarter, more energy efficient grid they help to create, they are a start.

However, in the under 50s, this trend appeared to be largely accounted for by the age of the man’s female partner.The success rates were looked at retrospectively, meaning the scientists could not be sure that the men represented a random sample and the study did not take into account lifestyle factors such as weight, smoking or drinking, which could also influence outcomes independently of age. However, the scientists did find indications that sperm quality was worse in the older men.Previous research has suggested that sperm in older men has more DNA damage and that there is a slightly increased risk of older men fathering children with genetic disorders.“Our data certainly support the importance of educating men about their fertility and the risks of delaying fatherhood,” said Morris.Prof Ying Cheong, honorary consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at the University of Southampton, said: “This study again highlights that men are not immune to the impact of biological ageing as far as their fertility is concerned, although this detrimental impact arrives later than women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a59f596ed744d570ebbe4b1e0c1a91d1280deddb/209_64_3291_1975/master/3291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a59669462b073e18324765cc909ccb","title":"eoin morgan ultimate test england cricket world cup","story":"Captain needs to rally his team with their semi-final hopes in the balance leading up to games against India and New ZealandNow it is getting tense in the England camp. They cannot afford many more mishaps. In fact they may not have room for any if they are to ensure that the goal of World Cup glory on home soil, which has been targeted for so long, does not become another pipe dream.Here comes the ultimate test of Eoin Morgan and there is every reason for him to be disgruntled just at the moment. In the wake of two defeats in the past week, the first of which against Sri Lanka being the most exasperating and unexpected, there is now the piercing observations of former colleagues. Kevin Pietersen, an old supporter of England’s one-day international captain, tweeted: “Eoin Morgan looked scared. That is a horror sign,” after watching him bat against Mitchell Starc. To note that a batsman is “out of form” or “technically deficient” is fine but to suggest that he is “scared” truly stings. Morgan had to be at his iciest to shrug that off after the game at Lord’s.Of greater concern for Morgan is the urgency for his side to win both their remaining games, against India on Sunday at Edgbaston and New Zealand the following Wednesday in Chester-le-Street. They may as well acknowledge that the situation is tricky. Self-denial does not work but nor does self-flagellation. So far his players have reacted badly in tight situations yet they still have the capacity to win even against the best sides.Morgan has begun that process by referring to a loss of confidence in the camp. The protestations that these matches are no different to ordinary ODIs are disappearing so too are the assertions of how much they love to chase – it certainly seems that they do not relish chasing targets of less than 300. World Cup matches are different and over the past four years it has been tough to replicate the extra tension as England zipped up the rankings.There has been some sloppy thinking out on the field in this World Cup. The pursuit of 233 runs to beat Sri Lanka was slapdash and ill-constructed at Headingley at Lord’s they seemed surprised by the introduction of Jason Behrendorff in what proved an inspired move by Australia. When Morgan says: “We have struggled with the basics of what we call our batting mantra,” he is starting to sound like Miranda’s mum. Yes, England must bat “in partnerships” but that is as obvious as craving an end to world poverty climate changeThe Hundred.They would never cite this as an excuse, which is the wise course, but some of the surfaces have not helped England greatly. Half a dozen years ago in the bad old days England’s ODI team were still quite serviceable when playing at home on bowler-friendly pitches. They had craggy batsmen and wily bowlers which meant that 260 could often be a satisfactory total.The current side has proved to be dominant on very flat batting pitches.England have batsmen who can scorch the turf with their drives or pepper the spectators in the stands and a batch of resilient bowlers when the conditions deter the ball from moving. As a consequence they have prospered in high-scoring matches. But when there is some spice in the pitch and batting becomes a more technical, cerebral exercise there are disturbing signs of vulnerability. There was some assistance for the bowlers at Headingley and Lord’s and on both occasions England’s top-order faltered.Consequently Jason Roy has suddenly become a totemic figure. Life was so much simpler when he was in the team. England were thrashing Bangladesh, thanks to his majestic 15, and West Indies in the match that he picked up his hamstring injury. Since then they have defeated only Afghanistan and Roy’s replacement, James Vince, has scored 40 runs in three innings.The hierarchy has been adamant that they will not bring Roy back until he’s properly fit, which is the correct stance to take. But they are now aching for his return. As a batsman he is not necessarily a reassuring figure given his aggressive approach he can easily fail, but they all know now that when he comes off he can change the course of the game. No such confidence emanates from the presence of Vince at the top of the order even if he always times the ball so sweetly prior to departure. Hence they may be tempted to turn a blind eye to Roy’s restricted movement in the field come Sunday.If Roy is unfit for the match against India there may still be an inclination to drop Vince. But there is a snag here. There are no other specialist batsmen in the squad. So unless Joe Root opens the batting and everyone moves up a notch Vince will surely retain his place in the absence of Roy.By this stage of the tournament England were hoping to have the freedom to juggle their pace attack but given their predicament they were not inclined to do so against Australia. So Jofra Archer played at Lord’s despite experiencing some stiffness in his left side before the game and he was not quite at his best. He is due a rest but is now deemed such an integral part of the attack that they may not dare to leave him out. That was not part of the plan four weeks ago.So Morgan faces tough opponents and tough choices throughout a momentous week, which will decide whether his side reaches the semi-finals and may well dictate his reputation as an England captain. We remember World Cup winners rather than being No 1 in the rankings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b665acb3266c7af1b2137de377b8d3686fed326/0_245_3796_2278/master/3796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b5b0c6a6c80dbd588eb85075c58f3dc","title":"new zealand pakistan cricket world cup match report","story":"Pakistan are making a late surge in the direction of the World Cup’s semi‑final spots, with the winds of their victorious 1992 campaign possibly behind them once more if the form book is anything to go by.In defeating New Zealand by six wickets at Edgbaston – where the atmosphere evoked a match in Lahore or Karachi – they have continued a run of results that has so far matched Imran Khan’s Cornered Tigers game for game (including a washout).Now with seven points in the bag, and games against Afghanistan and Bangladesh to come, Sarfaraz Ahmed’s current generation look as poised as any to pounce should fourth-placed England, sitting on eight, fail to chalk up wins from their remaining two games.Here, as a sea of green supporters roared them on and local seismologists probably stared quizzically at their instruments, it came down to a masterful unbeaten 101 from Babar Azam who, along with a 76-ball 68 from Haris Sohail, chased down the target of 238 with five balls to spare.Jimmy Neesham’s unbeaten 97 had earlier helped New Zealand to post 237 for six – a total that was not undefendable given a slow, capricious surface that had resulted from Birmingham’s recent spell of wet weather.But Babar transcended these conditions, overcoming the pace of Lockie Ferguson, the swing of Trent Boult and some considerable turn for Mitchell Santner’s left-armers with a frictionless innings of 127 balls and 11 fours via some delightful cover drives.With Haris, who took the aerial route a couple of times before being run out in the final throes, a stand of 126 was compiled that ultimately broke the back of the chase before Sarfaraz crashed the winning runs through point.“I think this is my best innings because it was a must-win game,” said Babar, who brought up his ninth ODI century and passed 3,000 runs en route – the second fastest batsmen there, in 68 innings, after Hashim Amla (57).When Neesham pulled the final ball of the first innings into the Hollies Stand for six, it had actually capped a decent fightback from New Zealand, who were 83 for five in the 27th over after winning the toss. Neesham’s highest ODI score, allied with a 71-ball 64 from Colin de Grandhomme in stand of 132, also overcame a huge numerical disadvantage by way of support Edgbaston had been rocking from the moment Mohammad Amir’s first ball cannoned into Martin Guptill’s stumps .Another left-armer produced the standout spell, though, as Shaheen Shah Afridi tore through the New Zealand top order. From his 6ft 6in frame, this slick 19-year-old located the ideal length to tease nicks behind from Colin Munro (12), Ross Taylor (3) and Tom Latham (1) in a seven-over burst that cost a mere 11 runs.Among these strikes came an athletic one‑handed catch from Sarfaraz behind the stumps to remove Taylor. While one in the eye for the ‘supporter’ who was filmed calling Sarfaraz a ‘fat pig’ during a recent shopping trip with his family, the captain’s most significant pouch came mid-innings when Kane Williamson edged a flighted leg-break from Shadab Khan behind on 41.Boult struck early in the chase – Fakhar Zaman caught attempting a typically ambitious swipe – before Ferguson, the rubbery right-armer who has a claim to being the World Cup’s fastest bowler, bounced out Imam-ul-Haq thanks to a superb ing catch by Guptill at point.But while Ferguson repeatedly beat the outside edge in his initial spell, in Babar Pakistan had a batsman up to the task. A stand of 66 with Mohammad Hafeez was ended when the man they call The Professor holed out to Williamson’s part-time offies. But, if anything, this breakthrough –Santner getting the ball to rag at the other end – underlined New Zealand’s error in not selecting a second spinner.Their captain, Williamson, said: “We were outplayed on a tough surface by a great Pakistan side. We were right in it after taking early wickets but the partnership between Babar and Haris was fantastic.”With 11 points to their name, Williamson’s men know a win or a washout against either Australia or England will be enough to make the final four. And Pakistan? When they are in this mood, you wouldn’t bet against them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3a3c915e54e7160919bdfa4603896915416cd0/0_264_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf13cd77a3642a0191c09297c40fad97","title":"new zealand v pakistan cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Babar Azam’s hundred helped Pakistan inflict a first defeat on the Black Caps, boosting their semi-final hopes and turning up the heat on EnglandThat’s it from me. Thanks for your wonderful company throughout the day. We’ll be back at Old Trafford tomorrow for India and the West Indies, which is a lot more interesting now than it looked about a week ago. Talk to you then. G’night! Sarfaraz Ahmed speaks. Worked hard on our fielding, which was important. Definitely it was a great team effort today. The way Babar and Haris played is some of the finest batting that I have ever seen. We knew 240 wasn’t an easy target so our message to the batsmen was to bat for 50 overs. The way Babar played was one of the best innings that I have ever seen. It is not easy to handle that pressure. We are not thinking about the 1992 World Cup, we just want to do well as a team. We are very confident. Kane Williamson speaks. We have seen in our last three games so far the surfaces have given a bit to the bowlers. On a tough surface, beaten by a very impressive Pakistan side. There was more bounce than what we experienced the other day. Pakistan put the ball in the right area. But the fight we showed was outstanding to get a competitive total. With early wickets we were right in it too but with Babar and Haris they played beautifully. We thought 230-250 would be competitive and it was with a lot of threats out there but Pakistan soaked up the pressure beautifully. There are so many games in round robin you aren’t expecting to win them all but there were some glimpses of some good stuff today so we need to look forward to our next match.The mechanics. Pakistan are now on seven points and New Zealand 11. A lot needs to go wrong for the Black Caps, who play Australia and England in their final two games. As for Pakistan, they have Afghanistan next, their group stage finishing at Lord’s against Bangladesh on week-Friday. That really could be massive if England don’t find a way to bounce back against England on Saturday. Babar Azam is player of the match! Through a translator, he says that he just wanted to bat through 50 overs to win the match. He added in their meeting that they had a plan to bat carefully against the spinners when they were turning it big. In closing, he says that the crowd gives them great support when they are in England.That’s a fantastic win. The scorecard probably won’t show it, but Pakistan were under real pressure when Santner and Williamson were in operation, both Babar and Sohail beaten routinely on both edges. But they got through it, transferred the pressure back onto the bowlers, and did it easy in the end. They’re back! Sarfaraz hits the winning runs, crushing a full toss to the point rope. 49th over: Pakistan 237-4 (Babar 101, Sarfaraz 1) Target 238 We’re going to the last over. The skipper is off the mark first ball but Babar can’t pick a gap to finish it. Scores level.Well, that was unnecessary. With two to win, Sohail raced down or a quick single but Guptill made an excellent e with ball in hand at the strikers’ end to pull off a run out. Still, a fine innings from the left-hander. Outstanding, even.48th over: Pakistan 234-3 (Babar 100, Sohail 67) Target 238 What a shot! Sohail makes enough room to again find the boundary behind point. He plays that shot as well as anyone going around. Superb cricket. He then does what the crowd asks by taking a one down the ground, getting Babar back on strike. He has four balls to play with in this Ferguson over but he only needs one, carving out to deep point for the century! 124 balls to get there. “It’s his best yet!” says Wasim Akram on TV. “He’s shown his true class. He’s a special player. This was not an easy wicket to bat on but he made it look so easy. Hear the noise!” All of that. What an innings, what a response. He kisses the Edgbaston turf. He’s the first Pakistan middle order batsman to score a ton at the World Cup in 32 years, the TV adds. Sohail adds two more with a one-handed slap through cover, but in complete control. 47th over: Pakistan 225-3 (Babar 99, Sohail 60) Target 238 The Edgbaston crowd are suitably frenzied with Babar on 99, Boult the man with the ball in his hand. He beats him with a lovely little crossed-seamer, too. Next, he’s up for leg before. Not out. One ball to go in the over, they’re chanting his name... and he picks out short cover. They, and we, will have to wait. Pakistan need 13 from 18 balls.46th over: Pakistan 224-3 (Babar 99, Sohail 59) Target 238 Hard not to love the fact that, as the TV just showed, every result Pakistan had in the 1992 World Cup has been replicated so far in this competition - even down to the point that their seventh game was won by seven wickets. Ferguson was electrifying to begin at the conclusion of the first power play but has not quite hit those heights since. He is still rapid, Sohail forced to play a lookaway pull off his face, but he’s now bowling at batsmen who are so well set. Babar finishes pulling away a short all that doesn’t get up, slamming it into the gap for another four, moving to one short of a ton. “For all the deserved Kiwi playlist love-in, it’s looking increasingly likely that this Pakistani Classic of the 80’s will be rehashed,” says Nick Toovey. “It’s Zaheer Abbas, It’s Javed Miandad, It’s Shakhoor Rana. It’s Dil Dil Pakistan indeed.”45th over: Pakistan 215-3 (Babar 93, Sohail 57) Target 238 Back to back half-centuries for Sohail after coming back into the team, his three fours and two sixes leaving a matchwinning mark on both games. He’s to the milestone with a steer behind point off Boult, the 100 stand raised from the next ball with two behind square. To finish, he goes up and over extra cover for four more! Shot! 44th over: Pakistan 207-3 (Babar 93, Sohail 49) Target 238 Santner’s final over. He’s still generating plenty of bite, but with soft hands and no men around the bat, Babar gets through the balls that need defending before clobbering a couple wide of the sweeper at midwicket. Somehow, the Blackcaps’ sole spinner leaves the afternoon without a wicket, his figures 038. That’s a big win for Pakistan on a track that was genuinely turning square earlier on when Pakistan were building. 43rd over: Pakistan 204-3 (Babar 91, Sohail 48) Target 238 Babar is into the 90s with a lovely cover drive, stopped by a e on the rope. The noise at Edgbaston is as good as it gets, every run celebrated like a ton. Boult beats Babar with the final delivery well outside the off stump, but just inside the tram tracks.42nd over: Pakistan 201-3 (Babar 89, Sohail 47) Target 238 Bang, bang! Santner was just about unplayable earlier but the world has changed dramatically in the time he has been out of the attack, Babar now well on the march to a century. It shows with the first two balls of the new over, both creamed to the midwicket rope in a standing-sweep posture of sorts. Fantastic batting, all along the ground. Up comes the 200 later in the over, Babar picking out the sweeper at cover. They’re doing it easy now, the sting vanishing from the contest more by the ball. 12 off it.41st over: Pakistan 189-3 (Babar 79, Sohail 45) Target 238 Sohail is playing another matchwinning hand here, steering Boult expertly to third man for four, just as he did the South African attack time and again on Sunday. Santner has to break this partnership up in the next over or this game is surely over. “Thanks for the top WC coverage.” Thanks for being part of it, Paul McAdam. “On the Kiwi playlist theme, the late Darcy Clay deserves a mention. Left behind just half a dozen songs, but this noisy pop belter was one of them.” Noisy pop belter? Yes, please. I’m making quite the playlist for later tonight.40th over: Pakistan 183-3 (Babar 78, Sohail 40) Target 238 You don’t see Guptill misfield very often, but that’s what he has done at short cover off Babar. It hurts Santner’s belated return, which doesn’t have the same bite as the earlier spell. Pakistan need 55 from the final ten. I can’t see where the twist is coming from.39th over: Pakistan 179-3 (Babar 75, Sohail 39) Target 238 Pakistan are pulling away now. Williamson does give himself another over but it doesn’t go to plan, three singles taken with enough concern, giving Sohail the confidence to get down to a fuller ball, stroking it perfectly past the man at short cover for four more! How is it possible that Sohail wasn’t in the team that played India last Sunday? 38th over: Pakistan 172-3 (Babar 73, Sohail 34) Target 238 Trent Boult is brought back from Williamson after the Munro Experiment is scrapped after one over. But Sohail is set now so it doesn’t matter an awful lot, the No5 playing a wonderful lofted straight drive for SIX! He kicks up his back foot as contact as made, confirming that he will get the full style points from all the judges. Get Santner ON NOW. “Afternoon Adam.” Welcome, Simon McMahon. “Following on from Matt Dony’s offering, may I suggest that there will be a lot of OBOers ‘not crying’ if England do indeed crash out at the group stage. As is looking increasingly likely if Pakistan win here.” Pakistan are doing Sri Lanka and Bangladesh a big favour. Not so much England.37th over: Pakistan 164-3 (Babar 72, Sohail 27) Target 238 Williamson has given himself one too many here. They had his measure during the last two, so there was little doubt about them having a pop this time around. Ten runs was their reward, Babar jumping down to smash him once bounce over the rope at long off then thumping a long hop to the square leg boundary in consecutive balls. Pakistan need 74 in 78 balls. In reality, New Zealand need seven wickets.36th over: Pakistan 154-3 (Babar 63, Sohail 26) Target 238 Colin Munro? Wouldn’t have thought so. Floating up a nothing ball, Babar gets on the front foot and slams it into the gap at cover to the rope. This really is Pakistan’s to lose from here. “Really enjoying your Final Word pods which I only discovered fairly recently,” says George Young. Thanks for being part of it. “As Hafeez lined up that hoick off Williamson, McCullum on TV comms was just finishing saying how he’d previously been dismissed in the tournament by Finch \u0026amp Markram. Rameez Raja could barely contain his disgust. Great moment in a gripping game.”Really pleased that our game, the 50-over variety at least, still has room for the part-time tweaker at a World Cup. Next: bring back the accurate dibbly dobbler. Munro isn’t one of those, by the way, in case you were sensing a contradiction. 35th over: Pakistan 145-3 (Babar 57, Sohail 24) Target 238 The concern Williamson was providing earlier has just about vanished. He has to bring Santner back. “Admittedly I don’t know much about Kiwi music, but wasn’t there an outfit called Crowded House?” emails John Starbuck. “Too far back to be hip any more?”A challenge. A few years ago I found a youtube clip that was a (UK) Neighbours promo that used Crowded House - Into Temptation as the music when Dr Karl was doing the wrong thing by Susan in about 1997. I’ve never been able to re-find it...34th over: Pakistan 142-3 (Babar 56, Sohail 22) Target 238 “There will reach a point when Williamson feels like he has to make something happen,” says Nas on telly, “and he will have to go back to Santner. He’s got 18 deliveries of gold up his sleeve.” It’s Ferguson for now, who keeps slamming down his short stuff, but these two are both well enough set that they avoid any potholes. He hurries up Babar to begin and strikes his leading edge but the ball goes straight to ground at cover.“Surely New Zealand pop music begins and ends with the perfect Hurt Feelings by Flight Of The Conchords,” insists Matthew Dony. “Also a useful anthem for those of us disappointed in the direction of England’s World Cup.” Great shout. 33rd over: Pakistan 139-3 (Babar 55, Sohail 20) Target 238 Williamson now into his fifth, but we have passed the stage where he is beating the bat. For now, at least. Three risk-free singles constitutes a very good result for the chasing side. “Enjoying your fine wordsmithery today,” emails Jimmy Mayer. Why, thank you. “This is a lovely upbeat tune by an upcoming Kiwi band that captures my current feelings as a hope-killed England fan. We were all happy unhappy before everyone ruined our world cup by saying we would win. Go Beths yourself everyone. The Kiwi twang on “remembering puns and to take out the buns” is also a delight.”Sounds like this is going to be ight in my sweet spot. Enjoy it during drinks. 32nd over: Pakistan 136-3 (Babar 54, Sohail 18) Target 238 Ferguson’s raw pace is back as they start to mix it up, Santner held back for three a touch later. Aside from a legside wide, he’s asking a question every ball of Babar in particular, flinging it down at the better part of 90mph. But he’s seeing them well onto the bat, no doubt far happier facing this than spin at this stage of the chase. 31st over: Pakistan 132-3 (Babar 52, Sohail 17) Target 238 Williamson persists with at Sohail, who is good enough to get himself off strike without any risk. Back on strike later in the over, he’s beaten by another that has turned square before playing out the rest with soft hands. He’s nearly out the other end of this. “Evening Collo.” Nick Toovey is here. “Seems as if EnZed have missed a trick by not picking Ish Sodhi today. Santner, not a renowned turned of the ball, is ripping them like Murali out there. I wonder if they’re old pal Jeetan Patel, with his expert knowledge of Edgbaston, was consulted?” The question I have is how Ish Sodhi is ever out of this team?“Love the Kiwi hit parade but can’t help feeling sorry for Flight of the Conchords being left off the playlist,” submits Jonathan McKinley. “A bit of “Boom” might work at the fall of the next wicket (hopefully today)?” If there weren’t two spinners operating, this would be fixed. 30th over: Pakistan 128-3 (Babar 51, Sohail 15) Target 238 That question again: do New Zealand just bowler Santner out, as their best bet? He’s into his seventh here and working over Babar this time around, who is happy to get off strike. Sohail goes the other way, taking him on over midwicket for a BIG SIX! Not the worst strategy with the ball spinning so much, using his feet to get to the pitch. This is a brilliant contest. This game will probably be won in the next handful of overs.29th over: Pakistan 120-3 (Babar 50, Sohail 8) Target 238 Sohail is in all sorts of strife to Williamson now as well, twice beaten on the outside edge from consecutive balls! The skipper is giving it just as much of a rip as the specialist twirler. Earlier, he cut a four but it was the only ball he came close to middling. “It’s like a day five pitch at the moment,” says Nasser Nussain on television. 28th over: Pakistan 116-3 (Babar 50, Sohail 4) Target 238 Another brilliant, probing over from Santner. How hasn’t he picked up a wicket? He spins hard across Sohail’s blade to begin, beating the inside edge, bouncing another into the pad near enough to the glove to prompt an appeal for a catch close to the wicket. Another ragged delivery then angles back just kept out. He has 011 from six. 27th over: Pakistan 115-3 (Babar 50, Sohail 3) Target 238 The task isn’t quite as tough against Williamson, the sweepers picked out for the first half of the new over, Babar bringing up his half-century with one around the corner. The Kiwi captain, though, does find the inside edge to finish. He has to keep going, I think.“Never mind the upturned collar or wearing a jumper in the field,” writes Dan Taylor. “I spent an unnecessary part of the 80’s wearing a bandana as a headband because I’d seen Martin Crowe do it.” There’s a good reason to bat in a bandana. Dan Norcross, from TMS, explains the science behind it in the final stanza of this.26th over: Pakistan 112-3 (Babar 49, Sohail 1) Target 238 Santner gives Babar a long hop and it’s nearly a second wicket in two overs caught at deep midwicket! Thankfully for the Pakistan No3, his hoick doesn’t end up going to hand. Sohail’s turn, and he’s beaten on the inside edge. Quality bowling again from the tweaker.“Harmonic Generator by The Datsuns is a total classic,” contributes Louise Wright. Ah, The Datsuns, they sure had their moment. “I also saw a young NZ garage band a year ago that redefined the term full-on, but I can’t remember their name other than it started with “The” which doesn’t narrow it down much. I believe this is a reflection of me having given my all to their musical stylings, so clearly they’re great, but I can see that it’s not much help to you.”Time for another from me, I think. Cut Off Your Hands’ first album was an utter gem. I could pick any song from it. But this is both the happiest and saddest.25th over: Pakistan 110-3 (Babar 48, Sohail 0) Target 238 The decision to bowl himself made sense: he has 35 ODI wickets, TMS tells me, his last ODI scalps also against taken against Pakistan in January last year. The new man Sohail pats a full toss away to begin. If he bats even half as well as he did on Sunday, they’re home.“I think we are buggered to be honest but this Phoenix Foundation jam helps dull the pain,” observes Kiwi Adam Groucott. “Big Cricket fans they are too, I believe Sam penned some cricket pieces for big paper. Lou Vincent’s cameo sadly dates the video, poor Lou.” He finishes by saying nice things about the OBO. Thank you.The captain does it! He’s brought himself on to break the partnership and that’s exactly what he’s done! After going for the reverse sweep the ball before, Hafeez went hard over midwicket from the next, popping the catch down Ferguson’s throat on the boundary. Just when the Blackcaps were in strike, the captain with the golden touch has dragged them straight back into the contest.24th over: Pakistan 105-2 (Babar 46, Hafeez 29) Target 238 Santner has a second slip in place. How do they manage his overs? Does he bowl them out? He’s the most important man on the park right now. As the sole spinner, all eyes are on him. But it isn’t to bee this time around, Pakistan through it unscathed. It doesn’t mater that only one run was added. This is all about keeping Santner quiet.“Please reassure the whippersnapper Mac Millings that some of us turned up our collars in homage to (I wouldn’t dare say imitation of) Sir Garfield,” emails Geoff Wignall. “Sweaters were usually just a question of how many - essentially determined by wind direction (it was the Lancs coast).”23rd over: Pakistan 104-2 (Babar 45, Hafeez 29) Target 238 Neesham has an important job to do here, keeping the pressure on to maximise Santner’s potency. Again he’s good early before spraying a wide then giving Babar a short ball, which he tucks into through midwicket for four. “That was a free hit,” says Graeme Swann on TMS. “Neesham doesn’t have the pace for that on this wicket.” A single to cover raises the 100 for Pakistan and the roar around Edgbaston is everything you want a World Cup to be. To think where this side were a week ago. Last ball, Hafeez edges through third man for another four! That’s a big over: 13 off it! 22nd over: Pakistan 91-2 (Babar 38, Hafeez 24) Target 238 Santner is giving the ball a real chance to turn and doing everything but take a wicket. He wins an edge from Babar that runs away for two before beating the bat with an unplayable. Too good. Another edge next up, the quicker one clipped high on the bat and smacking the ‘keeper Latham in the chest. Yep, that’s a drop the replay confirms. What they would give to be able to throw the ball to Ish Sodhi right now up the other end. 21st over: Pakistan 89-2 (Babar 36, Hafeez 24) Target 238 Neesham again gets through a tidy enough over, three singles taken to the sweepers on the legside, the all-rounder attacking the stumps throughout.“If you are looking for the seminal kiwi classic for the groundsman to play,” begins Brent Lindsay, “then look no further than dalvanius and the Patea Maori club 1982 classic “poi e”. One of the great video clips too.” Okay, in it goes. 20th over: Pakistan 86-2 (Babar 34, Hafeez 23) Target 238 Mix-up! Babar was running back to the danger end first ball of Santner’s new over, scrambling back after pushing behind point. Five dots to finish, Hafeez pushed back in his crease by Santner, who is getting plenty over overspin. Graeme Swann is asked on TMS if New Zealand missed a trick not playing a second spinner. “Absolutely.” “Only one option on the NZ pop front,” insists Peter Salmon. “Perhaps the most perfect pop song of all time.” This is a big build up. “Not even going to try and work in a cricket reference. Listen, just listen!” I can’t right this moment, but I will pop it in on the basis that I’m enjoying evident passion for the track. 19th over: Pakistan 84-2 (Babar 34, Hafeez 21) Target 238 Neesham is on in an effort to replicate his earlier success, having performed so well at the death against Carlos Brathwaite on Saturday, it is worth remembering. He does well here with five dots until the final ball, which gives Babar just enough time to get onto the balls of his feet again, punching once more through point. Such a classy shot.It’s The Spin in podcast form! Geoff Lemon and Felicity Ward are the all-Aussie panel joining Emma, and they discuss yesterday’s game critiquing England’s top order, England’s bowling and the cricketarist (I am told). 18th over: Pakistan 80-2 (Babar 31, Hafeez 20) Target 238 It is the left-arm spin of Santner for the first time today and he’s immediately on the money, beating Babar with a one that dips before turning. After exchanging singles, Babar is squared up from the final ball, the edge spilling away behind point. “If the pitch is going to grip like that,” says Rameez Raja on TMS “you’ve got to be so mentally tough.” 17th over: Pakistan 77-2 (Babar 28, Hafeez 20) Target 238 Babar is high on the balls of feet playing one of the shots of the day first ball after drinks, timing Ferguson to the point boundary. Surely Pakistan’s best player will go on with it today. Hafeez is less convincing, beaten first then edging, Ross Taylor doing brilliantly to stop four runs with his right hand but only six inches away from a superb snaffle at first slip. Hafeez has nipped off the ground to the toilet during the break as he did in the fixture at Lord’s the other day. Let’s do some emails while we wait.“Lockie’s sensational pace and all is fine, but that Ferguson ‘stache is to die for!” says OB Jato. Too right. I’ve started my own recently, but not a patch on Lockie’s.“Loving your work.” Thank you, George Brown. “On the subject of Kiwi music, I trust that you’re familiar with the mighty Fat Freddy’s Drop, known for their epic, 20 minute live versions of their tracks? I feel that the slow build and delayed gratification would appeal to cricket fans... Plus the harmonica player’s outfit is white enough to play Test cricket in.” You better believe I am. 16th over: Pakistan 71-2 (Babar 23, Hafeez 20) Target 238 Nice from Babar, using what pace de Grandhomme has to tickle a couple to third man, then giving the strike to Hafeez. He’s playing the all-rounder carefully until he’s gifted a long hop to finish, punishing it behind point. That’s drinks. We’re right in the balance.15th over: Pakistan 64-2 (Babar 20, Hafeez 16) Target 238 Hafeez won’t give this up to Ferguson, don’t worry about that. Short early in the over, he’s cutting through point for four, then pulling the next short ball for the same result! Ferguson sticks with the plan, this time slipping his bumper into the grille! This is proper cricket.14th over: Pakistan 56-2 (Babar 20, Hafeez 8) Target 238 de Grandhomme has Latham up to the stumps to start his middle-overs spell after such an important contribution earlier with the bat. They’re easier runs at this end, Babar twice picking up two to finish, splitting the sweepers on both sides of the wicket.“I guess this had to be the clash of two best mustaches in the WC: Ferguson vs Hafeez,” writes Kali Srikanth. “A big ahoy from DC!! How on middle earth do NZ produce fast bowlers with such clean bowling action with accuracy and maglev level pace. From Hadlee to Cairns (in his prime) to Bond to Southee to Boult to Martin...and on.” To Ferguson. His action is a delight. Full commitment. 13th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Babar 16, Hafeez 7) Target 238 Okay, we’re back after toughly ten minutes we aren’t getting back. Instead of going upstairs to begin, Ferguson attacks the stumps of Hafeez. Knowing the shorter one must be coming up next, the veteran gets back early to pull confident for four! The quick delivers a perfect response of his own, beating the edge with an outswiger. Top contest. “I have no doubt, Adam, that you are far too young, despite OB Jato’s suggestion, to be taken as far back as 1992 by anything,” asserts Mac Millings (incorrectly). “On the other hand, the dream I had last night about Bob Willis’s 8-fer at Headingley in ‘81 dates me pretty well, as does the fact that, when I was a kid, I used to wear my collar up because that’s what the South African Cantona, Tony Grieg, did.”I still wear a cricket jumper whenever I’m in the field because that’s what Mark Waugh did. A habit I’ll never need to break now that I live in England.The delay is, of course, because of the sight screen. They are running out some black extra covers for a corner that is now white. Ladies and gents, the World Cup.Back to my happier topic: which Kiwi songs should the Cricket Ground DJ belt out when the Blackcaps have something to celebrate? There are few things better in sport than an Eden Park crowd giving this a BIG blast during rugbycricket.“Babar needs to play within himself today,” Abhijato Sensarma. “People tend to criticise him for his slow strike rate, but this chase is custom-built for him to anchor with a classical knock out of an ODI in the 90s. If he does win it for his team, the tournament table is going to open up furthermore, and the fourth playoff spot’s occupation will become as unpredictable as this Pakistan team.”11th over: Pakistan 45-2 (Babar 16, Hafeez 1) Target 238 Ooooooohhhhhh! Hafeez nearly runs himself out first ball! What is he doing? Ferguson has him feeling off the front foot in defence, the 38-year-old taking about four steps down the track for reasons best explained by him. Had the throw been on target, he would have been gone first ball. Next up, the bouncer! Accurate and anging back, he keeps it off his helmet with his glove. That’s class fast bowling. Watching back the Imam dismissal, that’s shorter than I’ve given it credit for below as well. Rapid. He keeps going, cutting Hafeez in half with another banged in there, finding his inside edge with the final delivery of the brilliant set. What an outstanding over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7ceb011f9b92bf53fb95080e49b459fac46746/0_174_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7fb44d44eb1696458f36f83b5f1cd3c","title":"20 best food tours around world lisbon lima havana hanoi","story":"Feast your eyes on these foodie walking tours, which reveal the flavours – and culture – of cities from Lisbon to Lima, Havana to HanoiTaste Porto’s tours are rooted in fundamental beliefs about the gastronomic scene in Portugal’s second city. First, Portuenses like to keep things simple: so, no fusion experiments. Second, it’s as much about the people behind the food, as the food itself. “Food is an expression of culture,” says US-born Carly Petracco, who founded Taste Porto in 2013 with her Porto-born husband Miguel and his childhood buddy André. “We like to show who’s doing the cooking, who’s serving the food, who’s supplying the ingredients, and so on.”She’s good to her word. Walking the city with one of the six guides feels less like venue-hopping and more like dropping in for a catch-up with a series of food-loving, old friends. Everywhere you go (whether it’s the Loja dos Pastéis de Chaves cafe with its flaky pastries or the Flor de Congregados sandwich bar with its sublime slow-roasted pork special) the experience is as convivial as it is culinary. And it’s not just food either.

So says 93-year-old Carlos Pina, whose father founded coffee roastery Negrita in 1924 and who still works there. One of only two roasteries left in Lisbon, Negrita is in a former stables in the Graça neighbourhood and has survived because the family own the building: elsewhere across the city rising rents are forcing decades-old businesses to close.Graça and neighbouring Mouraria are still home to families who shop in local stores, making the two neighbourhoods ideal for Culinary Backstreets: its food tours aim to give visitors an insight into the city’s history and culture. After breathing in the scent of coffee and roasted spices at Negrita, the tour takes in a traditional cerveceria for plates of clams, velvet crab and prego (steak sandwich). Then there’s a shot of cherry liqueur at a local corner store and a takeaway grilled chicken eaten in the no-nonsense bar of a neighbourhood association – another fast-disappearing feature of old Lisbon.A contrast to these insights into old Lisbon is tiny A Taberna do Mar, which opened in 2018 opposite the church and convent of Graça. Here chef-owner Filipe Rodrigues combines his love of Japanese techniques, Portuguese produce and a passion for sustainability to create inventive dishes. Try samples of horse mackerel bone broth and smoked sashimi of yellow fin tuna. Even the pudding, based on traditional egg custard, has a hint of sardine.

Yet, Culinary Backstreets’ tour – one of the newest among the company’s global offerings – illustrates just how much there is to discover in this hypnotic city. The tour begins outside the old city walls in Porta Capuana with a mid-morning espresso, rum baba and sweet, ricotta-filled sfogliatelle. Next up is a third-generation baccaleria for samples of salt cod, a “healing” glass of sulphuric water from Vesuvius, and a bruschetta-like snack in the city’s last traditional friselle bakery. The 10 stops on the five-hour tour offer much more than quick bites and photo-ops. The guides have fostered relationships with the bakers, vendors, and cooks who make this food scene unique, and this allows rare peeks into bakers’ ovens and chats with artisans. A stroll among the buzzing stalls of a local market highlights a slice of Naples in an area many visitors are unlikely to see. The tour also hits the “must-sees” – perfect for those on a tight schedule who don’t want to miss tasting a Sorbillo pizza or a shot of limoncello.• €107pp, tour 5 hours, culinarybackstreetsWill VibertThe Duchess of Palma – Nicoletta Lanza Tomasi – has a crash course in Sicilian cuisine and it begins with a tour of Palermo’s Mercado del Capo. “I didn’t realise I knew so much about the city’s history until I started teaching my cooking class to fund the upkeep of the palace,” she says, working between her favourite spice merchant, fishmonger, shouty fruit and veg traders and stalls stacked with bags of pasta.Part food tour, part cooking masterclass, Cooking with the Duchess delves deep into the way Palermitans have eaten for centuries, from the Arab traders that first set up Mercado del Capo 1,000 years ago to the Jewish, Normans and Greeks that made this city the street-food capital of Europe. It also ends at Nicoletta’s home, the cacti-lined 18th-century Palazzo Lanza Tomasi – a palace on the city’s seafront, where the Duke’s father, author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, once sat to write the iconic novel, Il Gattopardo (The Leopard).“I have always cooked traditional, Sicilian dishes to preserve the heritage of the island,” says Nicoletta. The four-course menu changes seasonally but street-food inspired chickpea panelle, swordfish rolls and almond and pistachio pesto ruvidelli are examples of the recipes you can get hands on with in the palace kitchen, between herb foraging on the jasmine-laced terrazza and glasses of Sicilian wine. Then on to a tour of the palace and lunch with the Duke and Duchess in the grand banqueting hall.• €146, butera28.itAnastasia MiariUntour’s street eats breakfast tour starts with a tasting of three of Shanghai’s four most popular breakfast foods, collectively known as the “four heavenly kings”. There are crispy, oily, fried youtiao doughnuts, which are dipped into a freshly made sweetened soy milk that also helps wash down a dense cifantuan rice ball. This stodgy-and-satisfying Shanghainese dish combines white and red sticky rice, stuffed with salted duck egg and tart mustard pickles. These are enjoyed at Xiangcai Renjia, a Hunan-style restaurant that, in the morning, doubles as a breakfast joint, making use of the free seating to serve food made by the owners of the food stall next door.Next, the tour moves to the Xiangyang Road area of the Former French Concession, where visitors can sample pancakes, steamed buns and dumplings, all served from tiny holes in the wall. The classic jianbing, or Chinese crepe, is a fitting substitute for the sesame pancake that is traditionally the fourth “heavenly” breakfast item. Jianbing, which is best enjoyed straight off the griddle folded around egg, fried wonton skin, pickles and spicy sauce, can be traced back 2,000 years to north-east China but is now popular across the country as an on-the-go breakfast.Elsewhere, in a tiny sit-down place next door to the jianbing stall, there are rich and flavoursome pork-filled soup dumplings, served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Of course, breakfast in a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai isn’t all about tradition: trendy coffee shops also serve western-style choices with Chinese characteristics.

Of particular note are her tours of Greenpoint, a historically Polish neighbourhood on the northern Brooklyn waterfront, in which participants swing by Acme Smoked Fish Factory, which is only open to the public one day a week, and Pyza, a traditional restaurant serving cheese blintzes worthy of a Polish grandmother.• $54pp, tours from 3 hours, noshwalksDHThis city of eternal spring almost never sees a day without sun, so what better way to take a taco tour than by bicycle. El Taco Club leads small groups (up to 10) through the parks, art-deco buildings and colourful markets of the city’s chic Roma, Condesa and Polanco neighbourhoods to find delicious tacos at hole-in- the-wall taquerias and street stands.The tour, which varies according to season and day of the week, might include a restaurant where patrons are serenaded by strolling musicians, offering a speciality of central Mexico, barbacoa, which is tender mutton wrapped in agave leaves and roasted in its own juices in an outdoor pit. Or a market stall serving cochinita pibil: slow-cooked suckling pig from the Yucatan marinated in a crimson chilli and achiote paste. A small street stand prepares brisket, tender enough to make any grandmother proud. And simple tacos done with tortillas made of fast disappearing heirloom varieties of corn and organic, locally grown avocados can be sampled at star chef Enrique Olvera’s Molino el Pujol. A visit to a traditional cantina is included to top the journey with a beer or mezcal.• £48pp, includes folding bikes, helmets, food and beverages, tour 3 hours, eltaco.clubNicholas GilmanTaste for sugar in Cuba – a nation once rich from selling the sweet stuff – is embedded in the locals’ DNA. From ice-cream to milkshakes, churros and coconut delicacies to coffee sunk with teaspoons of crystals, and cakes fashioned in neon meringue, embrace the island’s candy choices. Irish-born Cubaphile Tanja Buwalda moved to Havana 10 years ago after running a restaurant in Cork. Starting a food blog to recount her travels and Cuban food experiences, she now runs food tours explaining how and where food comes from in Cuba, dual-currency hacks, how private front-room restaurants (paladares) source ingredients, and Cuba’s organic food revolution.With Tanja, you’ll learn as much about Cuba’s contemporary food issues as you will about what the locals snack on. Try coffee from Habaneros’ windows – an espresso will cost 3p and will probably be dredged in sugar for Cuban tastes – slurp intense guarapo (sugarcane juice), and hunt for the best cookies, and creamy mamey milkshakes, across the city. While cruising around, admire the wedding-cake architecture built during the 20th-century sugar boom and sate savoury cravings as Tanja introduces you to her favourite hamburger joint.• £103 for 2-8 people, excluding transport and snacks, contact Tanja.Buwalda at gmailCBIf you are looking for a way to make an already exciting food scene even more edgy try the Ruta del Callao gastro tour. Callao is Lima’s port, and has its own flavour (musically it prefers salsa to cumbía) and though it has some of the city’s most crime-ridden neighbourhoods – it also has some of its most lip-smacking seafood. Callao is one of the best spots on Peru’s 2,414km coastline to eat ceviche, and Freddy Alarcón’s Combi Roja (red van) is one of the places to try Peru’s flagship dish. Freddy has been cooking on wheels for more than 30 years. With ready smile he can prepare a hake ceviche at lightning speed and diners can sit and eat in the specially adapted van on fake leather seats.Next stop is El Colorao de Chucuito, run by Andrés Angeles, a former merchant marine who has created 20 of his own dishes. His specialities are muchame de atún, layers of dried tuna fish served with avocado and olive oil, and swordfish in sea snail sauce. In Callao all roads lead to La Punta, a peninsula that juts out into the Pacific, lined with pastel-hued art-deco homes. At its end is Don Giuseppe’s eponymous eatery, owned by an older Genoa-born seaman who met his love on the Peruvian coast and decided to stay. His restaurant is famous for its pan con pejerrey, a crispy fried fish sandwich.

Besides pushing waistline boundaries with abundant servings of meat, this three-hour walking tour also opens the doors to unexpected Buenos Aires corners, revealing low-profile but authentic bodegones (taverns) and steakhouses in Palermo and San Telmo.The first mouthful is legendary Argentine hot sausage sandwich choripán, taken at 120-year-old La Cañita, a former store dating back to when sugar cane grew in this neighbourhood. Unusually, La Cañita’s chori is made from beef rather than pork and homemade chimichurri sauce is the standard topping. Next is pizzeria La Guitarrita (though it also serves empanadas). Here, hand-cut whole-knuckle beef pasties win out over pies, paired with fragrant Torrontés white wine.The real parrilla deal is revealed at stop three. The sign on this secret spot’s door says “cerrado” (closed) but Antonella knows better. Here, asador Albertito Odetti tends to slabs of Argentina’s prized beef, grill hood decorated with swirly fileteado letters. It’s a legit hole in the wall, with star dishes scrawled on A4 and stuck to windows there’s puffy provoleta (cheese), hand-cut chips, malbec and a token salad, which are worthy companions to 800g of medium-rare bife de chorizo and entraña (to share).

It imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran that have plunged the country’s currency into a nosee and created mass unemployment.The credit line is expected to be announced as early as Thursday – the same day Iran will break part of the nuclear deal by surpassing the 300kg limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile. Iran will argue that its long-signalled moves to breach the limit do not breach the JCPOA, claiming it is entitled to take reversible steps to suspend parts of the deal if another signatory to the deal has failed to keep a commitment, notably the undertaking to boost trade between the EU and Iran.The EU is likely to counter that Europe is using its best endeavours to boost trade, but has no obligation under the deal to take steps to compensate for the effect of threatened US sanctions on any firm that trades with Iran. The US sanctions regime – including the removal of all Iranian oil export waivers – has been much more draconian than Europe or Iran foresaw.The EU will argue that the credit line should be seen by Tehran as a signal of intent to launch a trading mechanism focused initially on humanitarian goods that will allow companies to trade with minimum access to the banking system.The EU is still not in a position to announce any specific transactions under the mechanism, but officials have repeatedly said that some deals will be announced in the next few days. The EU may not give specific transactions publicity for fear that it will alert the US Treasury to impose sanctions.Iran has said that announcement of a credit line – briefed to the Iranians in lengthy technical talks in Tehran last week – hardly represents the seriousness of intent it requires to stay inside the JCPOA.The idea of a trading mechanism was first announced in January, but it has proved a huge technical and legal task of international co-ordination for Europe to construct a scheme in which even mid-level European banks are willing to participate.European officials recognise that the crisis could spiral out of control in the coming weeks, with the International Atomic Energy Agency declaring Iran is in breach of the deal in a matter of days. At the same time France, Germany and Italy are raising concerns about Iran’s ballistic missile programme, saying it is designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear payload.European leaders will use the G20 summit of world leaders in Japan starting on Friday to press the US to de-escalate the crisis, and to clarify the precise demands it is making of Tehran. Russia and China are also likely to urge the US to back off. Japan as summit host has put itself forward as a mediator.But Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, says he is not willing to negotiate while his country is under sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d691d3dec3e85e445cc1fbffffb999e396e71c2/0_585_4547_2729/master/4547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba918131c4dc29eb92e448f28e1cfffe","title":"norman barwin canada ivf doctor loses licence wrong sperm","story":"At the height of his 41-year medical career the Canadian fertility specialist Norman Barwin was known as the “baby god” but the 80-year old has been stripped of his medical licence for repeatedly using the wrong sperm – including his own – to impregnate his patients.Barwin was deemed incompetent by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which described the former doctor’s behaviour as “beyond reprehensible” and said the damage he caused will  generations.Barwin did not notify his patients of the errors, leaving them to discover years later the truth about their children’s paternity.“It is the most egregious violation of a patient’s trust. These patients came to Dr Barwin and trusted him to help them start a family,” said Carolyn Silver, the College’s senior counsel.Barwin pleaded no contest and did not attend Tuesday’s disciplinary hearing in Toronto.The disgraced former doctor also faces a class action which alleges he is the biological father of at least 11 children conceived in his clinic. He is accused of using the wrong sperm on 50 to 100 women, with the earliest complaints reaching as far back as 1978. Frances Shapiro Munn, a lawyer on the case, welcomed the medical community’s acknowledgment of the victims’ ordeal. She noted that the impact of his actions would “ripple through their lives for a long time”.The College said it started its own investigation of Barwin because of the media coverage surrounding the civil case. It has since found evidence that Barwin fathered at least seven children and wrongly inseminated 13 women.Barwin was previously suspended by the College in 2013 after admitting to inseminating four women using the wrong sperm. He resigned his medical licence in 2014 after other cases came to light. On Tuesday, the College revoked his licence completely and ordered him to pay costs totalling C$10,370 (US$8,000).In the College’s summary of its judgment, it described a dozen cases in which women were impregnated with the wrong sperm. In one case, one of the resulting children found out through an online DNA registry and then further medical DNA testing that Barwin is her biological father.Another of the adult children read a victim impact statement at the hearing. In 2015, Rebecca Dixon, then 25, underwent blood testing for celiac disease, a typically hereditary illness neither of her parents suffered. Through that testing she and her parents found out she had no genetic link to the man she believed to be her father.In her victim impact statement, Dixon said “in that moment, my life changed forever.”Dr Edward Hughes, who was retained as an expert witness by the college, suggested that Barwin’s defence – that improper cleaning of a sperm counter he tested with his own semen must have led to mistaken insemination – was “implausible”.“This is a tragic situation, in which a sea of avoidable harm was done,” wrote Hughes."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin academics find Government policy may have opposite effect to that intendedJim Ferry appeared for the 14th time before Justice Barrett over Rossbracken dumping34-year-old was fatally strangled and body was found on Bleach Road in KilkennyStudy finds only a third of women encouraged to pursue careers in StemUp to 150 other cases are potentially affected by the Court of Appeal judgmentDepartment has written to company for clarification over \u0026euro1bn broadband claimTalks to take place on Thursday in an attempt to avert three more strikes by health staffInvestigating garda\u0026iacute suspect arrested man and desceased were known to each otherDublin Pride festival to culminate on Saturday afternoon with parade through cityProhibition notices remain in place due to sewage overflow as weather warms upHarris: North Frederick St property should never have been cleared during rush hourSeamus Kane denied he broke locks or erected Irish Tricolour flags on the landsTrial of two men accused of 25-year-old\u0026rsquos murder hears evidence from dead man\u0026rsquos partnerSiptu agrees to further WRC talks in attempt to halt three further days of action next weekJoe McHugh in \u0026lsquointense discussion\u0026rsquo over improving pupil-teacher ratiosTrinity and DCU selected as part of new \u0026lsquoEuropean University\u0026rsquo initiativeCoroner says Robbie Conway\u0026rsquos heart stopped after cocktail of methadone and liquid heroinJudge says he had no option but to hand Aiden Hargreaves consecutive sentencesMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues warning for six counties in west and south of the State"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3938411.1561567868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin bathing even when you tell them the water is not safe they ll get in anyway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Lifeguards Niall Finnegan and Aisling Carroll at Dollymount Strand.

We swim here regularly but I wouldn’t be getting in the water now, not with the warnings in place.”Sweeney was more tempted to go or a swim.“I love sea swimming and go pretty often,” she said. “I might go to this weekend even if the ban is still in place but I won’t be putting my head under the water and I’ll think twice if I have a cut anywhere. I definitely won’t let my kids go in.”Boat tripHer children, Thomas and Eva, are in the sea scouts and were due to take a boat out with their troop this week. It was cancelled because of the pollution.“Dollymount is one of the joys of living in Dublin,” Carroll said. “Living by the sea is a great thing but it is being ruined by the sewage.”Green Party leader Eamon Ryan echoed their concerns and said it was a “sad reflection of the way we treat our natural environment” that 30 million litres of sewage could be pumped into Dublin Bay “stopping people enjoying the amenities because they had been polluted to an unsafe level”.He said the “contamination of our beautiful beaches and pristine water has been continuing unchecked - Dublin Bay is recognised by Unesco as an internationally important biosphere, but the Government is not protecting it”.At the end of last month Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy welcomed the publication of the latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report on bathing water quality in Ireland which noted “further improvements in the quality of Ireland’s bathing waters compared with last year”.In response to the latest bathing prohibition, a department spokesman said the overflows were caused “by exceptional levels of rainfall during a yellow rain warning in Dublin”.‘Bubbling’He said overflows were facilitated to ensure “raw sewage does not back up in the network and end up bubbling up into people’s front gardens” and pointed out that it was standard practice in wastewater treatment plants around the world. He said no plant or pumping station is designed to take extreme rainfall “and this could happen again in similar weather conditions”.A Dublin City Council spokeswoman said the results of a tests on samples taken at Dollymount on Monday were not expected back until Thursday, when temperatures are due to rise to 27 degrees, and that the “prohibition will be in place until a clear set of results is obtained”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3938507.1561575546!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"urging households to adopt renewable tech may increase energy use","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe research paper also found that the renewable technologies are more often used by wealthy householdsHouseholds using Government grants to install solar panels and other renewable technologies do not see a reduction in their energy usage, and may end up using more electricity, new research has found.A research paper by academics from the Technological University of Dublin (TU Dublin) suggests that the Government’s policy to encourage households to adopt renewable technologies may have the opposite effect to that intended.“Given our findings suggest that the presence of micro-RES does not result in a decrease in total energy use in the home, we suggest that this element of Irish energy policy around residential sector needs to be re-evaluated.”The authors suggest that adopters need to “change their ‘behaviour as usual’ approach to address the rebound effect”.Wealthier householdsThe paper also found that the technologies are more often used by wealthy households. This is contrary to the Government’s policy goals, intended to make the devices accessible through grants.Those installing the technologies “are more likely to be wealthier households, taking advantage of support schemes designed to financially incentivise households that are tentative about whether or not to adopt micro-RES”.“As these schemes are funded through consumer energy bills, this may relatively disadvantage poorer households.” The State, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, offers grant support for the installation of the so-called micro-RES technologies, which include solar panels and wind turbines. “The results would suggest that the households adopting micro-RES and availing of the support schemes are the ones that need them least.”The paper was authored by Michael Chesser, Jim Hanly and Damien Cassells from TU Dublin, in conjunction with Nikolaos Apergis from the University of Piraeus.The paper also suggests that Irish policy on the energy efficiency of new homes is having the desired effect. “The results strongly support the finding that newer built homes use less fuel than older homes, indicating that Irish policy to increase energy efficiency in the residential sector through greater efficiency standards is having its desired impact.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3938461.1561572356!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says government is taking eir  seriously","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: If the offer stacks up it is a ‘big turnaround’. Photograph: ReutersThe Department of Communications is seeking clarification from telecommunications company Eir about its chief executive’s claim that they could provide the National Broadband Plan for €1 billion. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government wanted to establish “whether this offer is real, if it stacks up” because it was a “big turnaround” for the company, which had previously withdrawn from the tender process.Mr Varadkar said that if Eir could do the plan for €1 billion “then I’m all ears and we have to listen to it”.He later told Green Party leader Eamon Ryan “we have to take what was said yesterday seriously”.The department has written to the telecommunications firm in the wake of comments by its chief executive Carolan Lennon to the Oireachtas Communications Committee on Tuesday that the company could roll out high speed broadband to 540,000 homes, farms and businesses for a third of the current €2.7 billion price tag.Rural IrelandMr Varadkar told Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin that “we need to know what kind of delay would be imposed on people in rural Ireland waiting for broadband if we went back to a new procurement process”.He said “everyone understands that neither a private nor state company can just be given a contract. There has to be a new procurement process.”Mr Martin pointed to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act from a meeting in September last year when then minister for communications Denis Naughten was in office.The Fianna Fáil leader said the documents showed a “cavalier approach” to ballooning costs, which increased €300 million in one month.Mr Martin said he welcomed “that the Government is prepared to look at this to try to deliver the same objective but in a much more cost-effective way for the taxpayer”.Mr Martin and the Green Party leader noted that Eir rejected the Taoiseach’s comments on Tuesday that the company would bypass houses and not connect them and would not cover the 25 years of maintenance costs.Mr Ryan said it would require “slightly different service level arrangements but, again, these would be the same that apply in the rest of the country. Eir is adamant that it can do it”.Last-mile connectionHe said the company had stated that the provision would include connection right to the house. “It includes the last-mile connection – the overhead wire to the home.”The Taoiseach said the comments from Eir raised a lot of questions and among the things they needed to find out is “how there can be such a big difference between the €2.7 billion bid from Eir and this offer of €1 billion now”.He and the Department of Communications were concerned that a big part of the difference between the two offers “would be met by imposing higher charges on those 500,000 homes, farms and businesses in rural areas”. He said Eir would not be making up the difference and the objective was to provide high speed broadband to rural communities “without connection charges or fees higher than those paid in urban Ireland”.Higher charges and fees to those customers would be “a serious problem for us”, Mr Varadkar added. If the difference is being borne by people in rural Ireland, we need to know that and we need to know how much they will be expected to pay under the Eir plan.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3938425.1561569089!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pride flag to fly over leinster house for first time at weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCeann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl and Senator Jerry Buttimer with Oireachtas colleagues at the Oireachtas LGBT+ group launch.

Photograph: Randall HillReutersAt no point in Romeo and Juliet does Shakespeare explain the “ancient grudge” between the Montagues and the Capulets. The great seer into the soul leaves us to infer that hatred is self-renewing. Humans do not need specifiable reasons to fight each other.Joe Biden’s English can be unShakespearean (“jobs”, he once said, is a “three-letter word”) but the former US vice-president sees something of fair Verona in Washington. To his mind, Republicans and Democrats feud more out of muscle memory than principle. He pines for the businesslike comity of yesteryear and aims to restore it if he becomes president in 2020. Barack Obama rose to national fame with a similar commitment 15 years ago. No conscientious leader could wish for anything less.But then no conscientious leader could pretend it is even remotely viable. It has become customary in the US to urge “bipartisanship” as though it were just a question of tone and goodwill. The implication is that Americans have much in common on matters of substance, only to be funnelled into rival sects by a rotten political process. It is certainly easier than admitting that some citizens are relaxed about, say, the demographic trend away from European descendants, while others feel raw pangs of dispossession about it.All democracies have their schisms but not all have recognisably “liberal” and “conservative” judges on their highest court, or the politicisation of something as dry as the census. As for star-cross’d lovers, a 2018 survey for the Atlantic found that 45 per cent of Democrats would be somewhat or very unhappy if their child married a Republican.Differences of this kind cannot be overcome by giving it the old college try. Yet that hope continues to bewitch people as smart as South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, an emollient sort who identifies “language” as what separates Americans, who otherwise share “values”.Wishful thinkingAnother version of the same naivety blames the cleaving of the US on Fox News (average primetime audience: 2.4 million) or Facebook (as if Republicans and Democrats were high-fiving each other before 2004) or the uncompetitive congressional districts thrown up by gerrymandering. The pattern here is wishful thinking. The American house is not ided against itself, according to this analysis, but the plumbing and mechanics cause needless tiffs. We need some technical maintenance, is all. How comforting and implausible.No doubt, politicians make any ideological rifts worse than they need to be with foul rhetoric and legislative intransigence. But they are not magicking them out of nothing. Theirs is the narcissism of big differences.Nor was there ever much of an Eden to restore. Biden glows with nostalgia for the mid-20th century Washington of liberal Republicans and southern Democrats, of alliances to Get Things Done. He makes less of the urban riots and war protests that were costing lives at the same time. In other words, the fraternal give-and-take of Capitol Hill was never proof of underlying national unity. It was something of a veneer, and it was going to peel off in time.The animus of recent decades is not all that exceptional. Whether the locus of ision is Washington or the street, there has been lots of it since at least the early 19th century. Even if we leave aside a civil war that killed roughly 2 per cent of the population, there was intense resistance to the New Deal. There was inter-ethnic strife at the turn of the last century. The togetherness of the republic did not first come into question circa 1994. If anything, the disunity that has metastasised since then seems benign to anyone taking a longer view.Ducking or deferringAnd even the bipartisanship that did exist in the past was often achieved by not doing things, by ducking or deferring questions as fraught as the housing and voting rights of some citizens. Who would now argue that the US was better for such prevarication? Who would put the civility of the process over the outcome? Was the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which enabled the Vietnam war, any wiser for being near-unanimous in its congressional support?Anyone who has fallen out with friends over politics in recent years, having once associated such behaviour with bores and fanatics, has learnt something. Some beliefs, it turns out, really are irreconcilable. The job of politics is to contain them, lest they spill into civil disorder. It cannot aspire to do much more. It cannot always even finesse them into constructive legislation that splits the difference. The promise of bipartisanship is always and everywhere rousing to hear. That does not make it any less of a fool’s errand. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeTory leadership hustings live: Boris Johnson says the chances of a no-deal Brexit are a \u0026#39million to one\u0026#39Comment: Bureaucracy and bean-counting are taking the joy out of being a GPIran readies to breach uranium restrictions as confrontation with United States deepensMPs warn Russia let off hook over Crimea annexation as it rejoins PACEPrince William: It would be \u0026#39absolutely fine by me\u0026#39 if George, Charlotte or Louis were LGBTCaravaggio sold to mystery buyer before auction will go on display in \u0026#39great museum\u0026#39How studying nursing can earn you a better salary than an English degree from OxbridgeOnline paedophile hunters are abusers trying to reinvent themselves as \u0026#39good people\u0026#39, says former police chiefHeatwave \u0026#39hell\u0026#39 claims first lives as temperatures soar above 40 degrees Celsius across EuropeComment: The EU will come to regret its economic blackmail of SwitzerlandMet Commissioner warns police must improve technology use to bring criminals to justice Comment: Letting Boris off his leash may be the canniest strategy of all Beloved \u0026#39Blackheath Donkey\u0026#39 stabbed in suspected \u0026#39gang initiation\u0026#39 attackSri Lanka president signs four death warrants to end decades long moratoriumDutch railway to pay \u0026#39tens of millions\u0026#39 of euros to compensate Holocaust victimsEhud Barak announces Israeli politics comeback to defeat Benjamin NetanyahuSandwich manufacturer linked to listeria outbreak is cleared to produce againComment: Jeremy Hunt\u0026#39s boxing-ring talk has gone too far.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignFertility doctor loses licence after using his own sperm to inseminate hundreds of patientsTory leadership hustings live: Boris Johnson says the chances of a no-deal Brexit are a \u0026#39million to one\u0026#39Comment: Bureaucracy and bean-counting are taking the joy out of being a GPIran readies to breach uranium restrictions as confrontation with United States deepensMPs warn Russia let off hook over Crimea annexation as it rejoins PACEPrince William: It would be \u0026#39absolutely fine by me\u0026#39 if George, Charlotte or Louis were LGBTCaravaggio sold to mystery buyer before auction will go on display in \u0026#39great museum\u0026#39How studying nursing can earn you a better salary than an English degree from OxbridgeOnline paedophile hunters are abusers trying to reinvent themselves as \u0026#39good people\u0026#39, says former police chiefHeatwave \u0026#39hell\u0026#39 claims first lives as temperatures soar above 40 degrees Celsius across EuropeComment: The EU will come to regret its economic blackmail of SwitzerlandMet Commissioner warns police must improve technology use to bring criminals to justice Comment: Letting Boris off his leash may be the canniest strategy of all Beloved \u0026#39Blackheath Donkey\u0026#39 stabbed in suspected \u0026#39gang initiation\u0026#39 attackSri Lanka president signs four death warrants to end decades long moratoriumDutch railway to pay \u0026#39tens of millions\u0026#39 of euros to compensate Holocaust victimsEhud Barak announces Israeli politics comeback to defeat Benjamin NetanyahuSandwich manufacturer linked to listeria outbreak is cleared to produce againComment: Jeremy Hunt\u0026#39s boxing-ring talk has gone too far.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) today revealed that 340,498 residents quit London to live in other parts of the UK. It marks the highest rate of people fleeing the capital since the ONS began collecting data in 2012. Experts have blamed the exodus from London on inflated house prices and violent crime rates.Over the same period, just 237,270 people migrated into the city from elsewhere in the UK, meaning that the capital lost a net 103,228 iniduals to other parts of the country.The record figure only relates to 2018 and therefore does not account for the recent slump in the market, which is widely attributed to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.  It also only tracks internal migration, and does not account for migration from sources outside the UK.Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) said that “property prices are a big deal” and the main cause of internal migration from London. “Obviously people also want a better quality of life, but they also want access to good schools, to live in rural areas and to get away from the stabbings.” For every year since 2012, the south east was consistently the most popular destination for those choosing to leave London. However their figures are increasing. In 2017, 336,010 people left London and the figure for the previous year was 291,630. This continued the rising trend from 2015 (283,0000), 2014 (273,0000), 2013 (251,00 and 2012 (255,140). In April the ONS released data revealing that knife crime had surged to the highest level since records began. Murder and manslaughter figures also reached a 10-year high in 2018 with 732 people killed.Earlier this week the former Oasis frontman, Gallagher, blamed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan for the capital’s knife-crime epidemic.The 46-year-old father of four, who lives in north London, said: “Every time you wake up in the morning, there’s some 16-year-old kid been knifed to death. I’ve got kids that age, out and about and that, doing their thing, living, being young. That freaks me right out – it does worry me. I’ve got teenagers.”Last weekend, four people were killed within four days in London, putting the capital’s knife crime in the international spotlight as US President, Donald Trump also criticised Mr Khan over his handling of the issue.London typically attracts young people drawn by university and career opportunities and it often loses residents in older age groups, particularly families with young children. However the new figures reveal a net inflow of 30,094 people aged 20 to 24, slowing to just 5,816 for the 25 to 29 age group.This has flipped to a net outflow of 19,070 for people aged 30 to 34. Rising rent and property prices have been to blame for young families looking to escape the capital. Neil Park, head of the ONS’s population estimates unit, said: “In the last two years, population growth in the UK has been at its lowest rate since 2004.“For the fifth year in a row, net international migration was a bigger driver of population change than births and deaths.“However, overall population change to the year mid-2018 has remained fairly stable, as an increase in net international migration has been roughly matched by the fewest births in over a decade and the highest number of deaths since the turn of the century.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They can stay indoors.The seller added: I will need a day to get them ready and then documents will be supplied...after that I will carry them to American Airlines and register them for a flight.When they arrive in the UK, you will be notied and after that they will be delivered to your address.You only need to make an advance payment for the process and once you receive the cubs and confirm they are in good health, you pay our balance.They come with registration papers and a DVD...you can learn more from the disc. When they get bigger they will be perfect and you will enjoy them more.In a breach of Facebook guidelines, one trader advertised tiger cubs for £,, Transvaal lion cubs for £,, African lion cubs for £, and cheetah cubs for £,.Another seller claimed he could deliver a leopard cub from Germany to the buyer’s home address in Britain for £, plus an extra £ for shipping costs.He said: “Leopard cubs are fast selling pets and loved by many people around the world.”Under UK law people who keep animals that are wild, dangerous or exotic must apply to their local council for a licence.They are granted onlythey can provide necessary safety measures at their home and after a fee is paid.None of those selling exotic animals on Facebook mentioned the need to obtain a licence from the local authority.Animal welfare officials have called on social media companies to do more to crack down on the trade.Lis Key, of International Animal Rescue, told the Sun Online: “The internet does make it easier for the traders to hide – and easier for them to reach a vast market.Traders are increasingly turning to social media sites like Facebook to sell exotic animals.In terms of what the dangers are of selling exotic animals on the internet: clearly neither the buyers or sellers can have the animals’ best interests at heart. The former are seeking trophies, the latter are out to make money.“The animals are often kept hidden away in cramped conditions and go without food or water for long periods of time. Inevitably, many die before they are even sold. Perhaps they are the lucky ones.”Richard Thomas, from TRAFFIC, the wildle trade monitoring group, told the Sun Online: “It’s so dficult to police because most of the Facebook groups are private closed.“It’s a new avenue which the criminal underworld will try to exploit.Martin Simms, Director of Investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, has dealt with cases including the attempted sale of dead bats online and the suspected sale of sperm whale teeth hacked from the mouth of a dead whale washed up on a British beach.He believes Facebook has a duty to halt any illegal wildle activity.There have also been cases where wild British hedgehogs have been passed off as exotic African Pygmy Hedgehogs by rustlers trying to sell them as pets on Facebook, as well as sites such as Gumtree.In a separate case, in April last year champion cage fighter Steve Dossett sparked outrage when he posted pictures of orphaned fox cubs on his social media page and asked for £ per animal.He posted photos of them in a box in his home and wrote “fox cubs for sale,  pounds lovely pets”.In another post under another photograph, he wrote foxes drinking milk out of a bowl, who wants one Horried animal lovers saw the ad and begged him to take the animals to a shelter instead.Eventually, a member of Dossett’s family called Surrey-based Wildle Aid Foundation and volunteers from the charity went to his flat and took seven cubs away.Facebook told the Sun Online it is investigating."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004960","title":"social mobility toff at top no10","story":"Not that Old Etonians always make good Prime Ministers.The last one was David Cameron, and lookwhat a national catastrophe he turned out to be.For anyone who cares about social mobility, the depressing news is that  Downing Street is reserved for toffs. Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

as well as the use of cannabis products in electronic cigarettes and e-liquids.Laws state consumption of the class B drug is okay as long as youre over , purchasing the cannabis from a state licensed seller and consuming it in the appropriate places - that means on private property, mostly and not in any parks, bars, restaurants or beaches. According to Dr Stanton Glantz, who is a professor of medicine at the University of Calornia San Francisco Centre for Tobacco Control and Research, e-cigarettes are associated with heart attacks, strokes and lung disease.Glantz, a supporter of the ban admitted that in his opinion, electronic cigarettes shouldnt even be on the market.Young people have almost indiscriminate access to [e-cigarettes] he said, and claims that the use of them has completely reversed the progress weve made in youth smoking in the last few years.The doctor said that due to inaction on the matter from the American Food and Drug Administration , its unfortunately falling to states and localities to step into the breach.In a statement to the Associated Press, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said the agency will continue to tackle the troubling epidemic of e-cigarette use among kids.This includes preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavoured tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars, taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market or sell these products to minors, and educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products, he said.But electronic cigarette company Juul, whose headquarters are in the city, oppose the ban - having framed the use of electronic cigarettes as a healthier alternative to traditional smoking tobacco.Juul say they have taken steps to deter children from using their products, describing their online age verication process, which requires e-cig users to enter their date of birth, legal name and permanent address into an age verication form, which is then checked as more robust.They have also shut down their Facebook and Instagram accounts to deter youngsters.Speaking out against the ban, Juul spokesperson Ted Kwong said the prohibition of vapour products for all adults in San Francisco will not effectively address underage use and will leave cigarettes on shelves as the only choice for adult smokers, even though they kill , Calornians every year.The American Vaping Association, like Juul say that the ban deprives adult smokers of less hazardous alternatives, going after youth is a step that you can take before taking these out of the hands of adults, said association president Gregory Conley.The e-cig ban follows a ban on the sale of flavoured tobacco last year, and a tax on sugar sweetened drinks in .However, San Fransisco celebrates its marijuana culture with one journalist describing the city as a hub for world-class cannabis in the same way the city is a meeting place and a destination for top-flight food, wine, and technology.Opposers to the ban also site the effect it will have on small businesses, saying that it could force some shops - who rely on the sale of e-cigs - to close.We need to enforce the rules that we have in place already, said Carlos Solórzano, CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco.San Franciscos mayor, London Breed, has  days to sign off the legislation, but has indicated that she would.

The interview continued with Mr Hunt revealing his passion for the Brazilian dance the Lambada - and over sharing massively.    Mr Hunt - who reportedly has a sprung dancefloor in his home - said that when he was election in  his great passion was lambada dancing. Over sharing, Mr Hunt added: I have to say that this is a dance for single people - it is an intimate dance - so perhaps not one for married listeners. Earlier Mr Hunt spent £ on two milkshakes for the cameras. Sipping the drink from a jar, he said this is some mean milkshake, adding: A big improvement on Nigel Farageaposs milkshake moment. He also bought some white orchids for his we, joking with a market florist: I keep on calling her Japanese when sheaposs actually Chinese - I tell you, I bought a lot of flowers when I did that. An earlier version of this story said Mr Hunt spent £ on a single milkshake. We have since been informed it was £. each on two milkshakes. The Daily Mirror is happy to correct the record.

The meeting between the outgoing PM and Mr Putin was confirmed by the Kremlin. It comes after the British government, and Theresa May , said the Russian government had orchestrated a chemical attack on British soil last year. Mrs May said Mr Putinaposs government was behind the poisoning former Russian spySergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a nerve agent in Salisbury. A woman unconnected to the pair later denied after being exposed to the nerve agent - reportedly a Russian made chemical called novichok. Moscow has denied involvement in the attack, which prompted the biggest wave of diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.    The leaders will talk over sensitive questions - as you know there are many of them ..., Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told  reporters at a briefing. ...any kind of opportunity can be found in our relations with Britain to establish new cooperation, then we will only welcome that, he said. Confirming the meeting, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “The PM’s position on Salisbury and Russia’s wider pattern of malign behaviour is well-known. “As she has said, we remain open to a dferent relationship but that can only happenRussia desists from activity that undermines international treaties and our collective security, like the attack in Salisbury. “This meeting is an opportunity to deliver this message leader to leader, to ensure the UK’s position is fully understood. “Of course there are matters of international security where we continue to engage with Russia when it is in our national interest to do so. “This meeting does not represent a normalisation in relations.” Mrs May last met Putin at a G summit in Argentina in November when Putin approached her informally. Mr Putin said this month that the two countries should turn a page on the Skripal episode and that he hoped the next prime minister would move on from it to improve ties. The CPS have charged two Russian military intelligence officers, known by the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with attempted murder in their absence over the attack.

Dog-mad Richard Remde, , from West Yorkshire, hit headlines in  after they cloned their boxer Dylan to create two new boxer dog puppies in a procedure costing £,. As Mr Remdeaposs beloved cocker spaniel Max began to deteriorate in old age - he decided he wanted to clone him. Then, when Max died at the age of , Mr Remde made sure to retain some cells that would be needed to recreate the animal who had been his first ever pet. The poochaposs DNA was extracted by a specialist vet before he jetted out to South Korea with the sample on ice to be stored until ready for the procedure.    Mr Remde, who has two daughters from a previous marriage, said: Max had been with me through everything. Iaposd had family pets as Iaposd grown up but Max was my first pet, he has seen me go through becoming a father, buying homes and orce, he has always been by my side. I wasnapost definitely sure this is what I wanted to do, but now I know I want to keep a bit of Max with us. Mr Remde and his partner Laura Jacques, , had nine dogs including Max at their home in Silsden, West Yorkshire. The couple currently have a bull Mastf called Harvey, a golden retriever called Chloe, two shih tzus called Dinky and Alfie and two boxer clones called Chance and Shadow, created from their dead predecessor Dylan. They have one of the surrogate mums called Sassie, with the other called Hope, having died - and a mixed breed dog they are raising after rescuing it on a trip to Korea, with a view to rehoming. Maxaposs DNA cloning would be the second time Mr Remde undertook the procedure, having first undertaken when Lauraaposs dog Dylan died aged eight in May . Unable to watch Lauraaposs grief, he remembered an article about cloning and got in touch with Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea.    Laura then took her own samples of DNA, using a kit she purchased from Boots, to take biopsies from Dylanaposs stomach and rushed these to South Korea. These were then used to create cloned puppies through a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. The process starts with an egg harvested from a donor dog on heat, using a high-powered microscope scientists poke a microhole in the egg and remove the nucleus - the DNA. They then replace the nucleus with a cell from the dog being cloned. The hybrid egg is blasted with electricity to fuse the cells and begin cell ision, and the embryo is implanted in a surrogate dog’s womb. The surrogates are dogs rescued from centres across South Korea - they are usually of mixed breed.    Then,the pregnancy is successful, an exact replica puppy of the deceased pet will be born around  days later - theof a canine pregnancy. A few months after that, the puppy is flown to the UK for a ‘cloning reunion’ with the owner of the original dog. Now, Mr Remde is set to head out to Korea to choose his own surrogate mum. The father-of-two said: I am hoping to choose a dog that I can help.  We will be bringing the surrogate dog home with us and we will look after her too, just like we did with Chance and Shadowaposs surrogates. He can then expect to have his cloned Max pup home by Christmas. Luckily for Richard this procedure will only incur his own expenses as he is now an ambassador for the company and is responsible for the English-speaking customers of the company in the west, for which he set up Dog Cloning UK. Richard said Sooam Biotech was a non-profit organisation that used cloning as a way of raising money for research into diseases with hereditary links such as Alzheimer’s and cancer, and its work cloning endangered animal species. He said: The dog cloning is very popular with celebrities lining up to clone their dogs. We are a nation of animal lovers and cherish our dogs.

We also send this information to third party bookers, including Thomas Cook and ask them to share this with customers.” As a scheduled airline, easyJet can sell more tickets than available seats on the plane but they must ask for volunteers before offloading people.

She was torn into pieces. “The owner came around the corner and booted one dog and picked up the one with the cat in its mouth. He took it around the corner into the park. It was dead by then. My we was too distraught. She didn’t get any details from this man. “It’s devastating for our daughter. The cat used to sleep in her room. It’ll take her a while to get over this. “I am so angry.

The controversial new rules at The Hen and Chicken Pub in Bristol appeared on a laminated poster on the pubaposs notice board behind the bar. They apply to all children and teenagers under the age of . The new restrictions state that children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not, and prohibits free roaming, running, scootering, or climbing. The notice adds that children under the age of  are not allowed on the premises after pm, while children aged - can only stay on the premises after pm when having a meal. It furthers asks parents to be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. The Bedminister pub has mixed responses, with some parents championing the pub for being upfront, while others brand it ridiculous.     Pub director James Townend has said he implemented this policy has been in place for more than five years, but that it is going to be more strictly enforced in future. The poster in full reads: Please be aware that as part of out licensing commitment to the safeguarding of children and minors: Children under the age of  are not permitted on the presmises after pm. Children between the ages of    years are only permitted on the premises after pm when having a meal, accompanied by an adult and must depart by pm. - year olds are not permitted on the premises after pm unless attending a performance upstairs and accompanied by an adult. In consideration of all our customers, we do insist that: All children must be sat at a table with an adult at all times, whether dining or not  inside or outside. No free roaming, running, scootering or climbing. Please be mindful to prevent children shouting or screaming. Thank you for your understanding and consideration to our staff and all our customers.    Mr Townend who has been the pub director for a decade said: This is not simply a knee-jerk reaction. As a dad to three sons, I completely understand it can be hard work keeping your children sat down at the pub. Sadly there are a minority of parents who think itaposs okay to relinquish control of their parental responsibilities as soon as they enter the pub, and think itaposs okay for their children to run around screaming and shouting. There are places where children are free to do this such as parks and playgrounds. But when you enter a pub, which has always been seen as an adult domain, there is a responsibility to conform a little bit. We have customers who want to enjoy a nice pint or meal after work without people running around shouting. He also said the new rules can prevent dangers.    Mr Townend said: Letaposs not forget it can also be hazardous. I once picked up a baby who was stood very close to the kitchenaposs swinging door. If I hadnapost have done that, the door could easily swung open and knocked her over. We donapost take steps like this lightly but the issue has been getting worse recently so we felt like something needed to be done. Thereaposs a reasonable level of behaviour we expect from all of our customers regardless of their age. He added that staff have been told to let parents know about the newly enforced rules when they enter, so they can make an informed decision as to whether they would like to stay or go where. He stressed children are still very much welcome in the pub, providing they abide by the rules, adding that the Hen and Chicken is still an important part of the local community. Mum-of-one Jojo Carpenter supports the pubaposs decision. The -year-old said: I think this is absolutely fair enough. Theyaposre basically saying that itaposs really a pub for adults and thataposs fine, I just wouldnapost take my child there. I actually prefer it when establishments are clear and this sign is very clear. Thereaposs nothing worse than walking into a pub with kids and feeling unwelcome, despite the fact there are kidsapos menus on the tables. I would much rather places are upfront like this.    But there are also parents who believe the pub is acting unreasonably. Mum-of-two Emma Grimshaw said: I think the thing about the hours is fair enough but the rest is just totally unrealistic. Thereaposs no way you can get a child to sit down for the whole time, putting that pressure on parents is unfair. How many adults sit down the whole time theyaposre there  And also, did the owners sit still when they were kids  I bet they didnapost. Either ban kids entirely or let kids be kids, they canapost make up ridiculous rules like this. Also letaposs not forget kids arenapost the only ones who are noisy in pubs - students, stag dos and birthday parties all give them a good run for their money. Local pubs cafes and restaurants are meant to be for the whole community, but these new rules goes against that.On Facebook , Natasha Shaddick also shared her disapproval writing: Glad Iaposm not the only one pretty shocked by this!!

But they could be indicators of a food intolerance - and simply by cutting something out of your diet could improve your health and well-being. Experts have now come up with the six most common symptoms that show your body is reacting to a particular food you eat. Often confused with allergies, food intolerances are completely dferent. Symptoms can take up to  hours to present themselves and can y in severity from person to person.    Dr Gill Hart, Biochemist and Scientic Director at YorkTest Laboratories, said: “A food intolerance can occur when your body has trouble digesting certain foods. “When this happens over time, large protein particles from food can enter the blood stream. The immune system sometimes sees these particles as a threat and produces antibodies to ‘attack’ them. “Your body’s immune system responds by creating inflammation. It’s this inflammation which can trigger symptoms which,left untreated, can develop over time and may cause symptoms.” Here are six signs you may have a food intolerance.    . Tiredness or fatigue The most common cause of tiredness is lack of sleep but science has shown food and drink can have a big impact on your energy levels.Dr Hart said: “Many people associate food intolerances with digestive issues such as bloating and irritable bowel syndrome .“However, fatigue and low energy are also symptoms of a food intolerance. “In fact, one in five people who came to YorkTest for testing last year did so because they were experiencing tiredness.” . Itchy skin or eczemaFood intolerances can also contribute to skin related complaints, Dr Hart says. She added: “If you are experiencing prolonged bouts of itchy skin without an obvious cause, it could be a good idea to look at your diet. “People who tend to develop eczema are categorised as being ‘atopic’, which means they have an overactive immune system, causing their skin to easily become inflamed. “If there is something you are eating which is causing inflammation in the body, there is a possibility that this can impact your skin, meaning maintaining an eczema-friendly diet could be key in managing flare-ups.”  . IBS symptoms Symptoms of irritable bowel syndromeinclude abdominal pains, excess wind, bloating and constipation. IBS can be triggered by certain foods which irritate the digestive system and can also be a symptom of food intolerance. Dr Hart said: “Studies have found that irritable bowel is linked to a hypersensitive gut and many people find relief through eliminating certain foods from their diet.”  . Joint pain Do you have general aches and pains that can’t be explained by an underlying condition It might be wise to look at what you are eating. Dr Hart said: “If you experience general joint pain it might be worth considering what part your diet has to play because a food intolerance could be contributing to these problems.”According to the Arthritis Association, what you eat can cause inflammation in the body and joints, which can lead to pain.They say foods that can cause inflammation include sugar, saturated fats and trans fats, which is found in foods such as pizza and cheese.  . Anxiety If you constantly feel anxious it could be worth taking a look at what youaposre putting in your body. Dr Hart said: “Research has shown that gastrointestinal inflammation, one of the most frequent symptoms of food intolerance, is frequently found in those showing signs of depression and anxiety. “The relationship between the gut and mental health is often bi-directional.This means thatyou’re feeling depressed the health of your digestive system is likely to suffer, andyou’re having gastro troubles the chance of experiencing depression and anxiety increases. “Reactions to foods y a great deal from person to person and an ingredient which may cause problems for one person might be fine for another. “We call this our personal ‘food fingerprint’, and this is why food intolerances can be so dficult to pinpoint without help.”  . MigrainesMigraines are throbbing, intense headaches which can also be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, noise or smell.The University of York conducted a survey to understand the benefits of elimination diets based on the results of a food intolerance test. Out of  people who reported experiencing migraines,  per cent reported an improvement having removed their ‘trigger’ foods.

The LSEaposs Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment today released its prediction, in a bid to warn Brits to take precautions ahead of the scorcher of a weekend. The instituteaposs number-crunchers have based the grim figure on data charting heatwave-related deaths reported by public health authorities previously.    Despite wet and thundery conditions set to affect much of England imminently, the Met Office has issued a danger heath health alert warning conditions will turn sharply later in the week, which can have dire consequences for vulnerable people such as the elderly.The research instituteaposs analysis refers to official figures published by Public Health Englandpreviously, which show that , deaths across England were linked to summer hot weather over the past three years.During the devastating summer  heatwave, authorities recorded more than , excess deaths over ten sweltering August days. PHE has over previous years warned that hot weather is related to at least , deaths every year in England.    Parts of Europe are also on alert as scientist are warning more potentially deadly heatwaves are in store thanks to warm air from Africa set to settle in later this week.The record-breaking extreme temperatures are being predicted to soar higher than C in parts of Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium this week.The Grantham Research Institutesaposs analysts say these deaths are preventable - urging Britons vulnerable in the heat to take precautions based on this weekendaposs weather forecast. What the experts say Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “With daytime temperatures forecast to be close to  degrees Celsius by the end of the week, there could be many deaths, particularly among vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from serious respiratory illnesses. Based on experience of the past three summers, during which over  extra deaths occurred during bouts of hot weather, more than  deaths could be expected over the weekend. “Many of these deaths are preventableextra precautions are taken to protect those most at risk from overheating in their homes and other buildings, both during the day and at night.    The Met Office and Public Health England have already issued a Level  Heat Health Alert to warn people of the potential dangers. “We know from research by the Met Office that the frequency of summer heatwaves and hot weather conditions has been increasing because of climate change. Last summer was the second warmest on record for the UK, and Met Office researchers have estimated that it was made  times more likely by climate change. The UK’s  warmest years have all occurred since .” What you can do to ward off dangerous heat   Mr Ward said while British authorities had become better at managing hot weather risks since the events of the deadly  heatwave, more could still be done. He recommended Brits adapt homes for summertime heat, including by installing air conditioners and attaching external windows. He also urged authorities to introduce measures to prevent overheating, including regulations to ensure homes and workplaces were constructed to ward off overheating in hot weather. “Those who live and work in London and other cities are particularly exposed to the risks of heatwaves because the surfaces of roads and buildings tend to absorb more sunlight and convert it into heat compared with surrounding countryside, he added. London Climate Action Week, beginning on July , will highlight the impacts of climate change like more frequent heatwaves which create increased risk from hot weather for people who live and work in the capital.    How hot is it forecast to get this weekend  Temperatures are expected to climb as high as C this weekend as the heatwave spreading over parts of Europe makes itself felt in Britain. An enormous reservoir of warm air that has triggered emergency measures in France is due to send the mercury shooting skywards, with temperatures peaking on Saturday. Highs of C could be seen for eastern parts as far north as Yorkshire, while temperatures will be in the upper s for revellers at the Glastonbury Festival. Western parts are expected to see the better weather on Friday, while the picture will switch around on Saturday. Met Office forecaster Matthew Box said: We are looking at  or  degrees, perhaps peaking at  here or there on Friday and that will be across western or south-western parts of the UK.    Then we could see  or  across eastern areas of England London and the Home Counties through Lincolnshire and parts of Yorkshire, on Saturday. The blast of warm weather has led some meteorologists to predict new June records will be set in France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium in the coming days. France has been bracing for the heatwave, with temporary fountains put in place and plans for public pools to stay open for longer, amid forecasts suggesting temperatures could exceed C this week. The hot spell is set to be relatively short-lived in the UK, with unsettled weather moving in from the Atlantic on Sunday. PHE has been approached for comment.

Laura Hood claimed innocent cabbie Haroon Yousaf launched a sex attack as he drove her home from a night out in Manchester with her friends. Hood, who got in the car alone, claimed the then -year-old married father took a detour during the journey, pulled into a side street and raped her. But the jury saw through her  allegation and today the -year-old was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.  She had maintained for more than two-and-a-half years that she had been attacked by a taxi driver before she finally accepted at her trial last week that it could not have happened. But she continued to deny the allegation against her and said she was innocent because she had not knowingly lied, and instead had a  belief of something so clear in my head. However, a consultant forensic psychiatrist saw Hood, of Stockport, as part of the case, and concluded there was no medical or psychiatric explanation for her belief. A jury at Manchester Minshull Street Crown found Hood guilty by a - majority verdict after deliberating for more than six hours. Shortly after being dropped off home following a night out, Hood hysterically told her mother she had been sexually assaulted and then informed police she was attacked in the back of a black cab in a side-street.  Her version of events fell apart when a tracker device fitted to the cab showed the vehicle made no detours apart from when Hood jumped out briefly to use a cash machine. Prosecutor Geoff Whelan said Mr Yousaf, could have found himself on trial for rape without the tracker data from the early hours of January , . Mr Yousaf was kept in custody for  hours after he was arrested at a taxi rank that evening. A second man was also arrested as he drove a taxi with a similar registration number. He spent some  hours in custody. Both suspects provided intimate samples as part of the investigation before they were later told no further action would be taken, jurors were told. In a witness statement read to the court, Mr Yousaf said: It still affects me in my day-to-day le. I donapost knowI will ever come back fully from this.  Before this incident I was a strong person. However Iaposm now negative and worry that things can go wrong. This is the most disgusting thing that anyone can be accused of. When I pick up single female passengers I always worry that something could happen again. The married father said he had tears in my eyes when he had to take his clothes off in front of a stranger and provide a sample in custody. He added: I donapost think this female really understands what she has done and how it has affected my le. The court heard how Hood maintained she had been raped despite being confronted with the vehicle tracker data. She also kept to her story when it was revealed Mr Yousaf was aged  at the time - and not in his s as she had described - and he had a full beard when she said her attacker had no facial hair. No forensic evidence gathered showed any physical contact between Mr Yousaf and the defendant.  Giving evidence, Hood said le was absolutely fine before she made the complaint, having started a new relationship and a new job in human resources for a legal company. She described how she got into a real state after losing her phone on a night out with friends in Manchester city centre and decided to get a taxi home alone. She tearfully recalled how she went on to be examined by a doctor at a sexual assault referral centre, which she described as awful. Hood said she had absolutely no idea how male DNA found on her underwear was not conclusively connected to any named person in the court case. Accepting there was no explanation for her belief, she said: I wish I knew. I wish I could explain why something so clear in my head ... obviously it canapost be true. The Crown said Hood had stuck with her lies for so long and events had snowballed. Hood leaned forward in the dock and held her head in her hands following the verdict. Thanking the jury, Judge Julie Warburton said: It is quite apparent to me that it has not been easy for any of you.Hood, of Onslow Road, was bailed until August  for a pre-sentence report and cried as she exited the courtroom. Before she left, the judge told her: Adjourning the case for a report should not be taken as any indication that there will be not be a custodial sentence in this case. It is a very serious matter. Detective Constable Laura Hughes of GMP’s Police Protection Investigation Unit said: “Hood put a completely innocent man through a dreadful ordeal. “She showed a complete lack of regard for how her  accusation would affect him and remained emotionless when police confronted her with irrefutable evidence that she was making the whole thing up. “She has wasted the time of specialist police officers and detectives who could have been dedicating their efforts to solving real crimes and supporting real victims. “Rape and sexual offences are among the most intrusive and le-changing crimes to become a victim of. Clearly, Hood thought that they could be treated as something trivial, and made a  report on whim. “The real victim here was the taxi driver and I hope he finds some closure with today’s verdict.” "},{"url":null,"title":"simple trick perfectly folding fitted","story":"NewsSimple trick for perfectly folding a fitted sheet is blowing peoples mindsA homeware retail assistant has shared an easy method for perfectly folding your fitted sheetsShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video simple-six-step-method-perfectly-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email We all love nothing more than getting into bed after putting freshly washed sheets on.But in between washes, folding and storing the fitted sheet can be a real nightmare.

And she does it in several easy to follow steps. Kris starts by telling people watching at home that sheaposs going to take them back to basics before getting into the technique.  Hereaposs a look at how she does it: . The first step sees you put a hand inside two corners of the shorter side of the sheet and place the whole thing down on a flat surface. . Then, take your hands out and place your fingers on the outside corners at the other end of the sheet and push them inside out. . Next, with your fingers still on the inside of those corners, match the ends up by tucking them inside each other. . The fourth step involves gathering the ends of the elastic, corner to corner before picking the sheet up through the middle and shaking it out.    . After this, place your right hand into the right corner of the sheets and tuck your left hand over the other corner. Lay it down on a flat surface again - by now it should be forming a nice rectangle shape. . Take one side of the sheet and foldways into the middle, repeat with the other side, before folding over the other way two or three times to make a neat square of sheets. Written down it sounds much more complicated than it actually is, so make sure to watch Kris demonstrating the technique before you give it a go!Have you got a household hack to share  Email yourmirror@mirror"},{"url":null,"title":"you can now buy scented","story":"NewsYou can now buy scented flatulence pills which make farts smell like rosesIf you know someone who can empty a room with the smell of their farts, this might be the perfect present for themShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUN NewsChristian Poincheval has invented scented fart pills \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA French man claims to have invented a pill which can transform the smell of your farts.

The Masai Mara is an evocative African wildle haven that boasts one of the worlds great concentrations of predatory big cats.    Retired Scientist Steven Underwood who was staying at the Kicheche Mara camp, captured the brawl on camera. The  year-old who hails from Ashland, Massachusetts said: As a keen amateur photographer, I am a frequent visitor to the Masai Mara in Kenya for its unparalleled photographic opportunities. It is a remarkable experience to be close to lions and other wild animals while on an African safari.  While photographing in Africa, I am privileged occasionally to witness something extraordinary. This insane fight between two magnicent, powerful male lions was astonishing. Nothing can prepare you for the drama and ferocity of a fight between these incredible animals. I will never forget the insanity of their exposed teeth and claws, and the crazed expression in their eyes as they threw themselves at each other !    Lions are revered as kings of their domain and powerful predators. Tragically, their populations are plummeting, largely due to conflict with humans and loss of their habitat.

The emaciated man was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken spine from his fight with the brown bear, say reports. He told doctors a large predator had overpowered him.    “The bear preserved me as food for later,” he is reported to have said. The footage has not been independently veried by the Mirror. He drank his own urine to survive, he said. Medics say it is a “miracle” that he is alive. A group of Russian hunters claim to have found Alexander after their dogs barked and refused to move on from a bear den they passed in the forest in mountainous Tuva. The region is favoured by Vladimir Putin for vacations.    The hunters checked inside the lair and saw what they believed was a human mummy - until they released he was alive. “The man remembers his first name but not his age and was reportedly in the den for around one month - drinking urine to survive,” reported The Siberian Times. A hospital video shows the bearded man opening his blue eyes and confirming his first name. He was described as having “severe injuries and rotting tissue” from lying motionless for so long in the den. “Local medics say they cannot explain how the man survived such injuries,” said the report.  The exact location where he was found has not been revealed, nor the name of the hospital where he was treated. A spokesman at the health ministry in Tuva Republic, a region in southern Siberia, said: “We cannot confirm the case happened in Tuva. “It was not registered by the Ministry of Health, the Emergencies Ministry or any other official body . “Most probably, it happened somewhere outside Tuva.” The man was spoken to by medical staff in Russian rather than the local Tuvan language. Brown bears are known to hide their prey andto feast on it later.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":null,"title":"blether rabbie reminisces about game in carnoustie at old westfield park","story":"The Dundee Schoolboys stories, which featured so prevalently in this column in February and March, was instigated by Rabbie Ogg.Now another story has caught his eye.Rabbie opened: “I was reading your recent story regarding a father and son goalkeeping story of them both scoring goals.“The father was Paul Gibb and the son Craig.“Seeing this took me back to the late s when I was playing for Lochee United – and a certain Paul Gibb was the young goalkeeper at the time.“We had a game at Carnoustie, playing at the old Westfield Park.“Paul had been going through a patchy bit of form at the time.“In the pre-match team talk, the manager Peter Castle was warning Paul that the conditions were poor, with heavy rain falling.“He emphasised it was critical Paul maintained his concentration throughout the match.“As Carnoustie kicked off in torrential rain, they passed the ball back to their goalkeeper, and he proceeded to launch a long kick down the pitch,“Paul came out his goal, but, unfortunately for him, the ball skidded off the turf bounced over his head into the goal.“The whole Lochee team stood astounded at going -

McInnes wanted a left-back signed before the Europa League opener with Finnish side RoPS Rovaniemi at Pittodrie on July .Former Manchester City youngster Leigh flew out to Cork to meet up with the Dons at their training camp.Leigh said: “My conversations with the manager were very positive and productive.“He has a very interesting and good approach to the game.“When we talked about what my role would be he said he wanted to use my strengths.“That really that really attracted me because he understands what type of player I am.“I am athletic and like to go forward.“I have a decent spring in the air and am passionate.“The manager also talked about what kind of team he wants to build and where I would fit in.“That was a major attraction.”The former England U- international came through the Manchester City academy before moving to Bradford City.Despite being offered a new contract by Bradford after his first season there he opted to sign for League One Bury where he spent two seasons.In summer  he moved to NAC Brada in the Dutch top flight on a three year deal where he played  times, scoring once.However NAC Brada were relegated at the end of the season.He said: “Last season was tough being relegated, it’s never easy when you are in a negative environment with regards to where you sit in the league.“When you are around the bottom it is always tough to pick the team up every week and get things going.“On a personal level for me it wasn’t quite what I was hoping for as I was hoping for much more of a positive season.“It didn’t quite work out that way.“But all you can do is pick yourself up and dust yourself down and that is what I have done.“Hopefully I am l have more of a successful season here at Aberdeen.“I am driven. I want to be successful.“Last year was a struggle for me on a personal level but I am excited to be producing at the right end of the league with Aberdeen and winning games.”The full-back is McInnes’ sixth signing of the summer following the capture of Ryan Hedges, Curtis Main, Ash Taylor, Craig Bryson and Jon Gallagher .McInnes had been keen to secure a third loan deal for Derby’s Max Lowe but that the left-back looks like remaining at Pride Park.Celtic have made an approach to talk to Derby about capturing Lowe and Rangers are also interested in the -year-old.The managerial position at Derby also complicated matters with Rams boss Frank Lampard set to be named new Cha manager.Leigh is set to make his Dons’ debut in Saturday’s friendly against Connah’s Quay Nomads of Wales at the Fota Island resort in Cork.It is the first friendly of the pre-season as the build up to the Euro clash with RoPS steps up.Leigh admits playing in Europe was a major draw in joining the Dons.He said: “Every player wants to play at the highest level and Europe is an attraction for me.“I am excited to get going.”Leigh will have a year left on his NAC Brada contract when his loan deal expires at the end of the season.There is an option at the end of the loan to make the deal permanent and he is open to that.On a potential permanent move he said: “It is definitely a possibility to look at in the future.”Leigh spent more than ten years with English Champions Manchester City and made his debut for the senior side during a pre-season tour in the UAE against Al Ain in .That summer he also featured for City in friendly games against Dundee, Hearts and Sporting Kansas City.Manager McInnes said: “We’ve been aware of Greg for a while.“When it looked as though Maxwas staying at Derby, he was someone we were quite far down the road with.“He’s versatile, gives us a bit of athleticism, has decent experience for someone with his best years ahead of him and he sees Aberdeen as the right move at this stage.“There were a number of clubs in England keen to take Greg but I felt he bought into what we’re trying to do early on in our

while playing for the Reds, on loan from Watford, against St Mirren on February .The -year-old is undergoing his rehab privately with a physio following surgery and his release by the English Premier League Hornets.But the Evening Express reported yesterday that Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes has offered Hoban the chance to complete his recovery at Pittodrie.The Dons gaffer has previously said he would be interested in signing Hobanhe was a free agent and fully fit.Devlin believes it would be beneficial for the Republic of Ireland under- international to step up his battle back to fitness in the Granite City – and that’s because he has done the same.Aberdeen signed Devlin from Hamilton Accies in January  when he was still recovering from an ACL injury sustained in May .The -year-old completed his rehab with the Dons before making his debut last July in Europa League against English Premier League Burnley.Devlin remains grateful to McInnes and the Reds for signing him during his recovery and allowing him to get back to fitness at Pittodrie.He said: “I think it was huge for me to do my rehab here.“When I spoke to the gaffer he stressed the importance of that.“I bought into that and was able to come and work under the medical staff, the gaffer and the boys.“It meant I could see what they were all about and when I came back for pre-season I felt ready to go.“It meant I wasn’t trying to settle in during pre-season and that was really important for me.“It was a big step and that’s something I’ll always owe the gaffer for.“He took me in and gave me that opportunity and I’ll always owe him for taking that gamble on me.“Every day I’m at the club I’ll try to repay that faith he showed in me.”Devlin was on the pitch when Hoban, who also ruptured an ACL in training with Watford in , was injured against the Buddies and tried to support him in the immediate aftermath.He saysHoban needs any advice during his recovery he will be happy to help.And Devlin would recommend doing his rehab with the medical staff at Pittodrie after they helped get him back to fitness a year ago.The man who was called into the Scotland squad for Euro qualiers against Cyprus and Belgium earlier this month added: “I tried to support Tommie when he went down with that injury on the pitch.“When it happened I had a feeling I knew what it was.“I’ve been there twice before and I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone to go through that.“But particularly Tommie, who is a brilliant guy and a brilliant player.“I was gutted for him having to go through that, but I’ve tried to help him.“If he needed any advice or wanted to talk about anything I was available because I’d been in that situation.“If I can help anybody with that experience then I’m happy to do it. If Tommie has the option to come here when he’s still doing his rehab I would encourage him to do that.“If he gets the opportunity to come back I would love him to do that because it worked for me.“The medical staff got me fit and back playing.“I would trust them with my le.“Sothey could do the same for Tommie it would be great and what a player we’d have on our hands going forward.“Sothat happened I would love it.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43765734-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43765734-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43765734-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43765734-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"affordable homes plan approved for north east town","story":"A plan to build  affordable homes in a north-east town has been approved.The site in Keith previously had consent for  affordable homes, but Moray Council’s planning and regulatory services committee has now given the go ahead for  houses and  flats.The development on Banff Road is to be built in three phases, and will see a mixture of two, three, four and five-bedroom properties.

Lumsden promising to focus on the day job while seeking to walk away from his role as co-leader of the council won’t be lost on people in Aberdeen.“The reality is that being a leader of Aberdeen City Council is a hugely important role that requires % commitment – something Douglas Lumsden appears unconcerned about.“Ultimately, every project delay, service cut and funding raid on the likes of Visit Aberdeenshire stems from the pen of Douglas Lumsden – that record will not serve him well at the polls.”Mr Stewart, who currently holds the seat at Holyrood, said: “I am proud that during my time as MSP for Aberdeen Central the SNP Government has delivered the £ million Western Peripheral Route, is building a new women’s hospital and cancer care unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and has invested £ million in the Aberdeen City Region Deal compared to the lesser sum of £ million from the UK Tories.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43765734-240x180.jpg

#strategy has reached a draft stage# when an Autism Strategy for Argyll and Bute already exists.It was commissioned by the council, produced in May  and signed off by council members. An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

I love working with the tools and lining textures and patterns that come out.#It#s something to pursue in the future as an artist. I hope to go into art therapy or teaching art and do printmaking in my personal work.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Party left for Newstead and Trimontium to meet the stone masons who built the historic abbey and the Romans who created a camp in the shadow of the Eildon Hills.History dating back two millennia was played out before the eyes of the latest generation to call these lands their home.Continuing their journey through time, the Festival Queen and her Court along with the Melrosian arrived at Gattonside, the site of the Monks south-facing orchards during their residency at the nearby Abbey.Following the customary sampling of the cherries, the Festival party headed to a more recent addition to Melroses patchwork of the past, Abbotsford.The home of Sir Walter Scott allows the Festival to honour the rich relationship between the great writer and his neighbouring town.Darnick Peel is the

Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised. In many areas the level of nursery provision simply isnrsquot there and independent nurseries are already struggling financially with the planned expansion."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-double-yellow-lines-at-busy-haddington-junction","story":"Parked vehicles regularly line Hopetoun Drive and Rab Moran, from the townrsquos community council,

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

deep Southern Ocean, one of the largest repositories of carbon dioxide on the planet.Dr Uisdean Nicholson and Professor Dorrik Stow from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh combined seismic surveys off the Falkland Islands and data from sediment cores extending several hundred metres below the seabed to calculate when the ACC began, dating it to around  million years ago.:Climate Emergency:

profound importance for Antarctica and the global climate.ldquoWe now know it began around  million years ago.ldquoWe know there was a sudden onset of very strong currents because we can see a phase of pronounced erosion in the deep ocean and the formation of a giant deep-water sand sheet, which was transported and deposited by the current.ldquoThis coincides with the time that major glaciers began to form in Antarctica and is consistent with many scientistsrsquo belief that the thermal isolation of Antarctica by this current was fundamental to the onset of glaciation.:Global heating: Extra poundm to restore Scottish peatlandsHe added: ldquoSo Antarctica didnrsquot freeze solely because of decreasing C levels ndash the new current played a major role.ldquoAt some point in the last

ldquoUnderstanding the oceanographic events of that era and how they changed will help us predict future changes and feedbacks between oceans and the atmosphere in a warming world.The new research,

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance.

It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The importance of determining the character, judgement and temperament of the man tipped to be our next prime minister ought to be self-evident. There was a time, I am sure, when it was. But in today’s toxic and corruptive climate, where fundamental concerns for a woman’s welfare and a belief in holding public figures to account are deliberately mischaracterised as politicised acts of aggression, it cannot be stated enough.Mr Johnson has refused to ­comment on whatever series of events led Ms Symonds to reportedly shout, ‘Get off me’, and ‘Get out of my flat’. His silence is unacceptable. It is also intriguing, given his long and inglorious track record of downplaying controversies and exploiting the bumbling self-caricature he has meticulously cultivated. But he is wily enough to know that the less he says on the matter, the more others will talk about it, and so deflect from another scandal looming on the horizon – one which could, and should, threaten to mete out the greatest damage to his ­ruthless ambition. A newly-published video shows Steve Bannon, the far right agitator and former campaign manager to Donald Trump, talking freely of how he helped craft the Commons speechMr Johnson gave when resigning as foreign secretary last year. Its contents ought to prove especially instructive for those who argue the focus of the Tory leadership contest should be on Mr ­Johnson’s policies, as opposed to his personal le. Here is a video where we not only gain an insight into his ideology, but those who claim to be shaping it. In the footage, shot in July last year by US documentary film maker, Alison Klayman and disclosed by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, Mr Bannon is seen lolling in a London hotel, leafing through a copy of the Dailyand ­discussing how he had a hand in Mr Johnson’s final act as a member of Prime Minister Theresa May’s ­cabinet. “Today we are going to seeBoris Johnson tries to overthrow the ­British government, he’s going to give a speech in the Commons,” Mr Bannon tells the camera. “I’ve been talking to him all weekend about this speech. We went back and forth over the text.”Asked by Ms Klaymanhe and Mr Johnson had been speaking over the phone, Mr Bannon replied: “Talked to him initially over the phone then it’s just easier to go back and forth on text. It’s just easier.”He later says that he had been ­telling the right honourable ­member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip “all weekend” that he ought to “incorporate those themes” he focused on in a June  speech, where he described the day of the EU referendum as Britain’s ­“independence day”. All of which rather sticks a spike in the spokes of the column Mr Johnson wrote for the Dailyin April this year, in which he scoffed at his “so-called association” with Mr Bannon and dismissed it as a “lefty delusion whose spores continue to breed in the Twittersphere”. In the wake of the latest report, a spokesman for Mr Johnson saidthe suggestion he was taking advice from Mr Bannon was “totally ­preposterous”, while Mr Johnson himself said yesterday the idea was “codswallop”. How curious it was, then, to hear Nigel Farage inform a press ­conference that Mr Bannon knows Mr Johnson, and that the two men speak.If anyone knows, he does.In isolation, the video might appear innocuous enough, butyou have either forgotten or are unaware of how Mr Bannon came to occupy such a position of influence, a quick summary follows. Sober profiles of the -year-old bill him as a key proponent of the US president’s economic nationalist agenda. A more precise description of Mr Bannon would frame him as an architect of chaos and ision, whose political appetites will only be sated by the dismantling of the state and, with it, common decency.He is a man who has done more than anything  to legitimise the alt-right movement in the US. This is someone who told a National Front rally that accusations of racism should be worn “as a badge of honour”. He is, in short, a virulent ­presence. The fact that he has the ear of Britain’s prime minister in waiting ought to be of deep concern to the One Nation Tories Mr Johnson ­purports to represent, and the ­public at large. It is, of course, impossible to know just how in thrall Mr Johnson is to him, but it is perhaps telling that around the time of their conversations last year, the former’s feckless bongo thumping rhetoric assumed a darker hue, taking on the slower, steadier drumbeat of populist ­nativism. He compared a Muslim woman wearing a niqab to a “bank robber,” and compared Britain’s negotiating position with the EU over the Irish border to wrapping “a suicide vest around the British ­constitution”.Mr Johnson has shown himself to be extraordinarily proficient in causing upset and unrest in the society he hopes to lead, buthe is receiving directions as he steers a wrecking ball towards Downing Street, the excuses he has relied on so far to maintain an undignied silence just won’t cut it. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"murdo fraser why nicola sturgeon may end up like thatcher","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Thatcher believed her position was unassailable but she was eventually seen as aloof, out of touch and unable to listen # and the same applies to Nicola Sturgeon, writes Murdo Fraser.Watching the ­excellent BBC series The Thatcher Revolution brought back memories for those of us who lived through that turbulent period in British politics. As a Young Conservative in the late s, I knew many of the key players in the latter stages of Margaret Thatcher’s period in office.I can recall making a rather ­precocious speech at the Conservative Party Conference in  on the risks of poll tax implementation, and being cornered that night at the YC dance by the Leaderene herself, who sought me out to ­discuss my views. She did enjoy a good ­argument, as did I. We parted on good terms, but history would prove me right.By that point in her leadership, as this excellent documentary series made clear, Maggie was starting to lose her grip. In office for ten years, after three unprecedented general election victories, she had started to believe that she was invincible and had a monopoly on wisdom. Whilst others might see that it was time for her to move on, there was, in her view, simply no one  capable of doing the job. She was increasingly disengaged from her backbenchers, seen as aloof, out of touch and unprepared to listen. When challenged for the leadership by Michael Heseltine, her team assumed that Conservative MPs would rally to her support. But they were wrong – by this stage it was too late to make up ground, and the Iron Lady was toppled. It is a salutary lesson to all leaders not to lose touch with their footsoldiers. I wonderNicola Sturgeon had time to watch the series, and saw any parallels with her own position. It is becoming a common ­complaint amongst SNP ­backbenchers at Holyrood that the First ­Minister is out of touch. Some are ­positively salivating at the prospect of the upcoming Alex Salmond trial which, they believe, might prove to be a career-ending moment for her. There is open debate about who might replace her as First Minister in that event.There are disagreements within the SNP about tactics for a second independence referendum, with some feeling that the First ­Minister is simply too cautious in her approach. But the issue which has done most to expose the ­disconnect between her leadership and her backbenchers has been the debate around reform of the ­Gender Recognition Act. This seemingly uncontroversial move to simply the process of gender change has become heated and highly ­politicised. A number of women’s group have raised concerns about the conflation of the quite dferent concepts of biological sex and gender identity, which potentially leads to fully male-bodied iniduals accessing women-only spaces. There has been a furious debate, not just on social media, around these issues, with misogynistic slurs such as ‘TERF’ and “cisgender” being thrown around, the feminist icon Germaine Greer being no-ed from universities, women’s meetings picketed, and even allegations that those opposing GRA reforms have been physically assaulted by trans activists.These broader concerns are reflected on the SNP benches at Holyrood, with the MSP Joan McAlpine being a courageous, and outspoken, critic of the pace of reform. She is by no means alone. A signicant group of SNP ­backbenchers feel that their worries about these issues are being ignored by a First Minister whose strong personal commitment to GRA reform means that she is simply not listening to other voices.In last week’s statement made to Parliament on the way forward in this area, there were some signs of softening in the Scottish Government’s stance, with a promise of ­further consultation and consideration of the way forward, in an effort to build wider consensus. But the feeling remains thatconcerned SNP MSPs had not gone public with their criticisms, in some cases risking their careers to do so, then they would have been ignored by an out-of-touch First Minister. It is still not impossible that we could see ministerial resignations on the issue, such is the strength of ­opinion in some quarters.The Alex Salmond situation, the referendum strategy, and the ­gender identity issue, are all areas where there is serious discontent within the SNP with the First Minister’s approach. Despite all her successes, ­Margaret Thatcher found that ­losing touch with her backbenchers was eventually fatal to her leadership.

The truth of the matter is that the erse needs within Scotland need to be accommodated. Within a flexible policy framework based on reality rather than academic theory.The fishing communities of the northeast Scotland have far more in common with their equivalents in the southwest of England than they do with the industrial heartland of the central belt. Similarly that economy has more in common with the west midlands than the remote island communities of the Hebrides.Simply transferring responsibility for Scotland’s immigration to Holyrood as the SNP propose, entirely misses the pointof how a UK wide approach will ensure a positive environment to attract the people our economy needs. We cannot afford to have dferent systems operatingwithin a United Kingdom where people must be able to move freely around within it.: My faith makes me no less Scottish - Stephen Kerr MP That being said the current proposals for a future immigration policy will causereal damage to the UK economy and must be changed.The most obvious problem is that it excludes everyone who earns less than £, a year, classying them as “unskilled”. Some of the most skilled people I know earn less than k . With the average salary in Scotland being just under £, these proposals would wrongly classy the majority of Scots as “unskilled”.That would be a travesty. Nothing could be further from the truth. The people who run our hotels, maintain our national infrastructure and care for our elderly are skilled, they are hard working and they are compassionate.These are the qualities that we want to attract with our immigration policy. A simple salary cut off point is far too blunt an instrument to deal with the problems we have in attracting and retaining talent across the Scottish economy.The Tourism and Hospitality Sector is an excellent example. These businesses need to be able to attracttalented people from around the world.They must have the ability to grow and increase the value that tourism adds to our economy. In my constituency the hotels, tourist attractionsand the outdoor activity sector need staff who have the qualities needed.We must havean immigration policy that works for those businesses.Similarlycompanies needing pharmaceutical lab assistants, food production technicians, moulding engineers, fitters and construction staff, to name just a few, cannot afford to be excluded from accessing the people they need.To label all these people as “unskilled labour” is simply wrong.A top priority for the new Prime minister must be to insist on a flexible and adaptive immigration policy that accommodates the needs of UK business in all of its complex ersity.Whether that be agriculture, tourism, building, Care, manufacturing or any other sector it needs to take account of sectoral needs and move away from a simple earnings thresehold.By yet again focussing on constitutional arguments the SNP continue to let Scotland downand fail to stand up for our interests in the UK.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives finally revealed in report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels.

These included a two-night trip to Paradise Island resort in January , just three weeks before his official trip on behalf of the government.  It also obtained internal records showing that two years earlier, Mr Paisley had travelled to the Males for a luxury holiday with his we and two children at one of the country’s most exclusive resorts.According to Spotlight, the family stayed free of charge at the Kandolhu Island Resort in April , which had recently opened following a multi-million pound refurbishment.Social media posts made by Fiona Paisley appeared to back up the claims.In April , five days after the trip, Mrs Paisley reportedly tweeted: “No more holiday mode” complete with a palm tree emoji.In , she commented on posts on the Kandolhu Resort’s Facebook page, writing: “Take me back” and “Remembering that view ... bliss”.Mr Paisley was previously suspended from the House of Commons for  sitting days for serious misconduct after he failed to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in .He also narrowly avoided facing a by-election after Parliament’s first ever recall petition fell short of the number of constituent signatures required to oust him by around .Mr Paisley has not responded to the new claims made in last night’s Spotlight.A DUP spokesperson told the BBC: “Discipline is an internal party matter.“We do not give a running commentary.“All members are treated fairly and have a right to due process.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp shannon to be investigated again over parliamentary expenses","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38254594.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/press_1-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"paisley faces holiday claims backlash sf and sdlp demand answers as dup to consider serious issues raised","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was fined  pounds.Her case became known after she was interviewed for an RTE radio documentary.She has attempted suicide five times in the time since, and receives a discounted pension due to leaving the force on health grounds.Ms Clford-Lee said: “Majella Moynihan’s story reflects the distressing reality of what le was like for women in Ireland not so long ago.“It was heartbreaking listening to her, joining the guards she felt liberated from her upbringing, and instead of that bright future she was doled out horrible abuse, interrogated and forced to give her baby up.“She was treated like a scarlet woman by colleagues, and told by an Assistant Garda Commissioner in  her career would go nowhere because of her history.”Ms Clford-Lee highlighted Ms Moynihan does not receive a full Garda pension, and asked the Commissionerhe would now support a full pension payment.“These are matters now the subject of negotiations with solicitors, and I wish to reserve my position,” Mr Harris replied.Ms Moynihan was given a redacted version of a personal file in , and was told the unredacted version had been lost or destroyed.The Garda Commissioner met with Ms Moynihan last week at Garda Headquarters to apologise for the treatment she endured.“I did meet with Majella and her solicitor and it was very clear any communication from here on was all to go through her solicitor,” Mr Harris added.“We do have files, retrieved from electronic storage, the original files have been subject to a weeding process, but an electronic copy was taken.“It’s hard to sayit’s complete, from what I saw it’s a pretty full account.”He told the committee that the  files handed over are subject to data protection law and the redactions include third-party names.The Commissioner said he was sure what happened to Ms Moynihan could never happen within the force today.“All told, it is a shocking story and a tale from the past that couldn’t happen now, and I want to make it clear to iniduals that An Garda Siochana is an open and inclusive environment and I want to make that clear to the public and those who wish to join.”"},{"url":null,"title":"government to analyse eirs broadband claims varadkar tells dail","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It has committed to spending  billion euro on the project.“This is a big turnaround,” Mr Varadkar said.“The company is now saying that it can do this project for  billion euro andthat’s the case I’m all ears and we have to listen to it.“We need to knowthis offer is real, we need to knowit stacks up. We need to know what kind of delay would be imposed on people in rural Ireland waiting for broadbandwe went back to a new procurement process. There would have to be a new procurement process.”Mr Varadkar said one of his concerns was that the cost savings Eir was offering would be met by imposing higher charges on the , homes, farms and businesses in rural areas.He said any higher charges or fees to customers would be a “serious problem” for the Government.The Taoiseach was speaking after the leader of the opposition accused the Government of being “too dismissive” of Eir’s claim that it could deliver the National Broadband Plan for less than a billion euro.Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin welcomed the Government’s decision to look at what Eir was offering.But Mr Martin claimed former communications minster Denis Naughten “got too close to the Granahan McCourt consortium and the political and electoral imperative took over and the issue of costs went out the window”.He said costs had “ballooned” from the  estimates, never mind the original estimate of  million euro.“You’ve been too dismissive, so far, of people who have raised legitimate questions about this issue,” he said.“You’ve been too dismissive yesterday of the Eir submission. It deserves further analysis.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"parties asks mp standards watchdog to investigate fresh ian paisley holiday claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If she thinks there is grounds for an investigation, she will launch an investigation unless it is more appropriate for a dferent authority to investigate.If the commissioner does investigate, details of the investigation would only become public at the end of her work.Last December BBC Spotlight raised queries over who paid for a luxury holiday the DUP MP and his family took to the Coco Bodu Hithi resort in the nation in .Mr Paisley said then that he paid for part of the holiday and the rest was paid for by a friend.He did not reveal the identity of this friend, but added that the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work.On Tuesday night, a follow-up BBC Spotlight programme, Paisley In Paradise Revisited, reported that the friend was Dr Mohamed Shainee, who at the time of Mr Paisley’s trip to Coco Bodu Hithi was the Males Fisheries and Agriculture Minister.Dr Shainee told the programme he did not pay for the trip.However the programme reported that in a statement, Sunland Hotels which owns the resort, told them: “In , Mohamed Shainee requested Sunland Hotels co-owner Hussain Hilmy for a rate at one of the company’s resorts … Shainee settled the payment for Ian Paisley’s stay at the head office”."},{"url":null,"title":"bojonoshow the joke answers from jeremy hunts twitter qa session","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      Garda Commissioner Drew Harris says hard Brexit will need more border policeThe Republic#s top police officer says additional policing will be needed to patrol the border in the event of a hard Brexit.

Internal material referring to the role repeatedly refers to the importance of responding to the RHI Inquiry.The new communications post follows Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly’s decision to create a senior PR role which was filled by David Gordon, the former Executive spin doctor and editor of the Nolan Show, eight months after Stormont’s collapse.The News Letter asked DoFit had considered the implications of the creation of a cadre of powerful public relations figures in each department, especiallydevolution s and they are operating under rival ministers. It also asked about the inherent tension between appointing the same inidual to both oversee FoI requests and head up the department’s press office, which attempts to present a positive spin on whatever the department has done.Ian Paisley silent in face of new questions over more luxury foreign tripsVeteran civil rights campaigner Ivan Cooper passes away Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The department said that FoI had “not been amalgamated within the press office” and said it was “committed to open government and all FoI requests are handled in accordance with the legislation”.It added: “The reason for aligning open government and FoI is to help inform our openness agenda.”Officials working to create the new communications post moved with unusual alacrity, circumventing the normal cumbersome processes involved with such a situation because of the urgency and importance attached to the role by DoF permanent secretary Sue Gray.In an April  email to a colleague, civil service human resources officer Sonya Kilpatrick said of the urgency: “Sorry this is not ideal but you will understand that this is not normal process and we are all working outside of process to get it done quickly”. On another occasion, Ms Kilpatrick told the permanent secretary that “as you know there are certain formalities that we have to adhere [to] but we have cut these back as much as possible ... I appreciate the launch is one week later than you wanted but we have compressed the timetable as much as possible andall goes to plan you will have the result within six weeks”.The post will involve work “to create a closer sense of corporacy and unity across the department and the wider NICS”.try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
