This stretches the service at a time when staff want time with their friends and families.\u0027In the first two days on which collections were scheduled after Christmas (December 30-31), we have had 276 dropped roads reported by our depots. This was due to a number of factors, the extra waste, access issues and staffing.\u0027The performance immediately after Christmas is also despite the fact that crews previously working on the garden waste service have been kept on to strengthen the resources available for regular waste and recycling services at this peak time.\u0027We would like to reiterate our apologies to households that have been affected and be assured we are making every effort to catch up as soon as possible.\u0027If your bin is not collected within 48 hours of its scheduled collection, please take it back on to your property for collection on the next scheduled date for the type of bins in question.\u0027An alternative for those with access to a vehicle is to visit one of our five Household Recycling Centres – but please be aware that as during any festive period, they can be busy at peak times.\u0027  Have you been affected by rubbish delays?

Lorries and buses powered by hydrogen.For the past six years, hydrogen-powered buses have run in the capital between Aldwych and the Tower of London, as well as in Aberdeen and Brighton. They produce no emissions except water vapour and can travel 350-400 miles between refills. Even then, it takes only 3-5 minutes to refuel.Hydrogen does not occur naturally as a standalone fuel but can be made with green electricity.The drawback is that it is an explosive gas and cumbersome to store. But this year, Transport for London will introduce double-decker hydrogen-powered buses on three routes. By 2030, expect the smelly diesel-powered bus to be a thing of the past         For the past six years, hydrogen-powered buses have run in the capital between Aldwych and the Tower of London, as well as in Aberdeen and Brighton (stock image)3. Electricity storage systems that hold vast amounts of energy for days.The cost of wind and solar power has tumbled in recent years, but the Achilles heel of these two sources of electricity remains they are highly intermittent, and we don\u0027t have nearly enough electricity storage capacity to keep the lights on when the wind doesn\u0027t blow and the sun isn\u0027t shining.Over the next ten years this will have to be solved. It is possible that by 2030 we could have wind and solar farms operating in tandem with hydrogen plants that convert water to hydrogen and oxygen when wind and solar power is plentiful. The hydrogen could then be burned to produce heat or electricity when wind and solar power are scarce.4. Biodegradable plastic that\u0027s widely available.It is hard to eliminate plastic because in so many ways it is a miracle substance that plays a crucial role in all our lives.The problem is that plastic takes so long to break down chemically. Today\u0027s plastic bottle will still be a hazard for sea creatures in hundreds of years\u0027 time.Microplastics have become so ubiquitous in the environment that yesterday, using data from the Medical University of Vienna, the World Wide Fund for Nature revealed that each of us consumes the equivalent of two cereal bowls of microplastics a year.Biodegradable plastics are available for some purposes, such as single-use bags, but the technology can\u0027t yet be applied to plastic in every form. In ten years\u0027 time, though, don\u0027t be surprised if all plastics used in everyday life are biodegradable.         Biodegradable plastics are available for some purposes, such as single-use bags, but the technology can\u0027t yet be applied to plastic in every form (stock image)5. Technology for a carbon-free construction industry.Steel and cement are two of the great sticking points on the way to zero emissions. Between them, these industries are responsible for 8 per cent of global carbon emissions. It is not just a question of energy: carbon dioxide is unfortunately a by-product of the chemical reactions used to convert iron ore into steel and limestone into cement.Nor can we do without them: we will need huge quantities of steel and cement to build a renewable energy infrastructure. If we can produce cement and steel without CO2 as a by-product — a big if — we will be on to a winner.6. Homes that can be run on batteries.Photovoltaic solar panels on domestic homes took off a decade ago, thanks to generous feed-in tariff payments. But those subsidies have ended and now the only advantage comes from using the electricity yourself.The trouble is, you may not want to use much energy in the middle of a summer day when the panels are producing maximum power. The next step will be to combine solar panels with domestic batteries that lets you store the energy for later in the day, when you do need it.Several electricity companies, including EDF, Eon and Ovo, have started to sell packages that include solar panels and batteries — typically for about £7,000 — but over the next decade domestic battery systems will become more efficient and more commonplace.

Non-belching cows and other farm animals.Meat production is a problem in tackling climate change: according to the UN\u0027s Food and Agriculture Organisation, livestock production accounts for 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. A large part of the problem is methane emitted by belching cows. Last year, a team at the University of California claimed to have reduced methane emissions from cattle by 99 per cent by adding marine algae to their feed. Garlic also helps to reduce their methane production. In the next decade, we can expect to see the world\u0027s first methane-free cattle.8. Modular nuclear power stations that cut the cost of power.Nuclear is likely to be an essential part of our future energy mix but there are two big problems with it at present: the cost, and the economic cost of an accident. Hinkley C, the first new nuclear power station in Britain in a generation, is being built only because the Government promised its operators a guaranteed price for electricity that is twice current market rates.One potential solution is small modular reactors, which would be cheaper because their standard parts could be built in factories, and safer because each module would contain far lower quantities of radioactive material.Several designs are being tested and by the end of the decade we can expect the first commercial stations to be in operation.

If anyone can master it, it would be the discovery of the century.10. Hydrogen-powered planes that carry passengers.Aviation is another stumbling block on the path to zero emissions — there is, as yet, no viable alternative to jets for long journeys.But a California-based company, ZeroAvia, is developing a hydrogen-powered plane that it claims could compete in the market for small (10-20 seater) aircraft on journeys of up to 500 miles.Within ten years we can expect the first such planes to carry paying passengers, though whether the technology can be scaled up is another matter."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/02/01/22893456-7843891-image-m-17_1577927104257.jpg","title":"Britains worst mum Karen Matthews ENGAGED","story":"Share this articleEvil Karen Matthews shows off her ring after getting engaged to handyman boyfriend – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Cat stowaway taken 130 mile car journey Birmingham London","story":"Share this article When the bonnet was opened, he saw the traumatised tortoiseshell looking back at him. Locals living in the flats took the cat in following her Christmas Day ordeal until she could be collected by a cat rescue charity.Now the Celia Hammond Animal Trust is appealing for the owner to come forward. It said it suspected the ‘sweet’ and ‘very friendly’ female was a pet.          Locals living in the flats took the cat in after her Christmas Day ordeal until she could be collected by a cat rescue charity.

Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq\u0027s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.

The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.Iraq\u0027s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty.

The artist’s nine-metre bronze colossus will be unveiled in 2020, at the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour. Emin has been fascinated by Edvard Munch’s brokenhearted art all her life. Now her giant Mother will be a permanent feature of the fjord he so famously depicted under a blood red sky in The Scream.Yet this monumental image of a naked woman kneeling and hunched over an invisible child began as a small, fragile, handmade object. “It started off with me playing with clay,” says Emin, who didn’t think she had a chance when she entered the international competition to find a public artwork for Oslo’s Museum Island. Other candidates included the acclaimed Scandinavian artists Olafur Eliasson and Ragnar Kjartansson. But intimacy won.“I put in the little maquette and then watercolours of her on the island, and all the technical stuff. Apparently when they opened it up and took it out of the box, they fell in love with it. You can see that she’s old. My answer to that is, ‘Haven’t you ever loved someone who is old?’”Why turn this delicate creation into a nine-metre monument? Well, Emin has been experimenting with scale since 2016, when she made digitally printed enlargements of little figures she shaped in clay. When I saw the first results, in white plasticky material in her studio, the effect was startling – because her thumb and finger marks were enlarged too, perforating and scarring the statue. Before this she wasn’t much interested in big art. Her (rejected) proposal for Trafalgar Square’s fourth plinth was a family of little meerkats.So why go huge? “One reason is being close to Louise Bourgeois and seeing how she could go from small to giant. You can’t just make anything big – it was about finding the right form.”Now Mother is making the journey from maquette to 15 tonnes of bronze. “It’s being sand-cast in Stoke-on-Trent by the Westley Group,” says Emin. “They do submarines and stuff like that. It’s being made in 97 separate pieces, then they will be welded together in three sections and shipped to Oslo in giant cargo ships.”The original setting for the statue was “a sort of rocky terrain”. But Emin, a keen gardener and vegetable grower, has persuaded the funders to create a green environment instead. People won’t just be able to use the little park, she says: “They can go swimming from it as well. The Mother will welcome ships and protect everybody. She looks quite strong but also loving.”Emin had already been commissioned to show her art alongside Munch’s in the new museum’s opening exhibition in spring, which will tour to the Royal Academy in London. Her attempt to give Munch back the mother he lost is the culmination of a lifetime’s love affair with the artist who found new ways to symbolise emotion. His paintings are stains of loss, grief and isolation.“Munch’s my favourite artist in the whole world. He’s gentle, he’s emotional and he’s just a really, really fantastic painter.

Born a decade before reunification, Hardach grew up near Frankfurt in West Germany her book focuses on a family living on the other side of the border, in the GDR.Now settled in London, adult siblings Ella and Tobi Valentin seldom talk of their childhood in East Berlin. While both have vivid and disturbing memories of their family’s failed attempt to flee across the Hungarian border into Austria in 1987, they know very little of their mother’s subsequent imprisonment and nothing at all about the fate of their baby brother Heiko, who was taken away by the authorities and never seen again. When their mother dies, leaving behind some tantalising scraps of information, Ella returns to Berlin, hoping to find answers.In the Stasi archive, newly open to the public, she meets Aaron, an intern whose main task is the reconstruction of thousands of files shredded in the final days of communism, strip by painstaking strip. Despite his best efforts, Aaron can never be sure he has put the documents back together correctly vital pieces are often missing.Hardach builds up her narrative in the same way, starting from the edges and working in, the mystery revealing itself in fragments as she moves between Ella’s childhood memories and the complicated truths she begins to uncover. Through Ella’s investigation, one of many thousands being pursued through the archive, the novel peels back the contradictions that endure in a Berlin still coming to terms with reunification. It is a city where brutal prisons have reinvented themselves as museums and their interrogators as ordinary citizens, where the archivists filing documents about Stasi atrocities are themselves ex-Stasi, and decent people are determined to forget the things they did to survive. Confession With Blue Horses might have been another cold war thriller. Instead it is an absorbing slow burn of a book that not only casts light on Germany’s recent history but depicts, with careful tenderness, a family simultaneously torn apart by ideology and bound by powerful ties of love.• Confession With Blue Horses is published by Head of Zeus (£8.99).

It is fair to say that Ashley was not the only one who did not see that coming.In fact, JD Sports, along with eight of the decade’s other top 10 performers who ended 2019 in the FTSE 100, were not even in London’s blue chip index at the beginning of the decade.The flipside of Slater’s point can be seen by studying a separate list of the most valuable shares in the FTSE 100 at the beginning and end of the 2010s.Only two names have dropped out of the list: BG Group, which was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell in 2016, and Vodafone, which in 2014 sold its stake in its American subsidiary Verizon Wireless and then handed the £18bn idend back to shareholders.While Tesco’s bottom-of-the-table performance may have been partially self-inflicted, the company could also point to general sector issues, as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl increased their influence during the decade.Energy stocks also gave investors a miserable 10 years.

The filling is made with pieces of the fungi-based protein Quorn instead of beef, mixed with diced onions and meat-free gravy.Costing from £1.55, it will go on sale in 1,300 shops from Thursday before being rolled out to the remaining 700 outlets on 16 January.Greggs’ chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said: “Our vegan sausage roll launch was a huge success and we’ve been working tirelessly to expand our vegan-friendly offering and provide more delicious savoury food on-the-go options for people looking to reduce their meat intake.”Speculation about its successor has been mounting for months but has been rife for the last few days after a sign for a steak bake was spotted in a store and circulated on social media.The launch comes as retailers expand their vegan and plant-based offerings amid the growing popularity of flexitarian diets – where a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat.The Co-op chain is rolling out a new vegan range, called Gro, featuring 35 products, including alternatives to its steak bake, chilli con carne and sticky toffee pudding, that will be stocked in 2,000 stores and up to 4,000 independent retailers through its wholesale operation. The Co-op already offers almost 120 vegan wines but its entire beer and cider range will become vegan in 2020.This month Waitrose is doubling its vegan range, adding more than 30 new own-label and branded products, of which many are “first to market”. They include crisp-crumbed fishless goujons made from banana blossom – a flesh flower that hails from south-east Asia – and a pizza topped with vegan pepperoni.Meanwhile, diners at KFC will from Thursday be able to buy its new vegan burger – now a permanent item on its menu – after the success of an earlier trial. The fast-food chain’s usual “finger lickin’ good” chicken breast is replaced with a Quorn fillet coated in herbs and spices.More than 100,000 people have already pledged to stick to a plant-based diet for Veganuary, double the number who took part last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d631c5f63180cc5125d509da9414bedadb78683/28_31_4882_2928/master/4882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=852f00137808f2c49bf8c1cd29a6b7a4","title":"uk economy stagnation end 2019 survey shows","story":"British Chambers of Commerce report says long-term uncertainty is impeding growthThe UK economy ended 2019 in stagnation, under pressure from long-term uncertainty, mounting business costs and a global economic slowdown, according to a business survey.The British Chambers of Commerce’s (BCC) latest quarterly economic snapshot, based on a poll of 6,500 firms across the country in November, painted a gloomy picture of the economy at the end of the last decade.Cash flow, a key indicator of the health of businesses, improved slightly from its lowest level in eight years but remained very weak across the manufacturing and service industries.Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said: “The UK economy limped through the final quarter of 2019.“The fourth quarter was characterised by a broad-based slowdown in the dominant services sector with all key indicators weakening in the quarter, amid sluggish household expenditure and crippling cost pressures.“Despite some improvements, indicators in the manufacturing sector remain very weak by historic standards. A faltering service sector together with listless manufacturing activity points to a downbeat outturn for UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.”Turning to manufacturers, the measures for domestic and export sales improved slightly. However, order books were negative for the last two quarters.Adam Marshall, the BCC’s director general, called on the government to use its newfound majority to take big decisions to stimulate growth.“The end of political deadlock at Westminster must also bring action to renew business confidence and tackle the prolonged stagnation that’s affecting so much of the UK economy. If ministers take action to reduce upfront costs, move key infrastructure projects forward, and to help businesses on training, they’ll be rewarded with increased investment.“However, they also must move quickly over the coming weeks to ensure that Brexit is done right.

While relations between Washington and Beijing have improved (at least enough to solidify phase one of a US-China trade deal), China seems to be cooling on Britain. Reuters reports that China has temporarily blocked a planned cross-border listing between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges due to political tensions with the UK. They centre around Britain’s stance over the Hong Kong protests. Suspending the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme casts a shadow over the future of a project meant to build ties between Britain and China, help Chinese firms expand their investor base and give mainland investors access to UK-listed companies.The sources, who include public officials and people working on potential Shanghai-London deals, all said that politics was behind the suspension.Two of them highlighted Britain’s stance over the Hong Kong protests and one pointed to remarks over the detention of a now former staff member at its consulate in Hong Kong.A reminder that the M\u0026ampG property fund was suspended in early December following “unusually high and sustained outflows” – namely, investors demanding their money back – due to Brexit-related political uncertainty and the retail downturn that’s been hitting Britain’s high streets. It’s not clear which other properties are on the chopping block as M\u0026ampG tries to raise enough cash to re-open the fund. But my colleague Julia Kollewe rounded up the top holdings following the suspension last month:More on the continued suspension of M\u0026ampG’s £2.5bn UK property fund. The investment firm said the decision to keep the fund gated was taken “in the interest of protecting the fund’s investor,” and assured they were working hard to boost its cash position. Since the end of November the fund has sold around £70.4m worth of assets and M\u0026ampG said it is poised to raise another £67.2m. They’ve ended up having to sell the Ravenside Retail Park in Edmonton, which hosts retailers including Mothercare, Carpetright, Wickes, and Argos, for £51.4m.M\u0026ampG has also exchanged contracts on a property at 20 Kingston Road in Staines for £19m. The immediate priority is to raise cash levels in a controlled manner. The fund managers and associated teams are working hard to increase the fund’s cash position and since the end of November, they have exchanged or completed on £70.4m of assets and a further £67.2m is either under offer or in solicitors’ hands. Naturally, the fund is still being actively managed and M\u0026ampG is regularly communicating with clients, customers and other stakeholders. City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority been notified of the continued suspension. M\u0026ampG Investments has confirmed it will keep its UK property fund and feeder fund gated until further notice, meaning investor cash is still trapped. The firm is required to update investors every 28 days about the state of the fund. UK factory output has contracted at the fastest pace since July 2012. It has now been below the neutral mark of 50 for eight months straight. But given the poor factory reading from the Eurozone, some analysts are pointing out that the UK performed relatively better:Buckle up for more PMI data. The final reading for UK manufacturing PMI for December came in at 47.5. That is slightly higher than the flash estimate of 47.4 but below November’s reading of 49.1.It is also the second weakest level for nearly seven and a half years, having hit 47.4 in August this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit commenting on the latest eurozone PMI reading, says it will be a challenge to keep the eurozone economy out of recession in light of such a deep manufacturing contraction. Although firms grew somewhat more optimistic about the year ahead, a return to growth remains a long way off given that new order inflows continued to fall at one of the fastest rates seen over the past seven years. Firms sought to reduce inventory levels and cut headcounts as a result, focusing on slashing capacity and lowering costs. Such cost cutting was again also evident in further steep falls in demand for machinery, equipment and production-line inputs.Only households provided any source of improved demand in December, underscoring how the consumer sector has helped keep the economy out of recession in recent months. The ability of the wider economy to avoid sliding into a downturn in the face of such a steep manufacturing contraction remains a key challenge for the eurozone as we head into 2020.IHS Markit explained that both production and new orders continued to deteriorate in December, with output falling for an eleventh successive month and at a rate that matched September’s 81-month record. There was a broad-based softening of PMI figures during December, with seven of the eight countries covered by the survey recording weaker PMI numbers compared to November (the exception being Austria, which registered an unmoved reading). Germany was again the weakest-performing country, whilst the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in over six-and-a-half years. Conversely, growth was sustained to a solid degree in Greece, whilst a marginal gain was seen in France. Manufacturing PMI data for the 19 Eurozone economies is in and the figures are not pretty. IHS Markit’s Final manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index came in at 46.3 in December. That is higher than flash estimates of 45.9 but is still below November’s reading of 46.9. It means manufacturing PMI has now been contracting for 11 straight months, having been below the 50 mark - which is the baseline for sector expansion – since February. Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are expected in less than five minutes time, but there are poor readings already coming out of inidual countries including France, Germany and Italy. Howard Archer, economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club has details on the data:The pound’s decline is helping prop up the UK’s blue chip stocks this morning, as foreign earnings are worth more to multinational UK firms when sterling is weaker. The UK currency is suffering as we edge closer to Brexit, set for the end of January. Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, says:  The pound will be hoping for a better than forecast UK manufacturing PMI to act as a bit of reassurance.European stocks have jumped at the start of their first trading day of 2020:Excitement about the US-China trade could be short-lived, with the devil likely to be the details of the Phase Two agreement. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: President Trump said that phase one of the trade deal will be signed on 15 January, and even though a lot of the good news has already been factored in, it should assist with the bullish mood. Once the phase one hurdle has been cleared, traders will start to think about phase two. The second-leg of the trade deal will address trickier topics like intellectual property rights. Seeing as the first stage of the trade dispute dragged on for approximately 18 months, the next leg could last even longer – seeing as it is likely to be much complex. Mr Trump needs to show that he is standing up for American interests, but Beijing can play the long game, so the Chinese government have no incentive to meet all his demands. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Chinese stocks have led the charge in Asia, helped by news that the central bank will cut lenders’ reserve ratio requirement, freeing up around 800bn yuan (£87bn) in new funds for loans. It’s hoped that the extra liquidity will prevent growth slowing in 2020. The ratio requirement cut helped offset disappointment from the China’s Caixin manufacturing PMI, which came in at 51.5 overnight. While it held above 50, the baseline for expansion, it was below economist expectations for 51.8. Reaction to the PMI data may have been worse were it not for the Phase One trade deal having been secured between the US and China. The deal will be signed by Washington and Beijing officials 15 January, but once that hurdle is cleared, jitters about Phase Two could revive uncertainty fears for markets. Commenting on the PMI data, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said: The index was well above its uptrend, so a decline is not surprising. Without the Phase One trade deal it would have been worse. We are reticent to read too much into the details, but the loss of momentum in new orders is disappointing, chiming with the official report. Export orders appear to have been aided by the deal prospects, falling by less than the overall orders gauge, though the subindex remained only slightly above 50.We are also waiting for final manufacturing PMI readings for December, covering the eurozone and UK economies. Stay tuned!

The party needs to take time for judgments to settle about its descent into the electoral abyssNearly a month ago Jeremy Corbyn announced he would step down after a period of reflection. This week he offered the first fruits of that process: 2019, Corbyn announced, had been “quite the year for our country and our labour movement”. Nevertheless, he added: “We have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson.”It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019. It needs to have a strategy for power. In the real world, power is hope, not the other way round.This is extremely likely to occur if Labour continues to put the cart before the horse. The leadership election is under way. But the period of reflection has barely started. It needs more time and structure. The costs were obvious this week, when the apparent frontrunner published a manifesto of vacuous generality, which posed no difficult questions and lacked substantive proposals for doing anything differently. On the basis of that article, if Rebecca Long Bailey is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question.If it is to be useful, Labour’s period of reflection needs some ground rules it currently lacks. These include: a recognition of the gravity of the situation, an obligation to answer difficult questions, a dispassionate study of the facts, an open-minded approach, a willingness to admit mistakes, the avoidance of slogans, and the willingness to listen to others – who should include Labour’s opponents and (increasingly the same thing) the voters. There is not much sign of any of that yet.The right questions need to be rooted in a balanced and honest appraisal of Labour’s electoral position. And the answers must avoid the habit, which affects all sides in the party, of evading difficult truths by talking about something else. So here are some of the important questions, and my own brief and provisional answers:Was Brexit the main problem? It was one of them, but Labour’s Brexit problem was its longstanding ambiguity, not its pro-European approach. Labour still needs a European policy for the post-Brexit 2020s.So was it Corbyn? The surveys say yes. His ratings were the worst ever for a Labour leader. But the Corbyn programme was not believed either. Competence matters, and Labour had not put in the hard yards on that. Corbyn would have claimed the credit for a win, so he must accept the blame for the defeat.Did Labour win the argument? No, it did not. Some aspects of Labour’s campaign cut through, but not by enough. The election result tells the story: Labour lost. To say otherwise is to be in denial. Too many still are.Was it the media’s fault? No … but. Britain’s media is politically biased and not as good as it thinks it is. It made mistakes in 2019, some of which would have been difficult to avoid. But these get exaggerated. The answer is not a more politicised media but better standards.Would a return to New Labour be the answer? Of course not – 2024 will not be 1994. New Labour must own its failures, just as the Corbynistas must own theirs. But if Labour cannot reconcile its militants and its moderates, it will pay the price. It needs to try.Should Labour be a socialist party? A big question for some, but not the main one for most. It depends what you mean by socialism. Labour ignores aspiration and the desire to do well at its peril. Inidualism and community are not incompatible. It also depends on how much it matters to you to win elections.Is it all over for Labour? No. See above. But Labour has been on a losing streak for a decade. It is now steered by a clique that have run it close to catastrophe, and who should get the boot. After 1992, many asked if Labour could ever win again. It turned out that it could. But this time things could get worse before they get better, and Labour may not win an election for a decade.Should Labour split into a left party and a centre-left party? Not if it hopes to win power in the next 20 years. The traditions need to recognise that each is legitimate.Finally, stop obsessing about the left. Most people are not interested. Think instead about problems, programmes and priorities. And we members of the Amalgamated Union of Commentators, Columnists and Allied Pundits should stop talking about Labour as “us”. Those days are gone. We must watch what happens next and allow judgments time to settle. Millions of people who want a better government and a different kind of society don’t see Labour as the answer, let alone as all-knowing and all-virtuous, for the simple reason that right now it is neither."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329bc72de9affe5f424a555eb8b7037c04a4d245/0_50_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ee511dd9fa31b776d002a7e00425c9","title":"heres why the uk wants to strengthen its relationship with new zealand maori","story":"The UK and Māori of Aotearoa New Zealand are looking to the past to build stronger relationships for the futureThe connections between the UK and New Zealand are such that we feel instantly at home in each other’s countries, sipping a flat white or an English Breakfast tea. We have a similar sense of humour, a similar sense of adventure, similar tastes. There is so much that feels familiar. But perhaps the greatest joy of my first two years as British high commissioner to New Zealand has been getting to know that which is less familiar: learning about and building connections with te ao Māori whānui – the wider Māori community.In my time here in Aotearoa New Zealand, I have been welcomed onto marae meeting houses from Bluff to Waitangi, and attended the annual coronation of the Māori king. I have learnt to speak (some!) Māori. I have – with my team – learnt tikanga Māori (customary practices), as well as our shared and sometimes painful history. I have built friendships. And I have delighted in seeing my children absorb Māori culture: doing their introductory pepehā, throwing themselves into kapahaka dance, and fully at ease at a haka pōwhiri (welcome ceremony), greeting by hongi after hongi after hongi.When I expressed regret, on behalf of the British government, for the killing of nine Māori by Captain Cook’s crew 250 years ago, it was met with a wide range of responses. The response that mattered most was that of the local Tūranga iwi and hapū, the descendants of those killed, who responded with tears, warmth and friendship. I also received a large number of positive messages from across New Zealand society.But for some the expression of regret didn’t go far enough in addressing the wrongs of the past. And some at the other end of the spectrum felt that I was interfering in New Zealand’s affairs – with one person even calling for me to leave the country. (As of the time of writing, no transport has been provided, so I am still here.)But the focus on me as an inidual missed the fact that the expression of regret was part of a wider UK approach. And while I am deeply invested, personally, in this agenda, it is not just me as high commissioner, it is the UK writ-large – government, people, business, cultural institutions – who want the closest possible relationship with Aotearoa New Zealand. That means with both Pākeha and Māori, with the Crown and with all the Iwi of Aotearoa. And that is a commitment that will extend way beyond my tenure here in New Zealand.Our work to address the past is part of the UK’s broader efforts to build a real and enduring partnership with Māori, and strengthen our business, cultural and people-to-people links. We have established a formal relationship with the Federation of Māori Authorities, co-hosted an Auckland Māori Business Networking event with Ernst and Young Tahi, and are mapping out what more we can do, now and in the future, to increase trade connections between the UK and Māori.There is a lot going on in the cultural and research space, too. In Gisborne, I went to the opening of Tū te Whaihanga, an exhibition of taonga (cultural treasures) that left the region 250 years ago, and are now back on loan from museums in the UK and Germany. And in November we took a delegation to the UK for He Whai Mātauranga (In Pursuit of Knowledge), a programme designed to enable greater access for Māori to taonga held in the UK, by building stronger relationships between iwi and UK cultural institutions. We also launched a UK scholarship programme, supporting three post-grad Māori museum studies students to do research in the UK in 2020, and hope that these connections, and this sharing of knowledge, will lead to even greater collaborations between the UK and Aotearoa New Zealand.Whatever we may think of those first encounters 250 years ago, the ties that are left are strong: between the UK and Aotearoa New Zealand, and between the UK and Māori. We cannot change the past, but we can learn from it and, equipped with that knowledge, begin to chart a way forward. I am under no illusions as to how much we have to do: we are at the start of this journey. But what I hope is clear is the genuine intent of the UK, its government and people, to build an enduring partnership with iwi and hāpu Māori, and with all the people of Aotearoa.

I recommend it highlyAs the decade of the 2010s began, I was ensconced in an exciting if modestly paid New York media job, writing every week about the recession-fueled layoffs and closures across the media world, while avoiding them personally. As the decade reached its end, I myself became a casualty of a publication closure and layoff, just another unemployed writer hustling for what comes next. In journalism, as in life, there are only lucky idiots and unlucky idiots. Successful people who are very convinced that they deserve everything they have are not to be trusted.In 2009, I was working at Gawker, a news and gossip site that rested in the sweet spot between the media establishment and the seething hordes – enough of an outsider to do whatever we pleased, but well known enough that the insiders still read us, often out of hate. It was fun. I was a media reporter, and watched wide-eyed as titans of the industry were ravaged by a combination of the global economic crisis and the rise of new media, like us.As the years went by, what had begun as a little blog by a handful of people working at home moved to a big office in Soho, with parties on a private roof deck, and then to a fancier office in Union Square, with wide open spaces that were the architectural equivalent of bragging. The mid-decade years were the high point one liquor-soaked holiday bash featured a tower of crab legs and a bowl of macarons the size of a car trunk famous media people routinely showed up at our parties, eager to slum with the mouthy kids who made fun of them, and to try to be friendly enough to inoculate themselves from criticism in the future. One day Brian Williams, the news anchor, came by the office for a chummy lunch with us, motivated, no doubt, by the fact that his daughter was about to star in Girls, an HBO show we were sure to mock mercilessly. We were loved, hated, and feared in equal measure. We were proud of the quality of our enemies. More importantly, we were financially sustainable and doing what we wanted.Then it all fell apart. A lawsuit secretly funded by a vindictive Republican billionaire outraged about our reporting on him bankrupted the company. Layoffs became common, and employees started to flee – one’s entire social life could have been built around going-away parties. The company was sold off to a big media company, which handled it ineptly, and after a couple of years sold off again to a private equity firm, often the last stop before the media ownership train goes fully off the tracks. In October, Splinter, the politics-focused successor to Gawker where I was working, was folded. If nothing else, it was a well-timed invitation for introspection on a decade in journalism. That and a box of old notepads are all you can walk away with.The point of journalism is the stories. Everything else is glitter. Furthermore, the vast majority of everything you write will be forgotten within a matter of days. The sooner a writer understands this, the better. We are all secretly precious, harboring hopes that our wise words will be pored over by future generations. But in reality, written journalism has a lot in common with television journalism: it will be enjoyed or despised when it comes out, and then everyone will move on. There will be a handful of stories you write that will be remembered for years, but you have no control over which these will be. They are just as likely to be your worst as your best. Any writer unable to reach a sort of zen acceptance of these facts will have their heart broken by reality soon enough.The people who really will remember what you write are the people you write about. The gift of journalism is the chance to tell the stories of those who would otherwise not be heard, and journalism tends to be worthwhile in direct proportion to how much this is its goal. In general, people are happy to have someone interested in them enough to tell their stories the only segments of society who try to avoid being written about are those who feel that the media might threaten their tight hold on power. If you are a reporter and you find yourself talking to evasive PR people more than regular people, you are probably writing about the wrong things. This is always a hazard. Prestige in media is bestowed on absurd things. The most prestigious job, White House correspondent, is also the worst. At best, it offers the hope of schmoozing with bureaucratic leeches for bits of gossip that can be spun into news more often, it involves looking good at televised press conferences while being lied to by officials.Likewise, the media attention lavished on presidential conventions is matched by an absolute lack of news. I covered three of them, and never heard a single newsworthy thing at any of them that did not come out of the mouth of a protester who was barred from actually accessing the convention by many well-armed police. America would be better off setting up a single live camera on the convention stage, and then sending the thousands of political reporters out to talk to homeless people instead. That would offer at least the hope of capturing some insight about what is happening in the country.There exists in journalism a discernible ide between those who see it as a cause, and those who see it as a career that might enable them to hang out with important people and get a hefty book deal one day. Some journalists will tell you what they want to write about, and others will tell you where they want to work. It is the latter, unfortunately, who get most of the jobs. The most esteemed positions in media are often held by people whose greatest talent is “getting good jobs”. The world is full of excellent writers and reporters who are barely getting by, because they make the mistake of pouring their efforts into stories rather than into career-building. A less self-pitying way to say this is: there are scores of people capable of filling every decent job in journalism. The New York Times could turn over its entire staff 20 times without suffering a loss in quality. This means, in fairness, that we should hold the work of the people at the top of the profession to high standards, because there are a hundred writers standing behind them who could do their jobs just as well. Everyone who has been around for a while has come to understand this. It is what drives the white-hot anger at every half-assed Ivy Leaguer who lands a plum columnist job.The rage of the creative underclass burns brightly just below the surface of the media. That is why the most meaningful legacy that Gawker left behind may not be any of its big scoops, but rather its role in setting off the wave of unionization that is still sweeping through America’s newsrooms to this day. Unions took off in media because journalists have, if nothing else, enough common sense to see that the people in charge make more money and have more power but are clearly not any smarter than us. That can’t last forever.Yes, journalism has flaws. Its highest level is full of self-important twits and lazy white men failing upwards it is dour, sensationalistic, and ignorant of vast swaths of the country it routinely publishes falsehoods, exaggerations, errors, and lies, due in large part to an unearned conviction that it is competent in many matters that are in fact wholly beyond its capabilities and it is fascinated with nothing more than itself, forcing countless uninterested readers to slog through navel-gazing tripe such as this essay.The average sanitation worker contributes far more to the public good in a single day than most journalists do in a lifetime. If you choose to pursue it as a career, you are in for infinite disappointments. You wanted to cover Watergate, but you will end up writing reviews of Waterpiks your dream job will instead be awarded to some halfwit celebrity’s kid if you ever do secure a worthwhile position, you will surely lose it the good times won’t last, but the bad times very well might. Your best stories will be forgotten, you won’t make much money, and your archives will be lost to tech glitches. When it’s all over, your entire body of work will have mattered to only a small handful of people, none of whom you will ever meet.Which is all to say: I recommend it highly. If you ever get a chance to be a journalist, grab it and hold on tight. It is much, much better than having a real job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e354380f3dd979f81cc1a152e7706f3cfb557219/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a749c23b4dee709db0c4cd94bb32fa91","title":"nature rewild eco anxiety seas climate emergency environment","story":"We can keep our eco-anxiety at bay by working to rewild our seas and restore our environmentIt’s going to be a rough year. The fatal combination of escalating climate breakdown and the capture of crucial governments by killer clowns provokes a horrible sense of inevitability. Just when we need determined action, we know that our governments, and the powerful people to whom they respond, will do everything they can to stymie it.Witness the disasters in Australia. In mid-December, on the day the nation’s lethal heatwave struck, Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper the Australian filled its front page with a report celebrating new coal exports and a smear story about the chiefs of the state fire services, who were demanding an immediate end to the burning of fossil fuels. The response of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to the escalating catastrophe was to embark on a holiday overseas as his country burned.Some of the Earth’s largest land masses – Australia, Russia, the US, Brazil, China, India and Saudi Arabia – are governed by people who seem to care little for either humankind or the rest of the living world. To maintain their grip on power, which means appeasing key oligarchs and industries, they appear prepared to sacrifice anything – including, perhaps, the survival of humanity.I know that the protesters who made 2019 the year of climate action will continue to step up. We will do all we can to focus the world’s attention on the greatest crisis human beings have ever faced. But with hostile governments blocking a collective international response to this emergency, the struggle will feel increasingly desperate.I admit that I’m feeling quite close to burnout. I believe resilience is the most useful human quality, and I’ve sought to cultivate it, but in 2019 I felt my resolve begin to weaken at times as it has never done before. Part of the reason is doubtless my continuing health issues: the repeated complications and procedures that have followed my cancer treatment two years ago. Sometimes it’s hard to disentangle the external and internal sources of despondency.For many people, there is no such separation. We now know that people living in heavily polluted places have higher levels of depression and suicide: air pollution has been implicated in brain inflammation and damage to nerve cells, both of which have been linked to mental illness. Research has also linked wellbeing with environmental quality: a recent study in Denmark suggests that people who grew up in places with plenty of green space have a lower chance of developing a psychiatric disorder than those who were surrounded only by artificial surfaces, even when all other factors have been taken into account.I have tried to keep my eco-anxiety at bay, to box it into my working life. But every month this becomes more difficult. The rising sense of panic I feel is entirely rational we should all be feeling it. But we can’t live with it through every hour of every day.So my new year’s resolution is to spend more time on my sea kayak. It possesses almost miraculous properties: it is a four-metre, plastic rejuvenation machine. After a day on the water, ideally paddling as far as I can, sometimes until the coast is out of sight, I feel ready for anything.But even across this experience a shadow now falls: my gathering awareness of what I should be seeing at sea, and its resounding absence. The shocking and distressing fact is that the waters around the UK were once among the most abundant on Earth, and are now among the least. Armadas of bluefin tuna once stormed our coasts, harrying shoals of mackerel and herring many miles long. Halibut the size of barn doors and turbot like tabletops came into shallow water to feed. Cod commonly reached almost two metres haddock grew to a metre. Plaice were the size of road atlases. Pods of fin whales and sperm whales could be seen from the shore, while Atlantic grey whales, now extinct, roamed our estuaries. Gigantic sturgeon poured up the rivers to spawn, pushing through traffic jams of salmon, sea trout, lampreys and shad. On some parts of the seabed the eggs of the herring lay six-feet deep.Much of the sea floor was covered by a continuous crust of life: reefs of oysters and mussels, soft corals and sea pens, sea fans and sponges, peacock worms and anemones, stabilising the sediments and filtering the water column, with the result that our seas might have been crystal clear. The abundance of everything, if we were to transport ourselves back a few hundred years, would blow our minds.Now, on some days, it’s a surprise to see anything. I might, if I’m lucky, spot a flock of shearwaters, skimming the waves with their velvety wings, a couple of gannets, a solitary razorbill, the occasional small bait ball. When I kayak in Cardigan Bay, in Wales, what I hope to find above all else is dolphins. Sometimes I do, and these days are the waymarks of my life. But my sightings seem to have become less common since scallop dredgers were allowed back into even the most “strictly protected” parts of the bay by the Welsh government, ripping up the seabed and destroying most of the life it harbours.It’s all so stupid. Commercial fishing is by far the greatest cause of ecological destruction at sea, but produces less income and employment in the UK than the industries it wrecks. Recreational angling alone, which is perpetually threatened by the absence of fish, generates more jobs and money than commercial fishing. Whale and dolphin watching, ing and snorkelling would, if allowed to prosper, greatly enhance the livelihoods of coastal people. And this is to say nothing of the immeasurable improvements in the lives of everyone connected to a thriving, abundant living system.If we stop dragging trawls and dredges through it, the life of the seas would recover with astonishing speed. Because most marine animals are highly mobile during at least one stage of their development, the rewilding of the seas needs little help from humans. But we could make a few useful interventions, such as the possibly crazy but wonderful idea once proposed by two researchers at the University of Central Lancashire of transporting Pacific grey whales to the Atlantic and the less crazy but equally wonderful idea of reintroducing the Dalmatian pelican – a species that was native to the UK until the middle ages. Both species play a crucial role in marine food webs, and can fill our lives with wonder.Recharging nature recharges the human spirit. In 2020, we could all do with some of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c934763aaff571142631a24fb9b40712ac6a5d/161_812_1711_1026/master/1711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53379f92bdc14560d8baa202d29bdf76","title":"best ethical sportswear in pictures","story":"Whatever your workout, here is the best sustainable kit to get you in that ‘new year, new you’ feeling"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a8a809109f6dc380a5f9e70a081a76c8ed0262/360_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094bf47125ccd021e9bfb805a7a8694e","title":"in the line of duty review aaron eckhart","story":"Troubled detective Aaron Eckhart is forced to team up with a young citizen journalist in this run-of-the-mill action spectacleThere’s a straight-to-video feel to this cop thriller, directed by action veteran Steven C Miller, written by Jeremy Drysdale (who scripted the indie hit Grand Theft Parsons) and starring its exec producer, Aaron Eckhart.He plays Detective Frank Penny, a troubled but decent police officer with a reputation for shooting first and asking questions later.

Here is We Are from Jazz, or We Are Jazzmen, the zany jazz comedy musical from Russian director Karen Shakhnazarov, originally released in 1983, but now revived as part of the Melodia! festival of Russian musicals at London’s BFI Southbank and Ciné Lumière.Shakhnazarov is now a rather establishment figure in Putin’s Russia as director general of the official Mosfilm studios and supporter of the party line, but his breakthrough film showed him to be a sprightly, subversive, comic talent – a tweaker of authority’s nose. His story imagines the birth of jazz in the Soviet Union, and it has the spirit of Hollywood movies such as George Roy Hill’s The Sting or even Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot.Igor Skylar is Kostya, a brilliant young jazz pianist expelled from the music academy because jazz is emblematic of decadent American capitalism. Kostya tries valiantly to argue for the progressive, revolutionary credentials of jazz – the music of the African-American people, fighting against their white oppressor. But it is no good. So Kostya wanders the streets, recruiting street musicians for his band, and finds Stepan (Aleksandr Pankratov-Chyorny), Zhora (Nikolai Averyushkin), and Ivan (Pyotr Shcherbakov).Another kind of jazz musical might have concentrated on the picaresque adventures of our heroes, perhaps particularly their adventures in love and it’s true that a beautiful singer called Katya (Yelena Tsyplakova) tries to tempt Kostya away from his pals to form a band with her. But this is more of an absurdist, bizarre, even existential jazz musical. The guys (they’re never that fussed about deciding on a name) keep worrying about jazz. What is jazz? What are they doing playing it? When will people understand and like jazz? With a sickeningly ironic inevitability, the Soviet authorities, having disliked jazz, are forming committees in which they will decide what kind of jazz is sufficiently pure. And there are uproarious, dreamlike scenes in which they get to play lavish concerts on expensive sets: one including a giant rotating LP disc.Kostya himself sounds like a mature Oscar Peterson.

We’ve been expecting you. On a chilly, boisterous night in north London, Arsenal’s £72m record signing produced a fine attacking performance that was startling in more ways than one.Startling first of all because Pépé was able to unpick the left side of Manchester United’s defence with such ease that the heavy-legged, heavy-footed, and indeed heavy Luke Shaw looked genuinely lost at times, a single stone Easter Island head planted in the sand, watching on in sombre silence as a game of football took place around him.And startling also because it was Nicolas Pépé and this has not been Pépé’s story at Arsenal, at least not before now.Arsenal were aggressive in midfield and coherent in their attacking plans. Mesut Özil ran the game as a genuine No 10. Toward the end he took a dropping ball just outside his own area with such a beautifully soft, cushioned touch that his left boot seemed to cradle and cosset the ball, like a man tickling a cat beneath the chin.And again Arsenal’s attacking plan was startling for other reasons too. Mainly, it was startling because Arsenal actually had an attacking plan and this has not been the story of this team, at least not before now.The ballad of Nicolas Pépé has made for a curious tale so far. At times he has been vague, peripheral, hard to define, and hostage to the idiot-wind of online Arsenal rage. But really, whose fault is this? To what degree can one high-priced inside-forward be expected to fix this huge, listing entity, the mixed and flowing substance that is Arsenal? Or even to step outside the general flow of Arsenal-ism, a condition that has been defined by vagueness, entropy, drift.It is these qualities that Arteta has set his face against in his early days. “We are asking the players to do something different,” he wrote before the game, “to play at a different pace, much more aggressive than they’ve been used to.”More aggressive, more physical. This is, it should be said, a low bar. But there has been a notable cranking of the throttle. And to his credit Arteta went with the full gun here, starting Pépé alongside Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang.Arsenal’s manager makes for a compelling figure on the touchline. He looks like a man entirely possessed by the task. He looks like he lives every pass. He looks like a handsome tailor’s mannequin haunted by the spirit of a Victorian wraith.But Arteta is nothing if not furiously thorough in his preparation. Here he seemed to have grasped before anyone else that Pépé should, given a clear run, have the beating of Shaw every time.And so it came to pass. There were some early splutters. Three times in the opening five minutes United had one of those cavalry charge attacks at the Arsenal back four, bearing down on that strangely vacant space where usually some footballers stand.After which Arsenal began to impose their own patterns. Pépé opened the scoring with a slightly strange goal. Aubameyang twirled out to the right and laid the ball inside for Sead Kolasinac. His cross took a flick off Victor Lindelöf’s heel. Pépé scuffed it back across goal, but with enough meat on the shot to defeat David de Gea’s e.Steadily Pépé seemed to realise that Shaw just wasn’t able to follow his movements. Pépé glided inside. Shaw flinched. Pépé produced a regal stop and turn that left his man scrambling on the turf in a jumble of limbs. He looked in those moments like what he is, a high-end footballer with the kind of poise and snap that seems to make the day stand still just a little when he has the ball.It could have been more. Towards half time Pépé took a poor clearance from De Gea and had time to wait, take a breath, consider the fleeting nature of youth, power, beauty, talent, then curl a shot on to the foot of the post. It could have been more also because Pépé didn’t quite do to Shaw what he might have done, an opponent who was reduced at times in the face of Özil, Pépé and Ainsley Maitland-Niles to the status of a training aid, a defensive hurdle rigged up out of three sacks of grain and a pumpkin for a head.“Rinse him!” one Arsenal fan kept shouting. But Pépé didn’t quite rinse Shaw, or didn’t quite rinse him enough to kill the game completely. Pépé has balance, touch, pace. He just lacked a bit of viciousness here. Perhaps it will come.He left the pitch shortly after the hour mark having attempted 26 passes and made all 26 of them, completed more dribbles than anyone else and won as many headers as any Arsenal defender. It felt, as all new eras should, like a start had been made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e076bef64b145cf69cd86f531521c8810ddfb5e/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d86b9681a9180fcc4da63b0b95175f","title":"womens football decade of progress 2020","story":"There is real optimism in the game but while attitudes generally have changed dramatically not everyone is on the same pageWomen’s football has come a very long way in a decade. Ten years ago there existed an indifference towards the few women who chose to persevere in what many viewed a novel and headstrong manner to play the men’s game – because, let’s face it, that is what “the people’s game” actually meant. Now, Chelsea’s Fran Kirby can post photos on social media of her dog sitting in front of a Bentley. It may be a loaned Bentley (the gap hasn’t closed that much) but the England forward does have numerous sponsorship deals, with Nike and Swarovski among others.If the Noughties was the decade in which players such as Alex Scott edged from washing the shirts and shorts of the Arsenal men’s team towards the possibility of scraping a living from football, then this last decade has been the one that has provided respect and with it professionalism, sponsorship, support and the chance to make a modest living out of the game.Delayed by a year because of the economic downturn, the Women’s Super League was launched in 2011 with eight teams and not without controversy as 16 teams applied for places. By 2014 it was expanded to include a second tier of 10 teams, with Doncaster Belles relegated to make way for the revamped Manchester City.In 2017 the Football Association switched the leagues from a summer to a winter schedule to match the men’s calendar, while launching its four-year Gameplan for Growth strategy. By the launch of the 2018-19 season, a full-time professional top tier and semi-professional second ision was in place. The changes have been rapid. And they have been forced. The casualties, and there have been many, have been necessary according to the FA’s head of women’s football, Sue Campbell.“Yes it’s tough on them but, unfortunately, whenever you create these kind of step changes there are casualties,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live in May 2018. “Others have stepped up to the mark. It has to be a commitment from the club to step up and move forward together with us.”There is an element of truth to that. It could be argued players and staff of teams such as Sunderland and Watford were let down by the lack of ambition and commitment of their clubs as much as the FA. On the other hand Donny Belles, Yeovil, and others who have been long-time investors in the women’s game but were unable to compete with the increased financial demands of the FA, have been sacrificed.In the meantime, amid all that upheaval, attendances have stagnated. From an average of 728 in 2014 they climbed to 1,128 by 2016 but then dipped as the winter switch took its toll, eventually averaging 996 for the first fully professional season.By mid-November domestic WSL attendances, boosted by big games, were averaging 4,112 (and 1,425 with the showpiece games at Stamford Bridge, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and elsewhere removed from the equation). The close to £20m investment by Barclays in the top ision and grassroots football was the pinnacle of a host of sponsorship deals for clubs, the national team and players.There is a real optimism in women’s football. The media, the FA, commercial partners, clubs and fans are, broadly speaking, on the same page. There is an ideological belief in the importance of building the game, perhaps a result of the way attitudes have changed around women, women’s bodies and women’s rights more widely, but that is coupled with a much cruder realisation that there are real longer‑term financial and image benefits to backing the women’s game.Not everything is rosy. The gap between the haves of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United and the have-nots is growing. Lyon face a similar scenario in France, where their investment is almost punished by teams unwilling to play catch-up.And, while attitudes generally have changed dramatically, there is still a long way to go – within organisations but also more generally in society. The first comment on Twitter in response to Megan Rapinoe being named the 2019  Footballer of the Year was: “Sure, I agree. Still not watching women’s football though.” Another said: “Lol. Hypocrite look in the mirror and start with yourself. You obnoxious P.O.S.”Almost every comment on Facebook was negative. There is a vocal minority who are not content to just ignore what they don’t like but feel compelled for some unknown reason to shout it. They find their fuel in the bodies that perpetuate the inequity – the clubs that forced Spanish footballers to strike, Fifa’s decision to let a $370m gap in World Cup prize money grow by $10m despite a doubling of the women’s fund to $60m, US Soccer’s equal-pay dispute with their most successful ever senior team.There is still so much to do. Women’s football should be swimming with the tide but, unfortunately, there is still much for which to be fought. Here’s hoping this decade sees that change.• Liverpool have signed Reading midfielder Rachel Furness after she was recalled from her loan at Tottenham. The Northern Ireland international will provide a big boost to Vicky Jepson’s squad which is still looking for a first win 10 games in despite some strong performances.• Arsenal’s Swiss midfielder Lia Wälti has signed a new long-term contract with the WSL champions. The 26-year-old played a key role in the Gunners’ first title in seven years and her absence was felt when she suffered a knee injury that required surgery last April.• West Ham have recruited England Under-20 captain Grace Fisk following her graduation from the University of South Carolina. The defender won bronze with England at the U20 Women’s World Cup in 2018 and she picked up SEC defensive player of the year that same year and MVP in 2019 as a mainstay of the Gamecocks’ defence.• Everton have re-signed England midfielder Izzy Christiansen from Lyon.

Here’s how to get in the habitMuch like going for a run or eating your greens, saving your cash offers long-term benefits, but is not always appealing. And, let’s face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away – confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you don’t have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up.Don’t worry if you have been putting it off for years – you can’t be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, “saving is only possible with motivation”.If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: “Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it’s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.”Don’t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off – you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.If you don’t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest £1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend £1.45, you will be debited £2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct’s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically.As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts.If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as £1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile – £25 a month is more typical and meaningful.“If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,” says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. “This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.”A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06dabb5757bd783ae8707a3ee95005f4fd73fe9b/0_485_1949_1169/master/1949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb88fd783453407e204a2a73dfbd1c","title":"how to have more fun in 2020","story":"This is the year to start taking happiness seriously. But how – and where do you find the time? Here are the tips and advice you need for a pleasure-filled yearThe last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, ide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are the idea is to shift your mindset.Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253a53ff66775895f9923f559f90660161e8103b/69_0_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30d3945f29c9e2c827e504128b7d21f","title":"surprising psychology behind being perpetually late","story":"There are as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually tardy people – and the underlying reasons can be complexSometimes, one of my psychotherapy clients will be late. “The tube got stuck I do apologise.” If it happens once, I don’t treat it as significant. But some clients are perpetually late – perhaps just five or 10 minutes, but always – and out of breath when they get to the door. Then I am curious about what is behind their pattern of lateness, what it means and what purpose it serves.There are probably as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually late people. Sometimes it seems unfathomable, but not always. One client remembered that his mother always spent so long in the bathroom that she made him late for school. She told him that it didn’t matter, and early people are uptight anyway. In his unconscious, being on time for things had got mixed up with being disloyal to his mother and therefore bad. Once he had found this narrative, he lost his compulsion for lateness.Punctual people may believe that late people are passive-aggressive and that their time is more valuable than those who wait for them. But reasons for lateness are generally more complex. The reason may be the opposite of arrogance. It could be that they don’t value themselves enough. If this is the case, might they be unable to see how others could possibly mind their non-appearance?This explanation may work for social situations, but why miss planes, boats and trains? Perhaps it is an unconscious testing of the theory: “If I were a worthy person, the train would wait for me.” Since it doesn’t, the feeling of not mattering is reinforced.One client I had kept thwarting her own attempts to succeed in her career, and bad time-keeping was part of this. When we unpicked what success would mean to her, she uncovered an old family belief that people with money were evil, bad people. Faced with a choice of not progressing or being evil, it was no wonder she kept up with the self-sabotage programme.Late people often have a sunny outlook. They are unreasonably optimistic about how many things they can cram in and how long it takes to get from the office to the restaurant, say, especially if it is nearby. My book editor and I often have lunch in a cafe next door to her office and she is always seven minutes late, because she leaves at 1pm. I think she believes she possesses a teleporter, yet, by the time she has chatted to a colleague in the lobby and waited for the lift, she is seven minutes late. I am considering getting there seven minutes late myself, except, as an early person with my own set of neuroses, that would make me ill with anxiety.Lateness can also be caused when we have a reluctance to change gear – to end one activity and start another. We don’t like getting up, we put off going to bed. Stopping something we are absorbed in to do something else can be annoying. It takes willpower to carry out. But if we don’t change gear in time when someone is waiting for us, we are in danger of being judged as selfish.Some late people choose to accept that they are terrible timekeepers and that they can’t do anything about it. Yet punctual people think they know that late people could decide to be on time and follow through.It is only when the latecomers make the decision to be punctual that they change. It must be a conscious decision if they merely make a woolly attempt to “try” to be on time, they won’t be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f9ba70e6696d5cf439c5447b7a1bfbf87b7d62/49_0_2779_1667/master/2779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf93767e0c77f09d2cec4ec388132f0a","title":"writers try 10 big fitness apps weightlifting pilates","story":"There are a dizzying number of apps promising to get you in shape – even if you can’t get to a gym.

I am not very flexible at all, and it turns out that my baseline fitness leaves much to be desired in terms of core strength.More frustrating is the fact that the various workouts are introduced as videos.

None of this stops it from absolutely destroying me with bodyweight exercises – but it is the thought that counts.The instructors are great, with the right level of enthusiasm (read: grating in any other context).

The main workout app lets you set a goal, then pick workouts from a list, but the presentation of the workouts is much simpler than its competitors: just a list of exercises and reps, which you check off as you go.The problem is that much of the app is effectively broken, with visual artefacts – graphical glitches – all over the place. Digging in, the cause is clear: really, the app is a gateway to a coaching business, where you can spend anything from $1 to $250 a month on a one-on-one consultation with a personal trainer.Worth a download?

You need a gym, a squat rack, a barbell and a bench. You don’t need to memorise a list of different exercises, nor wonder which equipment you are going to need today, nor, really, think.StrongLifts is the best introduction to this type of workout there is, providing basic coaching and tracking, as well as just enough motivation to get you to lift the next set. It is my personal favourite: in a year, I have gone from struggling with a 20kg bar to reliably squatting my own weight.Worth a download?

While the personal trainers are front and centre, they mostly exist as silent models demonstrating the best form for each exercise.That may suit a certain type of self-motivated student. Less helpful, for me, is the approach to equipment. I feel as if Nike expects me to have an incredibly well-stocked home – with multiple dumbbells, a skipping rope and a bench – or make myself hugely unpopular at the gym by seizing six things at once. That said, most of the app is available for free – a price you can’t beat.Worth a download? Yes, if free is the magic number. AHPrice £14.99 a month or £88 a year.What is it? The chance to have your workout (for the home and gym) and diet plan organised by not only one Instagram influencer, but five – inspired by everything from powerlifting and muay thai to yoga.The experience Kayla Itsines was one of the first internet exercise influencers. She rose to fame with the Bikini Body Guides, her series of fitness ebooks (the name hasn’t aged well). Itsines still offers the BBG programme, but it now includes variations for different fitness levels. This feels like an app that could stay fresh for well over a year. I like that there are modifications for various exercises, that it is easy to sync to Spotify, and that it put so much emphasis on rest and rehabilitation to enhance healing.The meal-planning features are disappointing, though. There is no option to swap suggested recipes, but as some of the suggestions are as unimaginative as “egg and salad roll”, I imagine quite a few people would want to.Worth a download? Yes – for the exercise, at least.CKPrice $9.99 a month or $59.99 a year.What is it? It is all about exercise on Sworkit, and there is a hell of a lot of it. You can choose from a variety of plans or one-off workouts, customisable by time or focused on body parts (Sworkit is quite invested in firming bums).The experience This has one of the best interfaces for exercising of the apps I tried. It works in landscape, counts you in before the next exercise starts and has a preview window to mentally prepare you for the next move. You can alter music within the exercise window and set how long you want to exercise for, with sessions beginning at five minutes. It also has a great voiceover feature: think of the sort of thing a gym instructor might say, such as “keep your toes pointing outward”. The app sends out push notifications to encourage you to exercise, but the upkeep of a plan does not depend on exercising every day. So, beginners can set their own pace.I can’t work out if the instructor figures on Sworkit are AI or humans, but either way I liked them. Sworkit has tried to make its instructors erse – there are men and women in a variety of sizes. It is a small thing, but I appreciate not always having to follow someone with the figure of a goddess.Worth a download? Yes, especially for beginners. None of Sworkit’s sessions require equipment, so if you ever work out at home or while travelling, it can’t be beaten. CKPrice $16.99 a month.What is it? The Instagram influencer Anna Victoria rose to fame with her downloadable workout plans known as the FBGs (or Fit Body Guides) and pictures of smoothie bowls. Here, she brings together her fitness and food advice in one app, offering 12-week exercise and nutrition programmes, including a customisable meal planner.The experience The app provides a series of 12-week plans to last you 60 weeks (for home or gym, for weight loss or sculpting etc), a forum for users, a journal to log notes and a healthy-meal planner, which aims to spoon-feed the user into eating well (the nutrition section generates your recipes and grocery list for the week as well as reminding you when to drink water).I couldn’t get to grip with all of this, but when I tried it out there were some excellent features – a nutrition guide that is not just about calorie-counting (although the variety of the dishes may bore food lovers), plus educational videos (such as breathing dos and don’ts) to help newcomers to regular exercise. The downsides? The app doesn’t work in landscape mode, so checking the demo during workouts is difficult. Also, workouts often require equipment. I am not convinced the app would work for total novices (push-ups in week one for a woman seems ambitious, not to mention the amount of vicious burpees), while scanning future weeks leaves me wondering if it might get boring.Worth a download? Unless you are a fan of Victoria and her style, I can’t see it delivering enough. CKPrice £1.78 a week for training £2.66 including nutrional information.What is it? Touted as a digital personal trainer, this app has a cultish fanbase thanks to its detailed personalised fitness plans. The experience You can join in with the short but intense fitness challenges, or a variety of running, bodyweight or gym workouts. Users can opt for workouts anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes long, and can select sessions based on parts of the body. So far, so normal. But it is the Coach programme that stands out. The personal plans are created by algorithms that pool the data of users with similar stats to chart your journey. Key to this is regular logging you will record your details when you first start (height, weight, general fitness level) and log after each workout, telling the app how tough you found it.Freeletics promises its workouts will be hard, but not so hard that you give up. It is the feedback moments that allow it to alter your plan accordingly, based on the behaviour of other users who had similar experiences. As with a real coach, there are plenty of demo videos and tutorials to guide you through, plus helpful nudges to drink water and sleep well. The Coach can even detect if you are overtraining. Freeletics also has a fairly busy meetup community, providing some of the social elements of exercise that can be lost when training at home. Plus, the exercises don’t require any equipmentWorth a download? Absolutely, if you have some experience of exercising – it could be a little overwhelming for a total newbie. CKPrice Free from £1.99 a week for the premium version.What is it? A 30-day programme with levels from beginner to pro.The experience Month-long challenges have become a staple of modern fitness. This app capitalises on the idea that people can do anything if it is in short bursts, hence the idea of daily sessions for 30 days.Most of the challenges are focused on a specific area – there is the “flat belly challenge” and the “slim arms challenge” – but nearly all involve a full-body workout. The video tutorials are clear and there are 400 workouts in the library if you feel like doing something completely different outside of the challenge. The end result should be that your overall fitness is improved.Worth a download? Absolutely – 30-day challenges may not be for everyone, but, unlike many other apps, there is plenty to do for free.

But taking a few simple steps can make a huge difference to your happiness – and your performance in the officeWhat would it take to make our working lives better? Steve Jobs once said about work that it was our life’s mission to “do what you love”, but for most of us it is the compromise of “finding what you can put up with”. So, if most of us are never exactly going to love work, what can we do to make it a little less awful?For starters, let’s be honest about what work is like. According to the magazine Management Today, the average Briton spends 16 hours a week in meetings, hostage to the drone of people they vaguely recognise. This is why most of us have learned that to survive in the modern workplace we need to master the “I’m not listening, but want you to think I am” nod, along with the subtle art of checking WhatsApp under a notebook.But there are simple steps we can take to start rebalancing this relationship with our workplace. Researchers have found that even the most miserable job can be redeemed by taking back a little control.When workplace experts study what makes a good day at work, the answers are common sense. We say we have had a satisfying time when we have “made progress in something meaningful”. For many of us, stranded in a vast, open-plan savannah, playing email Tetris, the idea of progress feels unobtainable.This may be because one of the biggest challenges for human brains is switching between activities. Various attempts to measure our attention have suggested that, when we switch tasks, it takes between eight and 20 minutes for our attention to focus fully again.This is where the author Dan Pink has a valuable tip. Pink’s approach is to do one action, his MIT (most important thing), before he does anything else. This way, if the MIT takes up to an hour of concentration, he has made progress on something before the email onslaught begins.Yes, this might be embarrassing to suggest – but if anyone laughs, point out that researchers say going for a walking meeting can be one of the easiest ways to revive your mojo.Interestingly, walking needs to be used appropriately: it is a powerful way to liberate ideas, but it is not the most effective way to resolve complex logical puzzles. The researchers also found that the power of walking lingered after the walk. Taking a stroll before undertaking a creative task fostered a significant uplift compared with staying seated. Other research, from a paper published in 2012, said that going for a 50-minute walk in nature can have a strong effect on our ability to concentrate.Are your colleagues still sniggering? Just ignore them – safe in the knowledge that JK Rowling said night-time walks are the surest way to overcome writer’s block.British workers are well versed in eating al desko, but taking a step away from our workstations for a proper recovery more than pays its way – and not just at work. Psychologists from Baylor University in Texas found a relationship between people skipping lunch breaks and feeling exhausted at the weekend.Despite this, many of us feel a silent pressure to work through lunch. But there is good evidence that stepping away from our desks improves our work, too. Our attention is measurably worse later in the day – a 2006 study of workers at a medical centre in North Carolina found that the likelihood of a medical error occurring was four times higher at 4pm than at 9am. Our afternoon selves, rendered dopey with tiredness, simply are not as effective – and taking a break is one of the best ways to get back some of our zing. Research at Harvard University found that giving schoolchildren five-minute breaks every hour improved their results over the course of a day, whereas a lack of breaks saw their results spiral downwards (with the biggest declines among the least able pupils).If you need more persuading, think about this: skipping an hour’s lunch over the course of a year is the equivalent of five weeks’ holiday. So, make plans to meet a friend or to go to the gym – it could improve your whole week.Researchers at Harvard found that workers were crushed by the daily burden of emails and the need to be contactable at all hours. The worst afflicted were management consultants, who often checked emails if they awoke to go to the loo in the night. Modest changes, such as taking one evening a week off email, were suggested. The management consultants couldn’t quite bear this, so they devised a scheme where one person was always checking night-time emails, while the rest of their colleagues had the evening off. The participants were euphoric. The mere thought of having a night off email duty seemed to have a measurable impact on their stress levels.Bruce Daisley is the European vice-president of Twitter.

Its performance and those of Northern and West Midlands Trains have prompted city mayors to demand immediate improvement.Bruce Williamson, of the pressure group Railfuture, said: “Welcome to another decade of misery for rail passengers. How on earth is the government going to meet its climate commitments by pricing people off environmentally friendly trains and on to our polluted and congested roads?”The government said it was trialling new fares to reflect modern working and travelling patterns as part of a “year of action” towards improving the railways.Commuters on some Govia Thameslink Railway routes will be able to buy tickets providing better value for part-time and flexible workers. On some LNER routes, much cheaper off-peak single-leg tickets will be available. Currently most long-distance singles cost virtually the same price as a return fare.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the government would reform rail to “ensure the focus is always on putting passengers first”. He added: “Delivering such significant change will take time, but passengers can have total confidence that these trials will help provide the evidence needed to develop wider reforms to the fares system and a significantly better service.”A full review of how the rail system operates was commissioned by Chris Grayling as transport secretary in the wake of timetable chaos in 2018, and its findings are due to be published shortly. The former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is chairing the review, has said fares will be one key area for reform.Labour pointed out that rail fares were being cut in Germany while they increased in the UK. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “It shows that this government is not serious about supporting either public transport or tackling climate change, road congestion or air quality.”The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Working people have had enough of overcrowded and unreliable services. The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders.”The RMT union said rolling stock companies, which lease trains to operators, had paid £2.4bn to shareholders in the last 10 years.The Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the industry, said there was continued investment with more than 1,000 new carriages and more than 1,000 additional services coming in across the UK in 2020.However, politicians across Britain are losing patience. The mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, has given Abellio-run West Midlands Trains an ultimatum to sort out its “simply woeful service” by the end of January or he will formally request that the government ends its franchise.Meanwhile, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, have repeatedly urged the government to strip Arriva of the Northern rail franchise and said TransPennine Express should be next, after weeks of delays and cancellations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd258c6a2e9ec90bb07cde62fbae58aecac8013/0_634_3198_1918/master/3198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901abc7d8e7a14aabd4135dc8334725a","title":"tribunal to hear case of sacked ethical vegan","story":"Jordi Casamitjana argues veganism is a philosophical belief and thus protected in lawA legal hearing is due to get under way in Norwich on Thursday to determine whether veganism is a “philosophical or religious belief” and thus protected in law.Jordi Casamitjana says he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after raising concerns that its pension fund was being invested in companies involved in animal testing.He claims he was unfairly disciplined for making this disclosure and that the decision to dismiss him was because of his philosophical belief in ethical veganism.Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation including not wearing clothing made from wool or leather and not using products tested on animals.Casamitjana’s lawyers say ethical veganism satisfies the tests required for it to be a philosophical or religious belief, which means it should protected under the Equality Act 2010.For a belief to be protected under the act, it must meet a series of tests including being worthy of respect in a democratic society, being compatible with human dignity and not conflicting with the fundamental rights of others.Peter Daly, a solicitor with Slater and Gordon who is acting for Casamitjana, said: “Ethical veganism is a philosophical belief held by a significant portion of the population in the UK and around the world. This case, if successful, will establish that the belief entitles ethical vegans to protection from discrimination.“The case we have prepared sets out how the belief in principle, and how Jordi’s particular interpretations of it, meet the required legal test.”When he initially brought the case, Casamitjana said it was not primarily about his dismissal but about establishing ethical veganism as a philosophical belief.“Although the manner in which I was dismissed was intensely distressing for me, some good may come of it if I am able to establish this valuable protection for all ethical vegans,” he said. “If we are successful in that hearing, we will then proceed to a hearing on the specifics of my dismissal.”The League Against Cruel Sports says it sacked Casamitjana for gross misconduct. In a statement to the BBC, it said: “The League Against Cruel Sports is an inclusive employer, and as this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the league does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79bcee38dd5a53d675260a3f78c730d5094e58bb/0_181_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548c5926d135b1f31289ef980fb97aff","title":"the strange world of tiktok a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

The new leader will be elected in March after Corbyn said he would step down following the party’s catastrophic general election defeat.The results at this preliminary stage suggest that the winner is unlikely to come from the left of the party, according to Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, who jointly ran the poll with the University of Sussex.“This is not shaping up to be a 2015-style Labour leadership contest. Unless potential candidates drop out before the start of voting, it may take a few rounds to decide the winner this time around.“But it doesn’t look at the moment as if the winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory,” he said.So far only the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have officially said they want to run to be the next Labour leader.Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, are expected to stand while the former Labour minister and home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, is understood to be weighing up her options as to whether she will vie for the leadership for a second time.The party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery – who lambasted the party’s performance for their muddled stance on Brexit – might also run. A former National Union of Mineworkers chair who supports leaving the EU, he would be the most leftwing of all the potential candidates.The poll will be interesting reading for all those who said they were using the Christmas break to decide whether to launch official campaigns and gain the signatures of MPs needed to get on the ballot.There is little difference between the popularity of the candidates between men and women, although Long Bailey is fractionally more popular among male members.“It certainly doesn’t look as if Labour’s members are necessarily persuaded that it’s time the party had a female leader. They seem more interested in picking the best person for the job, irrespective of gender,” said Bale, who co-wrote Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st century with Webb and Monica Poletti.Starmer is also shown in the survey to be more popular than Long Bailey in all age groups but particularly with those aged over 60. He also was more popular with middle-class members by 14 percentage points over Long Bailey.Much of the reflection among members after the election has been on whether Labour needs someone from the north of England to reconnect to voters in former heartland seats that fell to the Tories.However, the most northern of all the MPs – Lisa Nandy – does not seem any more popular among Labour members living in the north than with those in other UK regions.Labour’s northern members seem to be just as keen as members from other parts of the country on Starmer, who represents Holborn and St Pancras in north London.Bale said: “For all the talk of Labour needing some ‘northern grit’ in order to help it regain its so-called northern wall seats and working-class voters, it looks like the membership are more interested in who they think will do the best job than where or what background they come from.”The survey of 1,059 Labour members, weighted by age, gender and region, was commissioned from YouGov by the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and run by Prof Tim Bale (Queen Mary University of London) and Prof Paul Webb (University of Sussex)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d568e49e9f6d0ec29ea6d30ba75dffdcc11936a/0_93_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0352b6dcdb464463fdb3cd2dd29e33b4","title":"labour leadership contest blow to continuity corbyn project as poll of members suggests starmer clear favourite live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThe New Statesman’s Stephen Bush has written a good blog about the YouGov Labour leadership poll. He says that it feels “about right” as an account of opinion in the party at the moment, but that a lot could change. It is worth reading the article in full, but here’s an extract.One of the many, many errors that people make in reporting the Labour Party rank and file is imagining that it is a hyper-engaged and incredibly online group of people. This is not the case. The average Labour member is a socially concerned person who gets their news via the ’s website and the BBC. They are also not particularly factional: Momentum, the organisation that grew out of Corbyn’s first leadership election, is the largest factional organisation in Labour politics by some distance: but only one around one in every ten Labour Party members is a Momentum member.The moment when Jeremy Corbyn sealed the deal with Labour members in 2015 was not on Twitter, or even on Facebook. It was in the first televised debate of the race. That was when, according to the private polling I obtained at the time, he first opened up a lead among Labour members.This is just supposition based on anecdote, but my impression is that there are five candidates in this contest who are well-known and about whom Labour members have strong opinions: Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Yvette Cooper, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. These candidates have the least room to grow – I’m not saying it is impossible for them to improve their standing among Labour Party members, but they are the ones who are competing against strongly held preconceptions about them.Opinions about Lisa Nandy and Clive Lewis are for the most part up for grabs and therefore they could do much better than suggested by these polls – if they get onto the ballot, which is not certain for either.The process to strip Northern rail of its franchise has begun after years of poor performance, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said. My colleague Rajeev Syal has the full story here.The YouGov figures showing how votes might get redistributed in a Labour leadership contest (see 10.21am) are worth studying because they show that some assumptions about how people might use their second preference votes might be wrong.For example, you might think that anyone backing Emily Thornberry would be inclined to opt for Sir Keir Starmer as their next choice because he’s another strongly pro-European north London senior lawyer who performs well in the Commons. But the YouGov figures suggest Rebecca Long Bailey would pick up almost as many Thornberry votes as Starmer in the first instance.The YouGov figures assume Lisa Nandy would drop out after the first round of voting, with her votes being distributed fairly evenly amongst the remaining candidates. Thornberry would drop out next, YouGov suggests, boosting Starmer by 3 points and Long Bailey by two points. Clive Lewis would fall out next under this scenario, with his support being split evenly between Starmer and Long Bailey. Yvette Cooper would be the next to be eliminated, YouGov suggests, with half of her votes going to Starmer, and the rest split between Jess Phillips and Long Bailey. And Phillips would be the last person to drop out, with her votes breaking 2 to 1 for Starmer.Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone.It certainly is for supporters of Sir Keir Starmer as next Labour leader. Over the last three weeks he and Rebecca Long Bailey have been seen as more or less joint favourites for the post - but for different reasons. Starmer has been seen as a likely winner because he is highly regarded by the public at large and if ‘looking like a credible PM’ were the sole criterion for the job, he would probably easily beat the other candidates. But Long Bailey was seen as a likely winner because she was highly regarded by the Corbynites at the top of the party, and it was assumed that if they wanted her in the top job, the pro-Corbyn membership would duly vote for her too.But the first poll of Labour members since the election defeat suggests that the second assumption is wrong, and that Starmer will prove much more popular with members. My colleague Kate Proctor has written it up here.This is how her story starts.Keir Starmer has emerged as an early frontrunner in the Labour leadership race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn after a poll of members suggested he was the first choice in all regions of the UK, age groups and social classes.The shadow Brexit secretary is yet to formally launch his campaign but is expected to do so in the first few weeks of the new year. The new leader will be elected in March after Corbyn said he would step down following the party’s catastrophic general election defeat.Jess Phillips, the chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, who has yet to declare if she is running, was the third most popular choice among members, who were surveyed between 20 and 30 December.And here is a  graphic with some of the key figures.It is routine to point out that polling can be unreliable (although that is not something people have been saying since the general election result, which was broadly in line with what the pollsters were predicting). And polling party members is harder than polling the public at large, because there are fewer of them. But YouGov can poll Labour members because it has a vast number of people on its database, and in 2015 and in 2016 its Labour membership polls turned out to be reliable guides to the outcome of the two elections that Jeremy Corbyn won handsomely.The fact that Starmer is so far ahead at this stage does not mean he has it in the bag. He has not even announced his candidature yet and a lot could change during the campaign, particularly when candidates face the sort of scrutiny that they have never received before.It is also important to remember that YouGov just polled Labour party members. In the leadership campaign two other categories of people get to vote: people affiliated to Labour through membership of a trade union or a socialist society, and people who pay a one-off fee to get a vote as a registered supporter. Although these two groups are broadly similar in outlook to Labour members, they don’t vote in exactly the same way. In 2015 and in 2016 the registered supporters were proportionately significantly more pro-Corbyn than members and affiliates.And the fact that this poll has now come out will affect the dynamics of the contest. It will establish Starmer as the clear front-runner - and incentivise his opponents. Labour’s national executive committee is meeting next week to determine the timetable for the leadership election, and how the registered supporters scheme will operate for this contest, and in so far as the NEC is controlled by a particular faction in the party, it is not a faction that wants Starmer to win. Andrew Adonis, the pro-European Labour peer, is one of the Labour figures who has welcomed the poll findings on Twitter this morning.But Steve Howell, who was deputy director of strategy and communications for Labour in the 2017, has said that Starmer would be the wrong choice. Howell does not have a party role at the moment, but his views are always worth paying attention to because they tend to align with those of the “4Ms” - Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s communications chief, Karie Murphy, Labour’s elections chief, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, and Andrew Murray, an adviser to McCluskey and Corbyn - who are seen as four of the most powerful figures in the Corbyn leadership.It looks as if it is going to be a quiet news day but, as usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb048bba3607e286efdc52107924de3f3643b73c/0_365_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f7d97a4030b6d96f509620339f2c38","title":"chameleon cushions and hydroponic gardens welcome to the smart home of the future","story":"In little more than a decade our homes could look very different. Daniel Robson explores how the future is closer than we think The concept reads like the set-design notes for a Star Trek movie: home furnishings that change colour and shape according to your mood, modular rooms that can be added to your home, and bathrooms that can track your health statistics. But the era of the smart eco-home may actually be closer than you think.Futurologists and energy experts say that by 2030, we could be able to use existing reconfigurable materials and augmented reality to change the shape of our furniture, for example changing a brown leather sofa into a plush red velvet one, simply by commanding our in-home AI system. Smart cushions will change colour like chameleons to suit your mood. Bed covers will adapt to your body temperature for maximum snuggling.Innovations are afoot in the kitchen, too. Hydroponic gardens are already a reality, used in a growing number of restaurants around the world and even in branches of Veggie Pret – but by 2030 we may have these at home. Hydroponics uses LED lights to grow vegetables without soil in a compact space, and to keep them fresh for longer. And smart appliances such as kettles and toasters will store energy during off-peak times, so that they are cheaper to use when you actually need them. For now, though, we have smart meters and not only are they making us more energy efficient, they are going to be a main player in reaching the UK’s 2050 emissions target.Meanwhile, smart bathrooms may help to improve efficiency by generating power from toilet and shower wastewater, or even filtering it to make the home water self-sufficient.Buildings will be made from recycled materials, with improved insulation and solar panels on the rooftops and even in the windows. Modular rooms can be added as your family grows and then removed again when the kids leave home, allowing a more controlled usage of the energy supply. Sensors could track residents around the house, adjusting the temperature and lighting in each room accordingly.At the heart of this system are smart meters. Already available at no additional cost across Britain from your energy supplier, these gadgets monitor household energy use throughout the day and report data back to network operators, which helps to predict demand and generate the supply accordingly. They also tell users when electricity rates are cheapest, for more cost-efficient use.“A smart energy system makes it easier for us to draw on and store electricity when it’s less in demand, and then use it again when scarce or more expensive later in the day,” says Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs, Smart Energy GB. “Together, smart meters and a smart energy system help to create a cleaner, greener Britain.”There are already 15.6m smart meters installed in homes and businesses across Britain, and these devices not only make efficient energy use easy through visibility of consumption, they also display your near-real time costs in pounds and pence so that you can keep in better control of your spending.Stepping further into sci-fi utopia, smart meters can help to unlock the possibility of a shared electricity system for each local community, taking advantage of shared renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms, and powering things like a communal electric car pool as a convenient yet eco-friendly alternative to public transport.Electric car ownership is likely to rise anyway, as new government legislation will soon make it compulsory for all new-build homes with a dedicated parking space to include a charging point. With the help of a smart meter and a smart charger, cars will charge during off-peak hours, reducing the cost of fuel to as little as 3p per mile – compared with 11p for petrol and diesel cars.“There might even be instances where you could get paid to charge your car when the power system needs us to use more power,” said futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, during a panel discussion hosted by Smart Energy GB.With fossil fuels, it is easy for the energy companies to control the supply – when more power is needed, they just burn more coal. But renewable energy does not work this way: sun and wind power dictate their own routines.The best part is, you won’t even have to think about it. Once the system is set up, the smart meter, alongside your smart appliances, chargers and services will do all the work, managing your supply automatically according to your preferences. And the addition of batteries will make it possible to store power in the home.Saving energy, saving money, saving the environment. Smart eco-homes (and the smart meters that enable them) will become an integral part of a greener Britain – and the future could be with us in less than a decade.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

Saracens say that a new independent chairman will be “appointed imminently”.In the meantime, Edward Griffiths will take up the role of interim chief executive for a 12-month period and Mitesh Velani will assume a consultancy position at Saracens and remain on their board.In a statement on their website, the 71-year-old Wray said: “As we enter a new year, a new decade, it is time for the club to make a fresh start. I am not getting any younger and feel this is the right moment for me to stand down as chairman and just enjoy being a fan of this incredible rugby club. I will always be committed to the wonderful Saracens family.“The Wray family will continue to provide the required financial support to the club, and I will remain actively engaged in the work of the Saracens Sport Foundation and Saracens High School, as part of the Club’s ongoing commitment to our community in north London.”Wray has provided financial backing for Saracens throughout the sport’s 25-year professional era. His tenure also saw a level of sustained success on domestic and European stages.Saracens, though, are battling to stay in the top flight this term following the points deduction for breaching salary cap regulations in the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons by failing to disclose payments to players.

I’ve limited myself to Britain this time, because that brings the number of races to consider down to a manageable 100,000 or so. The main criterion is which races still live clearly in my memory, so it’s a very personal list with which you are almost certain to disagree, in which case please add your own list in the comments.Cue Card’s epic career fits snugly into the decade, as he made his first appearance in a Fontwell bumper on 25 January 2010 and his last in the Ryanair of 2018. Few horses offered such a guarantee of drama there were two Festival wins but also two falls in the Gold Cup, including one when he really might have won it. But the race to remember him for was at Kempton, when he ran down a non-staying Vautour in the final strides. Silviniaco Conti, Don Cossack, Smad Place and Al Ferof provided a fine supporting cast.Tipsters love predictable horses and Sole Power was that for sure. Give him five furlongs on fast ground and you’d see something electric. I’ve picked his second win in the King’s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot, in 2014, but there were a few days when he ran very similar races, being held up for an irresistible late surge that was thrilling to watch, whether you were for him or against. It feels important to include one of the many wins achieved by Richard Hughes, who looked better on a hold-up horse than any other jockey in my memory, folded up like one of those Jacob’s Ladder toys, suggesting there was any amount left in the tank.Some risk of recency bias here, since this King George (Ascot version) was just over five months ago, but it featured a record-setting champion prevailing after a prolonged tussle, with several Group One winners behind her. Maybe I should have this higher on the list? He didn’t win but Crystal Ocean came out best at the weights and this race will be the best memorial for a splendidly game horse who seems sure to be under-appreciated by history.One of the most astonishing performances ever seen on a racecourse anywhere, as the combustible Frankel was allowed to stride on from the start. He was soon clear and stayed there, the crowd applauding from more than a furlong out. You can use the placed horses to pull down the value of the form but we know that Frankel was one of the greats. This win, with its unorthodox tactics, was the reassurance that he wasn’t just going to be remembered as a flashy two-year-old.We spent so many years building up the Gold Cup as a clash between Kauto Star and Denman but the battle we were hoping for didn’t really come off. Kauto Star seemed off his game in 2008, then Denman had the heart problem that undermined his career. By the time of the 2011 race, they were both 11 and still hugely talented but surely past their best. And yet there they both were, duking for the lead over the third-last and into the straight, before youth swept past in the figure of Long Run, just six and so full of promise. That admirable pair Imperial Commander and Tidal Bay were also in the line-up. And the memory is sweetened by the knowledge that this wasn’t even Kauto Star’s last hurrah, as he had a Betfair Chase and a King George to win later that year. It was one of the most purely enjoyable races I can remember.Brian Hughes might improve his chance of a first jockeys’ title at Ayr, despite the presence of the reigning champ, Richard Johnson. Hughes replaces a 7lb claimer aboard Teescomponentstrig (1.00), who was a strong-finishing second on his handicap debut last month. The 9-4 is fair.Portrush Ted is the big name on the card but it’s not clear that he’s got in lightly on this handicap debut, even if he is at his best, which must be in doubt after such a long absence and with the yard in modest form. Eternally Yours (2.40) could be a better bet at 4-1, as she surely needed her reappearance run at Carlisle in November.At Lingfield, Deadly Accurate (3.30) could be worth a look at 7-1 on his first start for Ian Williams. He was rated 20lb higher at the end of 2018 and Joe Fanning is an encouraging booking for a potential front-runner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4188d9665c33215f73f0c8566dd0bd5bb21df8e/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=194331400778735e751d7b8ccbd33c67","title":"theatre dance comedy 2020 preview","story":"Tom Stoppard gets personal, Cush Jumbo does Hamlet, Hollywood names bring everything from tragedy to comedy … plus dance confronts shame and there’s standup open heart surgeryby  Arifa Akbar,  Lyndsey Winship and  Brian LoganTrevor Nunn’s trio of short Beckett plays dwells on ageing and the unreliability of memory, kicking off with Krapp’s Last Tape starring James Hayes, followed by Eh Joe, the first drama Beckett wrote for television, which features the voice of Billie Whitelaw’s mentee Lisa Dwan opposite Niall Buggy.

A modern myth about twin sisters who travel from the south to California to “exact righteous revenge”, it draws on influences that range from spaghetti westerns to hip-hop and Afropunk, and explores what it means to be black and female, alongside patricide and family dysfunction. It seems perfectly paired with Ola Ince, the director of acclaimed and edgy productions from Debris Stevenson’s Poet in Da Corner to Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ Appropriate. Royal Court, London, 20 July-15 AugustZadie Smith published her debut novel, White Teeth, in 2000. Twenty years later comes her debut play: a reimagining of Chaucer’s The Wife of Bath, which shed light on the role of women in the late middle ages and was the bawdiest of all the Canterbury Tales. Smith re-envisages Chaucer’s story in the west London borough where she was raised, raising questions about women’s place in society today. Kiln theatre, London, DecemberPhoenix Dance Theatre’s artistic director Sharon Watson continues to tackle serious political stories through dance. This time it is two shameful incidents of British colonial history: the massacre of more than 130 African slaves aboard the Zong ship in 1781, and the incarceration of freedom fighters at Kala Pani prison in Raj-era India. Black Waters is, unusually, jointly created by three choreographers – Watson, Shambik Ghose and Mitul Sengupta – bringing a trio of perspectives to the stage. Leeds Playhouse, 12-15 February. Then touringOne of the late Pina Bausch’s legendary early works for Tanztheater Wuppertal, from 1977, remarkably never before performed in the UK. Here it gets a belated premiere (and the first staging anywhere for 29 years). It’s a disturbing piece, drawing loosely on Béla Bartók’s opera in its illustration of a murderously dysfunctional couple – the misery between men and women being one of Bausch’s enduring themes. Bluebeard is both more dancerly and more raw and radical than much of Bausch’s later work.Sadler’s Wells, London, 12-15 FebruaryThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the BalletBoyz company. Back in 2000 it was a breakaway project for two ex-Royal Ballet dancers, Michael Nunn and William Trevitt now it’s a strong company of young male dancers, as well as a launchpad for Nunn and Trevitt’s film-making. The company’s new stage show, Deluxe, features choreography from Shanghai-based Xie Xin and and a piece by Punchdrunk’s Maxine Doyle, set to live music from Mercury-nominated jazz saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi.Theatre Royal, Glasgow, 1 March. Then touring.Choreographer Crystal Pite’s first collaboration with writeractor Jonathon Young yielded arguably the best dance work of the century so far, Bettroffenheit. So hopes are exceedingly high for their new piece, Revisor, an ambitious revision of Nikolai Gogol’s 1836 farce The Government Inspector in which Pite and Young turn their hands to political satire. Early reviews suggest a clever, challenging and thought-provoking work. Sadler’s Wells, London, 3-5 MarchIf you’ve seen Thom Yorke and Paul Thomas Anderson’s short film Anima, you’ve already seen some of the choreography for Black Marrow, created by Damien Jalet and Iceland Dance Company’s artistic director Erna Ómarsdóttir. The cool Reykjavik company presents the full work, which asks urgent questions about humans’ reliance on oil. Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 21 MarchThe first show announced for 2020’s Brighton festival is a new creation from choreographer Hofesh Shechter that will play in a double bill with 2016’s Clowns and promises to be a foil for that piece’s unsettling energy. Meanwhile Shechter’s blisteringly talented apprentice company, Shechter II, celebrates the 10th anniversary of his acclaimed Political Mother by taking the work that once shredded speakers at Brixton Academy on an “unplugged” tour of smaller venues. Brighton festival, 2-3 MayFollowing years of obscurity, New York choreographer Pam Tanowitz leapt to the top of everyone’s must-see list when she brought her version of TS Eliot’s Four Quartets to London last May, with its rich textures and Cunningham-influenced lines. Goldberg Variations is the piece that preceded Four Quartets in 2016 and pushed Tanowitz into the spotlight in the US. Here it gets its European premiere, performed by seven dancers surrounding the grand piano of Simone Dinnerstein.Barbican, London, 6-9 MayA mega-project from choreographer Wayne McGregor and some stellar collaborators including composer Thomas Adès and artist Tacita Dean. McGregor es into Dante’s Divine Comedy in an epic journey through purgatory and into paradise with, no doubt, his usual questing sense of physical and intellectual exploration. And while you’re booking Royal Ballet tickets, get one for Cathy Marston’s new piece The Cellist, about Jacqueline du Pré (17 Feb to 4 Mar). Royal Opera House, London, 6 May-1 JuneExciting times in Birmingham as Carlos Acosta takes over as artistic director at Birmingham Royal Ballet in January. The first taste of his programming comes in the summer at a festival celebrating this new chapter for BRB. Full details are still to be announced, but we know it features Acosta’s own spirited production of Don Quixote and a mixed bill that opens with a duet created by Spanish choreographer Goyo Montero for Acosta and the amazing Alessandra Ferri.Birmingham Hippodrome, JuneFormer Royal Ballet principal turned song-and-dance man Adam Cooper reprises his star turn as Don Lockwood, the Gene Kelly role in MGM classic Singin’ in the Rain. Jonathan Church’s joyful production originally opened in 2011 at Chichester Festival and played in the West End. It returns for a summer season at Sadler’s Wells, with Olivier award-nominated choreography from Andrew Wright and 14,000 litres of water on stage each night.Sadler’s Wells, London, 24 July-30 AugustWho gets to decide what’s womanly? One of the breakout acts of 2019’s Edinburgh fringe, Fostekew made waves – and secured a Comedy award nomination – with her show Hench, about femininity and the muscular female body. Now touring, it’s full of no-nonsense attitude and big-hitting set pieces about the dieting industry, childbirth and Fostekew’s fraught relationship with her bolshy little boy. Soho theatre, London, 6-25 January. Then touringThe New Zealand comic with the name as twisty as his loose-limbed body was last seen on these shores performing a double act with his own baby son. Now, as part of the London international mime festival, he returns – in response to a challenge from his countryman Thom Monckton – with a pared-back solo show featuring just one performer, one technician, one light, no text and a stage of only 1m2. Soho theatre, London, 7-25 JanuaryJosie Long’s standup shows are the equivalent of open-heart surgery – with the benefit that it’s her heart that’s open, not yours. Through a lens of politics, love life or now family, they chronicle the ebbs and flows of Long’s optimistic spirit – never more so than with Tender, her joyful latest about pregnancy and childbirth. It delighted Edinburgh audiences last summer, and now – with its blow-by-blow account of new motherhood and ruminations on child-rearing in an overheating world – it takes to the road. Warwick Arts Centre, 23 January. Then touringHis last solo show My Family: Not the Sitcom was one for the ages, a comical but heartfelt account of his parents’ eccentric lives that raised one’s eyebrows to the back of one’s neck and beyond. Now David Baddiel returns with a new one-man show, Trolls: Not the Dolls, about his adventures on the frontier of social media. It promises to be just as lurid. Grand Theatre Swansea, 24 January. Then touringIt seems like only yesterday we were hailing Alexei Sayle’s return to standup after 17 years away. In fact, it was seven years ago – and now he’s touring again, for the first time since (give or take the odd festival gig). More “dangerously political” laughs are promised from the man who put the punk into alternative comedy – before settling down to host recent Radio 4 hit Alexei Sayle’s Imaginary Sandwich Bar. HOME Manchester, 31 January-1 February. Then touringSometimes stoopid is exactly what you want from your comedy, and at such a time, Anna O’Grady and Helen Cripps’ Stuck in a Rat is precisely the ticket. The rookie duo made a splash on the fringe with this faux self-care seminar – the joke being that this summons to sort yourself out was delivered by two complete doofuses, barely able to keep their own show on the road. It’s classic double act stuff, worth catching in February. 5-7 February, Vault festival, LondonHe made his name with heartfelt lefty cris de coeur as the country hit the reactionary skids. But in the last two years, the 28-year-old has inflected his emphatic standup with personal intimacies and spiritual doubt. In his compelling new show Dots, Shah considers the evaporation of his youthful certainties – albeit in the voice of a comic who still sounds ardent about everything. Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, 14 February. Then touringA few years ago, Dane Baptiste was a rising star of UK comedy, with a killer second show (Reasonable Doubts) and an acclaimed BBC sitcom (Sunny D) under his belt, alongside a burgeoning rep for radical commentary on race and politics. If he’s yet fully to deliver on his ambition to be Britain’s Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle – well, 2020 heralds another opportunity, as new show The Chocolate Chip tours the UK. South Street Arts Centre, Reading, 20 February. Then touringIf The Mash Report is the closest the UK has yet come to cultivating its own Daily Show, props are due to Rachel Parris, the smiling assassin whose sections on Trump, Piers Morgan and sexual harassment went viral, putting the show in the public eye. In 2020, Parris takes to the road with a new show, All Change Please, combining political satire with the tart musical comedy with which she originally made her name. Previews at Soho theatre, London, 2-4 March and the Old Market, Brighton, 24 April. Then touringYou know them from TV and the movies: The Three Amigos, Father of the Bride. You may not know that Steve Martin and Martin Short are a jobbing comedy double act, Emmy-nominated for their Netflix special, and UK-bound. “I like to think of this as among the funniest shows the audience has ever seen,” says Martin, of a night that has variously been described as vaudeville and “a children’s show for adults”, and which features solo standup, double-act larks, Martin on banjo and a live band.

So we’ve select 10 of your favourites, from Scottish beaches to Hampshire hillsBest walk for us: start in Thorpe Bay, on the eastern side of Southend and walk all along the coast to Leigh-on-Sea (about five miles). Stop for a warming drink in any of the pubs (Ye Olde Smack or the Peterboat perhaps), or have fish and chips made with locally sourced fish, then return. You could make a longer route by walking Southend pier, the longest in the world – a mile out and a mile back: the seascapes are stunning at this time of year.BabylonianSheDevilWalk from the War Memorial out of Ilmington up Grump Street and Tinkers Lane. Right at the first gate after the houses, down through the field and left after the next gate. Over the hill, right down the lane all the way till you pass the lodge on the right, then right through the gap in the fence, across the field, stop for the hot drink you’ve brought with you. Through the gate, right at the top, right again down Campden Pitch to the path on the right, left at the end of that path and then drop down through the fields where you started. Grab a quick drink and a bag of crisps at the Howard Arms and then home – you’ve had one of the best afternoons you can imagine.Nigel PerryWe love to walk on Holkham beach, north Norfolk, in the winter. It’s beautiful, virtually deserted (unlike in summer) and there are lots of interesting migratory birds to see, including the rare shore lark. You can do a circular walk from Wells-next-the-Sea through the pinewoods behind the dunes and then back along the beach, or vice versa (around 5½ miles in total), or if you get too cold or tired there’s always the Coastliner bus to get you back to your starting point. There’s a cafe at Holkham Bay for hot drinks and snacks, or the Victoria Inn for good pub food.• holkhamSweetjane1957Ten years ago, we took a walk from our home on the mainland side of Portsmouth over Portsdown Hill, aiming for the Golden Lion pub-restaurant in the village of Southwick. There was deep snow (for the south of England), and although we had a map, it wasn’t a lot of use as the tracks were totally covered. What the heck - we struck out anyway, and it was beautiful. We found our way down the far side of the hill (on later walks when the snow had cleared, we discovered we had more or less followed Crooked Walk Lane) and did indeed reach Southwick. We were the only customers in the pub, and lunch was off because the chef hadn’t made it in, but the landlord served us coffee. It’s a favourite pub hike for us now.Eternally HopefulThere are lots of walking opportunities in beautiful Angus, including the glens, and also some coastal walks, with beaches at Montrose, St Cyrus, Lunan Bay, Elliot and Monifieth. Try the amazing coastal cliff walk from Arbroath to Auchmithie before visiting the shingle beach that appears in the 2013 Scarlett Johansson film Under The Skin. Or join the monthly Hospitalfields heritage walks, including the Steading, North Lodge and the Mortuary Chapel.Julie AdamsI’d like to suggest the magnificent cliff walk between Sandyhills and Kippford, via Rockcliffe (about five miles, three to four hours) in Dumfries and Galloway. There’s parkinga bus terminus at Sandyhills (from Dumfries or Dalbeattie). After moderate exertion to start, it goes gently downhill along an easy cliffside with sandy bays, smugglers coves, a ruined chapel and light tower, with Solway, island and coastal views, England in the background, then a lush estuaryside path by the gardens of the villas of Rockcliffe, then into the scenic touristy port of Kippford, with pubs that do food (and a bus back to SandyhillsDumfries or Dalbeattie).• A version of this walk at kirkennanMuttleeWalking on the Blorenge is bleak at this time of year, but there are lots of alternatives. For a walk nearby where you’ll get sweeping vistas and probably meet no one, take the bus from Abergavenny to the Hummingbird shop and cafe in Llanover (for coffee if you need it), walk up past the Goose and Cuckoo and on to the open moor. Head south for Pontypool, eat your lunch at the trig point, and so down through Pontypool Park to get the bus back to Llanover.• A similar walk at visitmonmouthshireeggy123bananaYesterday’s eight-mile freshener sampled the Middlewood Way “linear park” in Higher Poynton, on to a stunning stretch of the Macclesfield canal, and then climbed steadily into the Lyme Park estate.

Do you think there’s no greater pleasure than a brilliant story brilliantly told?You do? Well, have I got good news for you. Which is: BBC One’s new series Dracula is a pure and joyous BELTER. It’s in three parts of 90 glorious minutes each, adapted by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. And it is basically Sherlock but about Dracula. And peak Sherlock at that: seeking always to entertain the audience, revitalising the story while revelling in its absurdity, clever without being clever-clever, and strewn with comic and dramatic flourishes that give you the feeling that this is not just a treat but a tribute – to the author, to the season, to you as an intelligent viewer.Everything you need is here. A dark, unmappable, labyrinthine castle. Gnarled hands resting on balcony ledges, their unseen owner lurking in shadowy recesses. Terrified locals. Bats. Babies crying. Primal fears inescapably roused.The story unfolds within two timeframes, the Now and the Then. In the Now, where we begin, a strangely deformed man is being interviewed in a nunnery by Sister Agatha (Dolly Wells) who – and I’m calling it now – is quite the best nun of all time, and not just because she has no time at all for God. “Like many women my age I am trapped in a loveless marriage, maintaining appearances for the sake of a roof over my head,” she says briskly. She is investigating the man’s tale of escape from someone he calls Count Dracula. The man’s name is Jonathan Harker and he is played by John Heffernan with the same utter conviction brought to the story by the rest of the cast via a script and direction that are all refreshingly devoid of any shred of cynicism. You may point, as apparent disproof of my assertion, to Sister Agatha’s response to Harker’s failure to realise the significance of an SOS message written in English in the heart of eastern Europe: “You are an English man,” she explains. “A combination of presumptions beyond compare.” But you would be wrong. She is simply a truth-teller, unfettered by convention. This is quite different. Also, top nunning. I will brook no riposte.Harker was brought by a fisherman to the nunnery, having been found washed up on the banks of a nearby river muttering about forces of evil. He looks a half-formed thing – bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds’ irradiated Deadpool – as well, it turns out, he might.Harker is a lawyer who was sent to talk a mysterious client through some legal issues at his castle. That’s the Then. The client is an unsettling, old, old man with a – Transylvanian, is it? – accent who says exactly the things you want an old, old man with a Transylvanian accent and an unmappable castle to say. Things such as “I don’t drink … wine”, and “The people around here have no flavour”. “Perhaps you mean ‘character’?” suggests Harker gently. “Perhaps,” replies the old, old man. When asked if there is anyone else living in the place, he replies “No. There’s no one … living here.” It is around this point that you find your bum wriggling its way more firmly into the sofa. The client takes a shine to him, and so Harker must stay. His health fails, he gets weaker by the day – but the years fall away from Dracula until he stands revealed as Danish actor Claes Bang, embodying exactly the wolfish charm and diabolic spirit you love to see in a prince … wait, what am I saying?! The prince of darkness.It’s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with just the faintest hint of ham gothic yarns need a homage to all the great Counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing. And again, like the best of Gatiss and Moffat’s Sherlocks, with the searching intelligence that promises to flesh out the foundational story. Enjoy sinking your teeth into it all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7126b2aecd3fe755588deafd650d928681e079/0_39_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b3ffe7e6fcad6f356897e41ae675e52","title":"calls for tourism boycott add to pressure to reopen cyprus trial","story":"Mother of British teenager found guilty of lying about rape is among those who have publicly rejected the verdictPressure is mounting on the Cypriot authorities to reassess the case of a British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped as anger rises over the verdict.Calls for a tourism boycott of the country were backed by the woman’s mother, who said Ayia Napa, the holiday resort in which her 19-year-old daughter said the attack took place, was unsafe.“If you go and report something that’s happened to you, you’re either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what’s happened to my daughter may happen,” she told the BBC.The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room on 17 July. But after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later, she was charged and a dozen men aged between 15 and 22 who had been arrested over the incident freed.Her mother said the woman, who had been due to begin university in September, was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day as a result of the condition hypersomnia.During a five-month trial, the Briton claimed she had been forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police, telling the judge she was “scared for my life”. On Monday, she was ruled by a judge to have wilfully indulged in public mischief.The teenager, who spent a month in Nicosia general prison before being bailed at the end of August, has been prevented from leaving Cyprus since July. She could face up to a year in prison and a €1,700 (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January.Within hours of the court decision being announced, calls for a boycott appeared on social media. The storm erupted as Britain’s Foreign Office, in a highly unusual step, also raised “serious concerns” over the woman receiving a fair trial.On Monday judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Famagusta’s district court, pronounced that prosecutors had proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.The verdict has also put the government of President Nicos Anastasiades on the defensive.As one of the region’s most popular destinations, with an economy greatly dependent on the tourist industry, calls for a boycott have taken the affair to another level. UK tourists top the league tables of arrivals, and Politis, a leading daily, described the Mediterranean country as being “up against the wall”.But while the government spokesman, Kyriakos Kousios, expressed sympathy for the Briton’s mother, he also described public reaction to the case as “exaggerated”.The island nation’s court system, like its judiciary, was entirely independent of the state mechanism, the spokesman insisted. As a former crown colony, Cyprus’s legal system is based on British law.“As a government we cannot, under any circumstances, intervene in a pending case before the court,” he said, repeating that court proceedings were initiated only after the student retracted her original complaint. “What would happen if a Cypriot was brought before a court in the UK? Would the government intervene and would the Cypriots campaign to boycott England?” he asked.Her lawyers have argued that, in contravention of EU community law, a statement retracting the rape claim was signed by the teenager with no lawyer present and after eight hours of police interrogation that was neither videoed nor recorded. Determined to clear her name, they have vowed to take the case to Cyprus’s supreme court and, if necessary, the European court of human rights.On Monday Papathanasiou argued that, motivated by anger, the teenager had falsely levelled the rape claim against the Israelis, when she realised video clips of her having consensual sex with one of them had been recorded by others in the group on their mobile phones.Her testimony before the court had been “evasive” and “contradictory”, he said. Protesters, led by women activists, have deplored the judgment, calling it the product of a system that remains insensitive to gender and rape.As condemnation of the verdict spreads, so does internal dissent over the way the case has been handled. On Tuesday a former attorney general, Alekos Markides, added to the criticism, saying the matter should have been wrapped up long ago instead of assuming such international proportions. “It should have ended with the one-month prison sentence and not assumed such dimensions,” he told a local radio station.As an offence, causing public mischief was among the lightest on the statute books, he said. Blaming the international outcry on the court’s obstinacy, he also criticised the legal system for targeting “a 19-year-old tourist who we have kept in Cyprus for five months now, a … girl who has a clean criminal record … who we have forced to collect donations to cover her legal costs and have forbidden from travelling to her country. This rigidity of the court has provoked reaction internationally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5df3f91d11cc92fd02293bd51fa76647e50a8af/0_14_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8690f5e1b91f2d486e84e02a92dee90b","title":"huge rise in number of people trying to cross channel to uk by sea","story":"French officials say more than 2,300 people wer picked up last year, up from 586 in 2018The number of people making desperate attempts to cross the Channel by sea from France has quadrupled over the last year.French officials say almost 2,358 people were picked up in the Channel attempting to reach the UK by boat or swimming in 2019, compared with 586 in 2018.In total in 2019 there were 261 crossings or attempted sea crossings, mostly by small, overloaded inflatable craft, leading to four deaths. Fifty-five percent of the attempts were unsuccessful. The most desperate attempted to swim the Channel, which is 20.7 miles across at its narrowest point.On Tuesday more than 40 migrants, including eight children, were intercepted in the Channel by the Border Force. Dozens more, including a pregnant woman, were picked up in the Channel in the days after Christmas.On New Year’s Eve an inflatable craft, carrying six males with hypothermia, according to French rescuers, was intercepted after getting into difficulty nearly seven miles (11km) north of Dunkirk. The migrants were taken to Calais.In the last year, the number of attempted crossings has soared despite repeated warnings from the French authorities and migrant support organisations of the danger in the Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, from traffic, strong currents and icy water.After meeting the British home secretary, Priti Patel, in August, the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said it was in both countries’ interests to stop “irregular crossings” of the Channel.The Home Office said patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed to deter crossings. It said it had sent back 125 illegal migrants who had arrived by sea in 2019 to show its “determination” to return those entering the country illegally to Europe where they should seek asylum.Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said France needed to do more to stop boats setting off from its coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce2277ef0b22f01ecc3d165afbb7c55408d2bf6/0_886_4222_2535/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43d0445e8bafe867e32ca3d700ab9b6","title":"mexico amlo el chapo same power past presidents corruption","story":"López Obrador took a blow at his predecessors while claiming Mexico’s era of corruption is ‘gone to the garbage dump of history’Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying the imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera had once wielded the same power as the country’s president.In a video message from the southern city of Palenque on Wednesday, López Obrador recounted his administration’s successes in its first year and highlighted its challenges foremost surging violence.He claimed without offering any evidence that he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past.“There was a time when Guzmán had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history,” López Obrador said.It appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexico’s former public safety secretary Genaro García Luna. García Luna was public safety secretary in Felipe Calderon’s Cabinet from 2006 to 2012. Before joining Calderon’s government, García Luna led Mexicos equivalent of the FBI, the Federal Investigative Agency, under Vicente Fox.He was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas.US prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference.Guzmán was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced this year to life in prison.López Obrador came to power a year ago promising a “hugs not bullets” approach of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on.But his vaguely defined strategy has itself come under intense criticism after a string of high-profile violent crimes, including an ambush which killed 13 state police officers, the murder of nine members of a US-Mexican family and the humiliating release of one of Guzmán’s sons after cartel gunmen besieged an entire city after he was briefly detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d98d1eec15c83c872ae75b942d840422e8ca7a9/0_119_4057_2434/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe16ea12a168d2f204362ac8ebac643b","title":"resurgent austrian greens in coalition deal with centre right party","story":"Sebastian Kurz, who leads the People’s party, can now return to power with small majorityAustria’s main centre-right party and the Greens have agreed on a coalition deal that will return ex-chancellor Sebastian Kurz to power.Both Kurz and Werner Kogler from the Greens, who led the negotiations between the two parties, told reporters in Vienna they had hammered out a government programme that would be presented to the public in detail on Thursday afternoon.“These were demanding negotiations, but the result is a very good one,” Kurz said. “Both us and the Greens will be able to honour the central election promises we made.”Kogler agreed, saying: “It wasn’t easy, but that’s also not what we were elected for.”“It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologise the tax system,” Kurz said, referring to the core campaign pledges of both parties and hinting at the deal’s contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.The 33-year-old Kurz’s People’s party embarked on negotiations with the Greens in mid-November, weeks after it emerged as by far the biggest party from the election. In the vote in September, the Greens, who had not previously been part of a federal government in Austria, saw their support soar and returned to parliament after a two-year absence.The two parties have a combined 97 seats in Austria’s 183-seat parliament. Kurz’s return to power would mean him taking back the title of the world’s youngest sitting head of government from the new Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who is 34. If the Green party’s delegates formally approve the coalition deal at their party convention on Saturday, the new government could be sworn in as early as next week.Kurz led a coalition with the Freedom party for 17 months until May, when a video showing then Freedom party leader Heinz-Christian Strache offering favours to a purported Russian investor prompted Kurz to pull the plug.Parliament then ousted Kurz in a no-confidence vote. Austria has since been run by a nonpartisan interim government under Chancellor Brigitte Bierlein.The Freedom party said after the election, in which it suffered significant losses, that it preferred to go into opposition to rebuild itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe6a59d17a4310cc27ff51e2d21046631f5e2c2/0_29_3178_1907/master/3178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=648aa3778a703e987633391914e15321","title":"can merkel and macron get franco german relations back on track","story":"As a year of big EU decisions begins, the bloc’s most important relationship is stuck in a rutIn early December, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel sat down opposite each other in Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant at the Savoy Hotel, central London, for a two-hour tête-à-tête dinner. They had some talking to do.Cordial and constructive, diplomats in Paris and Berlin said, the evening apparently cleared the air. But it will take more than a dinner to clear the structural obstacles to a relationship that is critical to what Europe can achieve in 2020.“The Franco-German relationship is the single most important relationship in the EU and it’s in a totally toxic condition,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “And it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”There was always going to be a yawning gulf between the styles of Macron, 41, an ambitious, impatient and at times arrogant first-time French president, and Merkel, a cautious, pragmatic, consensus-building fourth-time German chancellor. But if, on matters of substance, their overarching visions coincide more often than they erge, the two leaders’ very different domestic situations have compounded their personal differences, making the relationship unproductive – or worse.Macron, halfway through his mandate at the Élysée Palace and revelling in powers that are not far short of royal, is increasingly frustrated, not just with Merkel’s slow pragmatism, but with her weakened authority since announcing she would not run again when her term ends in 2021.Worse, her grand Christian Democrat-Social Democrat coalition is ided, bent mainly on survival and frightened even to consider fresh elections in which it would be challenged by the surging popularity of the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) on the right and the Greens on the left.“Germany is in political paralysis, incapable of taking a major decision, and will probably remain so until elections in September 2021,” said François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Hence Macron’s frustration: France has ideas Germany is sticking its fingers in its ears.”The makeup of Germany’s current coalition would anyway prove problematic for the French president, who himself faces re-election in 2022: the centre-left SPD dislikes his proposals on developing the EU’s military and security capability, while the conservative CDU opposes his plans for the eurozone and economic integration.“Macron basically bet the farm on building a new relationship with Germany, reforming France and working with Berlin to reform Europe,” Leonard said. “He appointed German-speaking ministers and spent his first year wooing the Germans – but nothing materialised. So he pivoted.”This year, Leonard said, the French president – currently trying to push through contested pension changes at home – has “not hung around for Berlin, or even shied away from upsetting it. His approach has been to launch his initiatives, try to build relationships with other countries, and involve the Germans later. It hasn’t gone down very well.”Others, too, have been annoyed by Macron’s tendency to act first and consult later: the French president has, often alone, insisted on a shorter article 50 extension imposed his line-up for Europe’s top jobs vetoed EU accession talks for North Macedonia and demanded, with the aim of keeping Russia out of China’s clutches, “a new architecture of trust and security” with Moscow.But Berlin in particular has been vexed, culminating – after Macron told the Economist that Nato was “brain dead” – in Merkel reportedly informing her French counterpart, at an anniversary dinner commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall, that she understood his “desire for disruptive politics” but was “tired of picking up the pieces”. Hence the Savoy dinner.The picture is not entirely bleak. Away from the headlines, steady, day-to-day bilateral work continues. Berlin and Paris are still pushing ahead where possible, albeit incrementally.German-French cooperation was “like two sides of an accordion”, a German diplomat said. “Sometimes you pull it apart a bit, then both sides come back together again. Each side knows they are joined to each other. And they know they can only produce a nice sound together.”The Franco-German relationship “is certainly not in crisis”, said Heisbourg. “But in a way, it would almost be better if it was, because then we would have a real discussion, and the chance of decisions and some substantive action.”Heisbourg added that Germany’s EU presidency, in the second half of the year, “for which Berlin surely will want to achieve something concrete”, might yet produce some progress. But Leonard was less sure.At root, he said, the problem was structural: most French voters think neither France nor Europe is working very well for them, so Macron has “no alternative but to be an agent of change and disruption” most Germans reckon things are going pretty well, so Merkel has the opposite imperative.“Why this matters,” Leonard said, “is because while it’s true that France and Germany can no longer set the EU agenda and just expect all the others to follow, if there is no consensus between Paris and Berlin, really, nothing is possible.”Ever since the 1950s, the relationship between France and Germany, the continent’s economic powerhouse and its diplomatic and military leader, has been the EU’s engine: when it works, Europe moves forward when it doesn’t, Europe stalls.The EU’s big decisions in 2020 – its new budget, eurozone reforms, carbon neutrality, digital taxation, relations with Russia – would be difficult even if France and Germany could agree and were prepared to act, Leonard said. “If they can’t and they’re not, it’s going to be very, very difficult indeed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a277d5a506700e484d4a86c7c27ac7f446c36f46/996_370_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8abc8789c761d321b859cec40de61fa","title":"carlos ghosn prepares to speak as japan comes to terms with saviour who fled","story":"Wife dismisses reports husband escaped inside an instrument case as world awaits full explanation from fugitiveThe world will have to wait until next week for what could be the only definitive account of how Carlos Ghosn managed to leave Japan months before he was due to stand trial for alleged financial misconduct.The former Nissan chairman who fled the country to Lebanon while out on bail, will speak to the media in Beirut next Wednesday, media reports said, in a public appearance that could provide answers to myriad questions swirling around his daring escape.Few countries will be monitoring Ghosn’s comments more closely than Japan, where his work to turn around Nissan earned him something of a saviour image. The official response in Japan has been a mixture of condemnation – including by his own lawyers – and disbelief that a high-profile suspect under strictly monitored house arrest could have fled overseas, apparently without a passport.Ghosn was carrying one of his two French passports when he left Japan, according to a Japanese media report. Public broadcaster NHK said the court had allowed him to keep a second French passport as long as it was kept “in a locked case” with the key held by his lawyers.The most widely circulated account of his escape – that he was carried out of his Tokyo residence in a wooden case for a musical instrument and spirited out of the country on a private jet from Kansai International airport in western Japan – has been challenged by Carole Ghosn.She described the account as “fiction” on Wednesday, but declined to provide details of her husband’s exit.On Thursday Turkish police detained several people after the interior ministry launched a probe into the transit of Ghosn through the country, according to broadcaster NTV.Japan’s government has yet to publicly comment on Ghosn’s escape, news of which broke as millions of people left Tokyo and other major cities to spend the New Year holidays in their home towns.“When I saw the news I thought, if you have the money you can do anything you like,” said Chiaki Kurimoto, a part-time worker in Osaka . “It’s just like a spy movie. I still can’t come to terms with how he managed to get out of Japan like that. He made the security authorities look silly.“I’d been following Ghosn’s struggle with his former Nissan colleagues and was looking forward to seeing how it played out, but his escape means the story has ended prematurely.”Rui Morimoto, a 20-year-old university student, said he was disappointed that the man credited with rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy two decades ago had decided to flee. “Ghosn said he had done nothing wrong and was seen as a business hero, so he should have taken on his accusers fair and square in court.”While some sections of the Japanese media had expressed sympathy with Ghosn over his long detention before he was released on bail for a second time last year, newspapers were united in their condemnation of the former auto executive’s latest actions.“Running away is a cowardly act that mocks Japan’s justice system,” said the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun – a sentiment shared by the liberal Tokyo Shimbun.Masahisa Sato, an MP from the ruling Liberal Democratic party, described Ghosn’s actions as “an illegal departure and an escape, and this itself is a crime. Was there help extended by an unnamed country? It is also a serious problem that Japan’s system allowed an illegal departure so easily.”The filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda acknowledged that Ghosn had broken the law by skipping bail, but said in a tweet: “Many people are reluctant to blame him, probably because the arbitrary and unfair application of the law under the Abe administration has become a norm.” Soda added the episode was proof that the rule of law in Japan “is in crisis”.Masaru Kaneko, an emeritus professor at Keio University, suggested double standards had been at work in Ghosn’s treatment, contrasting his arrest and long detention with the decision not to take action against Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a high-profile TV journalist who is close to Abe’s administration, over allegations that he raped reporter Shiori Ito. Yamaguchi has consistently denied the allegations, although Ito won damages in a civil lawsuit last month.The Lebanese presidency on Thursday denied reports that President Michel Aoun had welcomed Ghosn upon his arrival in the country.Reuters repeated claims made by the Wall Street Journal that the plan to get Ghosn out of Japan had been three months in the making.“It was a very professional operation from start to finish,” one of the sources said, adding that Ghosn had thanked Aoun for the support he had given him and his wife Carole while he was in detention.It is unclear how much Ghosn, who has remained silent since releasing a statement on New Year’s Eve, will reveal when he speaks to the media on 8 January, a year to the day since he proclaimed his innocence in his first public appearance since his arrest in November 2018.He is likely to be come under pressure to offer a full account of the circumstances behind his arrival in Lebanon on Monday morning, but is reportedly unwilling to share details of his escape to protect people who helped him in Japan.Ghosn, who is of Lebanese origin and holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian passports, insisted in the statement he had not fled justice after being charged with underreporting his income, transferring Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest and other charges for which he faced up to 15 years in prison.“I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied, in flagrant disregard of Japan’s legal obligations under international law and treaties it is bound to uphold,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe113cbb9b8818c66906bdf8f2f3671072a9e17/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976805de80d77553ff9268b1aa57205c","title":"turkish parliament to vote on sending troops to libya","story":"Lawmakers expected to approve action to back UN-supported Tripoli governmentTurkey’s parliament is to vote on Thursday on whether to send troops to Libya to back the UN-supported government in Tripoli in its fight against forces loyal to a rival administration in eastern Libya seeking to capture the capital.Lawmakers are expected to approve the motion at the emergency session called for later in the day, and grant a one-year mandate for the deployment, despite concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate Libya’s conflict further and destabilise the region.The Tripoli-based government of the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, has faced an offensive by the rival, east-based government and commander Gen Khalifa Haftar. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violence rivalling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said last month that Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment, after they signed a military deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has drawn ire across the region and beyond.Details of the possible Turkish deployment have not been revealed. The motion to be debated in parliament allows the government to decide on its scope, size and timing.Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.Turkey’s main opposition party has made clear it will vote against the motion, saying it would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the “shedding of Muslims’ blood”. It has called on Erdoğan’s government to search for a diplomatic solution in Libya instead.However, Erdoğan’s ruling party is in an alliance with a nationalist party and the two hold sufficient votes for the motion to pass.The fighting around Tripoli escalated in recent weeks after Haftar declared a “final” and decisive battle for the capital. He has the backing of the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia, while the Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

Stock photograph: Paul FaithPA. Talks aimed at restoring Northern Ireland’s devolved government are to resume at Stormont on Thursday with less than two weeks for the parties to reach a deal or face fresh Assembly elections. Each of Northern Ireland’s five main parties will participate in bilateral discussions with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Mr Coveney travelled to Belfast on Wednesday for a meeting with Mr Smith ahead of the resumption of formal discussions. He also held informal meetings with several of the North’s political parties. Mr Coveney said on social media that this year could be “a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership and generosity from all sides”. In a New Year’s Day video posted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney said that “we are determined to work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to get the devolved government back up and running again, to get the institutions of the Good Friday agreement functioning again, to bring communities together and to ensure that Northern Ireland can make decisions for itself”. Northern Ireland has been without a powersharing government at Stormont since January 2017, when the Assembly collapsed following a controversy over a botched renewable heating scheme. The legislation which gives civil servants the power to keep Northern Ireland running in the absence of a devolved government expires on January 13th. Mr Smith has said the parties must reach a deal by then or he will call an election. The latest round of talks on restoring Stormont ended without agreement before Christmas, with both Mr Coveney and Mr Smith blaming the DUP for scuppering the chances of a deal, a charge the DUP “flatly rejected”. What are the stumbling blocks?The outstanding issues are said by all parties to be “on the margins”, and relate to matters such as an Irish language Act, the sustainability of any reformed Stormont, and reform of the petition of concern – a vetoing system that allows parties which have 30 signatures to block motions even if these motions have majority support.DUP leader Arlene Foster said that as the talks recommence “we will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home, but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised.” Over the Christmas period each of the parties has spoken of their determination to see agreement reached and Stormont restored. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the outstanding issues could be resolved and “the choice is now for agreement, or elections. But the current situation cannot continue.” In his homily on New Year’s Day, Bishop of Down and Connor Noel Treanor said: “We await and expect in the coming days what Pope Francis’s message describes as a renewal of political will, so that new ways can be found to reconcile and unite iniduals and communities.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128700.1577953811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney says endgame is on as stormont talks enter final days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney  has warned that agreement on the restoration of power sharing in Stormont must be reached in the coming days.

Photograph:  Jonathan BradyPA Wire Keir Starmer has emerged as an early frontrunner in the Labour Party leadership race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn after a poll of members suggested he was the first choice in all regions of the UK, age groups and social classes.The shadow Brexit secretary is yet to formally launch his campaign but is expected to do so in the first few weeks of the new year. The new leader will be elected in March after Mr Corbyn said he would step down following the party’s catastrophic general election defeat.Polling by YouGov for the Party Members Project put Mr Starmer as winning with a 61 per cent vote share to 39 per cent for the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, in the last round.Jess Phillips, the chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, who has yet to declare if she is running, was the third most popular choice among members, who were surveyed between December 20th and 30th.The results at this preliminary stage suggest that the winner is unlikely to come from the left of the party, according to Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, who jointly ran the poll with the University of Sussex.“This is not shaping up to be a 2015-style Labour leadership contest. Unless potential candidates drop out before the start of voting, it may take a few rounds to decide the winner this time around.“But it doesn’t look at the moment as if the winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory,” he said.So far only the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have officially said they want to run to be the next Labour leader.Ms Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, are expected to stand while the former Labour minister and home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, is understood to be weighing up her options as to whether she will vie for the leadership for a second time.Mineworkers’ unionThe party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery – who lambasted the party’s performance for their muddled stance on Brexit – might also run. A former National Union of Mineworkers chair who supports leaving the EU, he would be the most left-wing of all the potential candidates.The poll will be interesting reading for all those who said they were using the Christmas break to decide whether to launch official campaigns and gain the signatures of MPs needed to get on the ballot.In the survey of 1,059 Labour party members, 31 per cent put Mr Starmer as their first-choice candidate, 20 per cent backed Ms Long Bailey as their favourite, Ms Phillips received 11 per cent and Mr Lewis and Ms Cooper were the first choice for 7 per cent of surveyed members. Ms Thornberry was on 6 per cent and Ms Nandy was on 5 per cent.With the “don’t knows” removed from the survey and numbers put through a simulated leadership vote, Prof Bale and Prof Paul Webb of the University of Sussex found Mr Starmer beat Ms Long Bailey in the last round by 61 per cent to 39 per cent.In the simulation, Ms Phillips was knocked out in the penultimate round with 18 per cent of the vote. Ms Cooper made it through to the fourth round. Ms Nandy and Ms Thornberry were the first to be knocked out.The Leave-Remain split may impact on the eventual vote as Ms Long Bailey is ranked first by just 19 per cent of Labour members who voted Remain in 2016 but by 31 per cent of those who voted leave.Ms Starmer, on the other hand, is ranked first by only 17 per cent of leavers but by 34 per cent of remainers. The majority of party members are remainers, which may work in his favour in an actual vote.There is little difference between the popularity of the candidates between men and women, although Ms Long Bailey is fractionally more popular among male members.“It certainly doesn’t look as if Labour’s members are necessarily persuaded that it’s time the party had a female leader. They seem more interested in picking the best person for the job, irrespective of gender,” said Bale, who co-wrote Footsoldiers: Political Party Membership in the 21st century with Webb and Monica Poletti. Over-60sMr Starmer is also shown in the survey to be more popular than Ms Long Bailey in all age groups but particularly with those aged over 60. He also was more popular with middle-class members by 14 percentage points over Ms Long Bailey.Much of the reflection among members after the election has been on whether Labour needs someone from the north of England to reconnect to voters in former heartland seats that fell to the Tories.However, the most northern of all the MPs – Lisa Nandy – does not seem any more popular among Labour members living in the north than with those in other UK regions.Labour’s northern members seem to be just as keen as members from other parts of the country on Mr Starmer, who represents Holborn and St Pancras in north London.Scottish members were shown to much prefer Mr Starmer to Ms Long Bailey, who polled at 11 per cent compared with Mr Starmer’s 42 per cent.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask. Now I will have to.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.The best dresses of the decade Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Actor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement. OPPaul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film Phantom Thread, centres on fictional fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love affair with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps).SYYes, you read that right.

OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus. When Jodie Comer stomped across our screens in Killing Eve wearing Balenciaga biker boots and Molly Goddard’s frothy pink dress, it turned the British designer into a household name. OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.  SY4950 2 - The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding dress, Alexander McQueen, 2011Kate Middleton and Prince William\u0027s wedding on 29 April 2011 included many memorable moments but no detail has stood the test of time quite like the duchess’s iconic wedding dress. SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black. SYAll things considered, then, I presumed this pledge would be easy. I’d finally kick my \u0026amp Other Stories habit, something that might harm\u0026nbspthe planet as much as it harms my wallet, and enjoy the feeling of knowing I’ll be making better, more sustainable sartorial choices. But having given this some thought, I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about waving goodbye to the ease and accessibility that high street shopping allows. What if I ladder my tights at work? Or forget to pack a second pair of underwear for after my lunchtime gym session? Such issues arise – all too often for me – and it’s arguably easiest to solve them by heading to the nearest high street shop, which, let’s face it, is probably not going to sell eco-friendly lingerie.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2008 this share was just 38 per cent.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

(FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph.

In comments made at the World Economic Forum in Davos\u0026nbspearlier this year, Mr Benioff\u0026nbspdescribed Facebook as “addictive, not good for you” and warned that “they’re after your kids”.Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment but chief executive\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg has consistently rejected calls for the company he founded in 2004 to be broken up.In leaked audio from an internal meeting earlier this year, Mr Zuckerberg claimed\u0026nbsphe would sue the government if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren fulfilled her election promise to break up Big Tech companies.Facebook apps account for nearly half of all child abuse reportsHe told employees that Facebook would put forward a legal challenge, adding:\u0026nbsp“I would bet that we will win.”He said: “Look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”Ms Warren responded in a tweet: “Would would really ‘suck’ is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

In 2008 this share was just 38 per cent.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I genuinely believe that he was, but on the biggest political crisis of British modern politics we were unable, via Jeremy, to be able to take a position.Watson says ‘brutality’ within Labour behind reason he quit“I think actually we should have stood our ground and argued our case.”The stance is in marked contrast to that of the other leadership candidates, including Rebecca Long Bailey, who finally broke her silence to confirm she plans to run.The shadow business secretary criticised the party’s Brexit position, saying “our compromise solution satisfied too few”, but she did not set out what the party should have done instead.Mr Lewis said that his personal experience on the doorstep had shown him that Mr Corbyn’s leadership was a problem for many voters.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto.

He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Stormzy responded by branding Wiley a “pr**k” and claiming that Wiley’s anger was at odds with the direct messages he had sent.\u0026nbsp“OK I actually think you do crack coz you dm’d me yesterday saying ‘bro omg let’s build houses in Ghana for our mums’ and now you’re here moving mad,” Stormzy tweeted.“You are a pr**k coz you dm me all the time like it’s mad love and we’re brothers and then you come on the internet and act weird and the reason that makes you a prick is because you know I won’t ever say anything on the TL because arguing on the net has never been my style,” he added.Wiley then responded: “You ain’t ready for smoke mike your a star go be a star and mind ya own bizness on this 1.”Stormzy lashes out at media for ‘intentionally spinning’ his words Harry Styles chants ‘f*** Boris’ as Stormzy joins him on stageStormzy’s second album heralds a man who knows exactly who he isAfter a continued back-and-forth, Stormzy dismissed Wiley’s suggestion that the pair meet to work out their differences.“Shut up man no one wants to link you you dinosaur lol,” he said.He added: “I love you so much but you are so annoying.”Many fans pointed out Wiley’s hypocrisy for mocking Stormzy’s Sheeran collaboration, given Wiley also teamed up with the singer-songwriter for the track “You”, from Sheeran’s 2011 EP No 5 Collaborations Project.Stormzy is currently on course to score the first number one of the decade with “Own It”, against Lewis Capaldi’s “Before You Go” and Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now”.Heavy is the Head\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It took all that time as well as a variety of different investigative techniques – from the latest DNA profiling to more traditional documents – for investigators to find out his identity, and finally inform a surviving relative about what happened.The mystery over the torso began in 1979. A family who were going through Buffalo Cave in the hope of finding arrow heads came across human remains, wrapped in burlap and buried beneath the ground. For a long time after that, nothing new was found.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Matt Roberts reacts to seeing his sister\u0027s house destroyed by a bushfire in Quaama, New South Wales, AustraliaA man rides a donkey cart against the last setting sun of 2019 in Lahore, PakistanA Skycrane drops water on a bushfire in Bundoora, Melbourne, Australia.

In his televised address, Aoun proposed a government that includes both technocrats and politiciansThen, in 1991, another person going through the same cave system found a mummified hand, and further searches found an arm and two legs that had also been wrapped up and put inside the cave. That was the last that investigators would find in the cave, despite intense efforts from organisations including the FBI.Scientists were able to find some information about the man whose body had been discovered, including the fact that his body could have been there for 10 or more years. Though they could tell the body had been cut apart using tools, there was no way of knowing what had killed him.Researchers then turned to DNA techniques in an attempt to find the identity of the body. Local authorities sought the help of the DNA Doe Project, which seeks to use scientific testing to find the identity of remains so they can be returned to their families.Man executed 13 years ago may be proven innocent by DNAThat turned up much more information about the man, including that his relatives arrived in Utah with\u0026nbspthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His probably grandfather had four wives, and so the man had a vast number of relatives, researcher\u0026nbspLee Bingham Redgrave told the Associated Press.By searching through a variety of candidates – and discovering a number of strange facts, such as the fact that a grave belonging to\u0026nbspJoseph Henry Loveless didn\u0027t actually include his body – researchers were able to find their candidate. They discovered through archive research that he was accused of killing his second wife, and that though he was sent to prison for the crime he was experienced at breaking out of jail, and did.Investigators think he died soon after breaking out, in 1916. They still don\u0027t know how, or why his body came to be placed in the cave, but hope that keeping the case open could lead to further clues about what happened to him.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all. That all changed at pm on December .Boris Johnson’s thumping election win gives us the greatest opportunity for radical renewal since at least .That means finally achieving Brexit  days from now and then, we hope, rapidly ­striking trade deals with Brussels and the world’s greatest economies.It means a dramatic, imaginative ­Budget to turbo-charge both those “left-behind” regions which voted Tory for the first time and the wider economy.We share too the  vision of our readers: For huge NHS investment to continue and a long-term social care solution be put in place.That tax breaks and rate cuts must renew our dilapidated High Streets and help small firms thrive and create jobs.That rough sleeping must be slashed, even ended. That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting. Instead we need grown-up debate.The answer to the climate crisis isn’t to criticise each other — it’s to work together to make real change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need contact — and not just emotional — but physical.There’s even a psychological term for it, skin hunger.People are responding to this tech-driven disconnect by seeking out physical contact in any way they can.The most obvious example is the rise of hugging.There’s a lot more hugging as a greeting between men than there used to be, even between sporting opponents.And what on earth happened to the stand-offish Brits  Great British Bake Off contestants spend nearly as much time holding hands and wrapping their arms around each other as they do baking.We have become so hungry for touch that we don’t even need a human partner.The odds are that someone you know will have received a weighted blanket for Christmas.It is essentially a duvet cover filled with plastic or glass pellets or beads.Manufacturers say the even pressure they exert on your body promotes the release of well-being chemical serotonin and sleep hormone melatonin, while reducing stress-related hormone cortisol.In plain language we’re talking about feeling the comfort and security of being cradled, evenit’s by a blanket rather than in the arms of a loved one.For those who want to take the experience of being hugged to a whole new level, Otonamaki, the Japanese practice of adult swaddling, will become popular in .After getting into a foetal position, the client is bound tightly in sheets, then gently rocked for  minutes.I ran across a tweet not long ago that read: “My phone just said, ‘Welcome home’, and I instinctively replied, ‘I love you’.

This would result in a final round in which bookies’ favourite Sir Keir would beat Ms Long Bailey, seen as the continuity Corbyn candidate, by % to %. Labour moderate Jess Phillips would come third on %, followed by Yvette Cooper and Clive Lewis on %, Emily Thornberry on % and Lisa Nandy on %. The poll suggests Sir Keir would beat the shadow business secretary in every age group, region and among men and women, but not among those who voted Leave in . The pair were also neck-and-neck among working-class members. The majority of Labour members backed Remain and Sir Keir has been seen as a strong voice for them around the shadow cabinet table.  However, his close association with Remain will have faded by the time of the next election, when Labour will have to win back thousands of Leave voters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorthern Ireland powersharing talks resumed this morning, in a bid to restore devolved government in the region.The latest process, which was initiated in the wake of the general election , was paused over the festive period after a pre-Christmas deal failed to materialise.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions. On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Irelandaposs struggling public services expires and Secretary of State Julian Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election. The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal. The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be bounced into a quick fix that falls apart when tested. Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein - the regionaposs two largest parties - agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast. The other three main parties - the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance - are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish governments. While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition. Expectations of a breakthrough rose after the DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results in the general election. With many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the partiesapos failure to do a deal, stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in December. However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced. The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down. Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations. The Stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the UK government on a financial package to accompany theof devolution - money that would likely be targeted at the regionaposs crisis-hit health service.  Irelandaposs deputy premier Simon Coveney and Mr Smith were in Belfast on New Yearaposs Day for pre-talks discussions ahead of the resumption of formal exchanges with the political parties. Mr Coveney urged the parties to show leadership and generosity. He said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again. The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective new year messages to restate a desire toto government. DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party stood ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised, she said. While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a wasted decade, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach. But the republican leader added: There is no contradiction in working for Irish unity and working for the restoration of the Executive and Assembly - they are all part of the Good Friday Agreement. The outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.

Tipping the scales at st lb, Julie ­struggled to do any basic activity.

After hitting her target weight on Christmas Eve  – st lb – she got a touching message from her mother’s friend, Helen, to tell her how proud she was – and how worried her mother had been.

But it wasn’t until she met her husband John, now , in April , that she really began to pile on the pounds.  She says: “We’d have nights in with ­takeaways, go out for meals or have friends over and snack on crisps and wine.” The couple married in June . However, in the three years they had been together, Julie, who is ft in, had gone from a size  to a size .

She says: “When Mum moved into a hospice in August , I’d grab breakfast on the run so I could be with her, then we’d have tea and cake in the day. It became easier to grab a McDonald’s when I headed home. And rather than eating a balanced diet, I just ate rubbish.” Vera passed away in November , but Julie’s weight continued to spiral, and she was soon a size . “I could barely walk up the stairs without getting out of breath and did absolutely no exercise,” she explains. “So, when my sisters joined Slimming World in January , I went too because I didn’t want to miss out!” And soon she saw a huge dference. “I started to think more about what I was putting in my body” Julie says. “Instead of grabbing the easiest thing, like a jar of sauce to chuck on some spaghetti, I’d make it and know what ingredients I was putting in.

In the decade since , fares for commuters have risen by %. But the average weekly wage has only risen %, according to a TUC analysis of official figures. The shocking revelation by the TUC comes as commuters ing to work today have been hit with a .% rail fares rise. And the trade union body says the increase cannot be justied when the private rail companies have paid out more than £.billion in idends to shareholders in the past five years. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Working people have had enough of over-crowded and unreliable services. “The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders. “No more excuses - the government must end the failed privatisation and put trains back in public ownership. This would free up money for much-needed upgrades and lower ticket prices for working people.” Some British commuters are spending seven times as much on train season tickets as counterparts in Europe. TUC research also shows someone on an average salary travelling from Chelmsford in Essex to London will have to fork out % of their pay for season tickets . But comparable commutes would cost a mere % of the average salary in France, and % in Germany and Belgium. Pressure group the Campaign for Better Transport is pressing for a full reform of the rail fares system. Darren Shirley, CBT chief executive, said: “Rail passengers are tired of rising fares and broken promises. “Only total reform will start to restore passengers’ faith in the rail network, and ensure the railways are more affordable and better value for passengers.” The Government sets the January fare increase using July’s Retail Price Indexlevel - which critics say is a discredited and out-dated statistic. If the more appropriate Consumer Price Indexhad been used to set fare increases, regulated fares - including season tickets and standard s - would have risen by .% today, according to the CBT. Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions for industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: “We know that no-one wants to pay more to travel, and rail companies have, for the third year in a row, held average fare increases below inflation while continuing to deliver investment in new trains and extra services that will improve journeys for customers.  “In , we will work together to run , extra services a week and roll out , more train carriages as we replace half the country’s train carriages. “We will also continue to push for changes to regulations that would make rail fares match how people work today and tackle crowding on the busiest long-distance routes.” The Department for Transportis expected to publish a white paper based on the findings of the Rail Review in the coming weeks. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy Mcdonald said: “Today’s average fare increase of .% means ticket prices have risen by % since . It shows that this government is not serious about supporting either public transport or tackling climate change, road congestion or air quality.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le.

Whitney Chardoulias, , her husband Andrew, , who have six kids between them, have travelled across nine states and covered ,-mile in the six months since leaving their home in Muscatine, Iowa, in the US. The couple, who are owners of dog breeding business, Cedar Bend Labradoodles, spent ,on renovating the -foot bus and splashed out ,on a new engine. Their impressive converted home includes a kitchen, living room, toy room, bathroom with a tub, king size bed and three bunk beds Whitney was inspired to go on the trip by families she saw on Instagram who had converted school buses and travelled the country. When Whitney told Andrew about the idea  he was quickly convinced it was a good thing to do and they started planning their trip right away. Among the states the couple and their kids have visited are Colorado, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky and Indiana, Whitney said: Quincy was two we spent four and half months in Biloxi, Mississippi. I grew up inland in Muscatine, Iowa, and never really saw the ocean or a beach before. Our place was right by the beach and I loved it so much and dreaded coming home,” Whitney said. “I had seen other families on Instagram living in a converted bus and travelling the country and I was so envious. I remember telling Andrew I didn’t want to be old and grey and wishing we had travelled more. I told him about the busses and asked him ‘why not us ’  “He bought the idea and when we told friends and family, they were against it at first. My mum was especially convinced that our kids would be kidnapped or mauled by bears. They have all come around to it now though and our friends think it’s really cool. When not travelling, the bus sits on land at Whitney’s parents’ farm. During the day the couple work on their dog breeding business while the children attend school, but next year the couple are hoping to start home schooling so that they can travel more frequently. Due to cold nights the family are now temporarily all sleeping in the farmhouse at night while sorting out the insulation on their bus, but as soon as that is fixed they intend to get back on the bus full time.  Their converted home includes a full kitchen, living room, toy room, bathroom with a tub, king size bed and three bunks. There is also extra sleeping space on a sofa that opens into a double bed. Due to cold nights the family are now temporarily all sleeping in the farmhouse at night while the couple improve the insulation on their bus, but as soon as that is fixed they intend to get back on the bus full time. The  couples four kids Quincy, seven, Fletcher, four, Rowe, two and River, one have joined them for all of the trip.  Andrew has two other children with a dferent mother Brenna, , and Bria, , who travel with them on some of their adventures. Whitney said: “Our kids have been excited every step of the way and we’ve covered more than , miles now across the states of Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky and Indiana, “The kids are at school during the daytime and me and Andrew both work on our dog raising business and helping maintain the farm. “The best thing about this journey is travelling and seeing our children experience new things. Every time we get back ‘home’ they ask us when we are leaving again. Also I love only having to clean  sq. feet each day, though I must admit I don’t enjoy doing the kids bunks. “For a large family it’s been very good for our budget too and I would guess that we spend only around £,a month.

the s, Tele Sport writers George Cran and Calum Woodger looked back over the decade and, after a debate on the Twa Teams, One Street podcast, brought together the EveningTeam of the Decade.Goalkeeper: Scott BainArriving at Dens Park a year before the club won the Championship, Bain made himself club No  in the Premiership.After  appearances for the club, Bain left for Celtic and has played three times for Scotland.Defence: Gary IrvineA favourite among Dundee fans who crowned Irvine ‘the White Cafu’ after a flurry of goals from right-back, the defender made almost  appearances for the club.Defenders: Sean DillonA modern day club legend, ‘Dillo’ spent more than  years at Dundee United, winning the Scottish Cup in .He went on to captain the club for four seasons in the top-flight before departing in  after making  appearances in tangerine.James McPakeDillon and McPake shook hands six times as captains in Dundee derbies, with the United man getting the better of the results.McPake, though, is remembered as a player for two derby goals – one in a - win for his side and the second a late leveller at Tannadice.He may only have made  appearances for the club before injury ended his career early but McPake’s leadership on the pitch earns him a place in this team.Andrew RobertsonVery little has to be said about this choice – Robertson was a star in the making at Tannadice.Arriving as an unknown -year-old from Queen’s Park, Robertson swtly made the left-back place his own and became well-known for rampaging runs down the flank.Just a year later, he was off to Hull City for £. million and has since become a European Cup winner with Liverpool and Scotland captain.His  games for United brought five goals.Midfielders:Gary Mackay-StevenThe wing wizard edged out Dundee favourite Gary Harkins for the right-wing berth in our team.‘GMS’ was an entertainer with an array of tricks and flicks and was a major part of the free-flowing football that made the Tangerines a regular top-six outfit under Jackie McNamara.Stuart ArmstrongArmstrong and ‘GMS’ were inseparable at the top end of Scottish football for years before the former moved down south to Southampton.Armstrong’s athleticism and ability on the ball made him the focal point of United’s attack during six years at the club from  to .Kevin ThomsonHe may only have played  times for the Dens Park club.However, Thomson’s ability and nous in the middle of the park played a huge role in Dundee’s top-six finish in -.Craig ConwayA man scoring two goals in a Scottish Cup Final win is a must for

arguably Dundee’s Player of the Decade.Shortlisted for the - PFA Scotland Players’ Player of the Year award, Stewart terrorised Premiership defences in dark blue.Twenty-two league goals in  top-flight matches from his time at the club is a sizeablewith his trademark curled finishes a regular sight at Dens Park.Jon DalyAnother Scottish Cup winner in his time in the city, Daly was a colossus for Dundee United.A real targetman, Daly was key in the early part of the decade with - a bumper year with  league goals in the top flight after winning the Scottish Cup in .The Irishman managed  goals in

can see James McPake’s frustration that Dundee didn’t win on Friday night but the - draw at Tannadice showed exactly why Dundee United are where they are.The Dark Blues probably were the better team in the end and they’ll take plenty of positives out of it but it was a good result for the Tangerines, too.I agree with manager Robbie Neilson saying his side didn’t play as well as they could have.For some reason, they looked a bit anxious and nervy in the second half which is completely unlike them.United had done so well in the previous derbies and been so assured it was a surprise to see them just lump the ball forward as the game wore on.However, the sign of a title-winning team is they can still take a point despite not playing well against one of the better sides in the ision.And they even extended their lead at the top as, once more, the other sides failed to take advantage of United dropping points.For James and his side, they were far better than previous derby showings, that much is obvious.It was a step forward for them and will give their fans a positive jolt heading into the new year.I still think they have problems creating chances.They had lots of good play in the second half but still can’t convert that into clear-cut opportunities.Look at the stats and, though Dundee about edged the game for me, United still had more shots on goal.I do think the way the Dens gaffer has set up his team recently suits them better and that showed on Friday night.There’s more balance in the midfield with Fin Robertson and Graham Dorrans taking turns to control things in the middle.It’s taken a while, which is understandable given the big changes in the summer, but James is starting to find a good formation and his best starting XI.These things always take time but it seems like the Dee are getting there.The key is they kick on from here.For United, it’s about ticking over and keeping themselves well clear of any trouble at the top.Sounds like there were a fair few interested parties at the derby, no doubt taking a look at Lawrence Shankland after his goalscoring exploits this season.It wouldn’t surprise methose English clubs were keeping an eye on Robertson and Dorrans either, the way those two are performing."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/19746762-907x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 1 1

dominance.Nicky Clark had given league leaders United an early advantage but Dorrans rled home the equaliser in the second period to end the Terrors# nine-game winning streak and perfect derby record this season.Dundee were unchanged from their win over Partick last weekend while Louis Appere replaced the injured Sam Stanton for United.And it was the Tangerines who got off to a dream start in front of a , near-sell-out, scoring with the first attack and shot of the game after just five minutes.Appere released Jamie Robson on the overlap down the left and the full-back#s delivery was flicked home by Clark for his seventh goal of the season.Action threatened to boil over on  minutes as Robson and Dundee#s Paul McGowan exchanged handbags in the corner but referee Alan Muir kept his cards in his pocket.And it was McGowan who had the Dark Blues# first real chance of the game on  minutes.The -year-old picked up on a Jordan Marshall cut back, twisted and turned in the box to make some space but saw his shot deflected behind for a corner.On  minutes McGowan was again denied by Siegrist inside the box as he collected a lovely reverse pass from -year-old Fin Robertson but couldn#t find a way past the big Swiss.Terrors talisman Lawrence Shankland had his first clear-cut chance of the game  minutes before half-time but couldn#t head home from six yards out after Robson#s delivery.Calum Butcher escaped a booking on two counts as he went in heavy on Danny Johnson and McGowan as tempers began to flare as the game approached half-time.Dee keeper Jack Hamilton did well to deny Ian Harkes from close range to keep the score down at the interval.Much like the opening period, there was an early goal to start the second half # and it was Dundee who got it.Five minutes after the action restarted Dorrans got on the end of Liam Smith#s clearance to rle home a left-footed volley for his first goal for the club.With the match level, the Dark Blues almost took the lead moments later as Johnson was inches away from getting on the end of a Sean Mackie cross.On  minutes, Shankland went close as he nodded Paul McMullan#s cross just wide of Hamilton#s left-hand post as both teams pushed for a winner.However, both sides had to settle for a point apiece as they go into the new year United sitting top and Dundee in play-off contention.Dundee United XI : SiegristL Smith,

Park Rangers, Norwich City, Brentford, Everton and Rangers, were in attendance at Tannadice for last Friday’s - derby draw against Dundee.The main focus was on talisman Lawrence Shankland, who has been linked with QPR and Norwich, with young forward Louis Appere also reportedly a Canaries target.The -year-old broke into the Scotland squad this season, netting during a tie against San Marino .Boss Robbie is pleased they are attracting interest because it means they are performing well – and threw goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist and defenders Liam Smith and Jamie Robson into the same bracket.However, the United boss was keen to stress their desire to hold onto key men for their final push towards promotion.He said: “I would expect there to be interest in a number of our players because a lot of them have done very well this season.#Lawrence is the obvious one because of his goals but the two young full-backs have done really well and the goalie has been outstanding, too.“So I would imagine a number of clubs and other managers have been watching us.“The chairman has stated all along that the most important thing is to be promoted so we can’t afford to be making too many changes in January.”Robbie, however, conceded that everyone has their pricetheir resolve is tested.He added: “Obviously in football, everyone has their price and clubs are selling clubs – even Celtic and Rangers fall into that bracket.“That’s the business model of every club in Scotland, you give players the  to play.“Everyone’s got their price but the price of going up would outweigh what we’d get you’d imagine.“There is pressure on players because of people watching them and speculation but you have to handle that as a footballer.“I’d rather have that than sitting down the bottom of the table and having that negativity.”Meanwhile, Robbie has dismissed reports they are interested in bringing St Mirren’s Stephen McGinn to

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication. Itrsquos about not realising that yoursquore actually on the same page as someone and how a misperception can drive you apart. However, itrsquos also about realising this and rebuilding bridges,\" Duncan says. Wuh Oh - Pretty Boy Glasgow-producer Wuh Oh, aka Peter Ferguson teams up with Hudson Mohawke for a mindblowingly original classical meets post-electro music with cellos and xylophones thrown in for good measure.\"One day something in my brain exploded and it was asI could suddenly see what made the chord progressions and melodies work. I got mega obsessed with harmony and since then Irsquove never stopped searching for magic note combinations I donrsquot understand yet: those greeny-purple chords,\" Ferguson says.

Edinburghrsquos Hogmanayrsquos city-wide series of site-specic installations combines newly commissioned texts by five writers with new visual projections and sound scores. The event is run in partnership by Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers, Underbelly in association with Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh International Book Festival.It follows on from last yearrsquos Love Letters to Europe-themed compendium of works, and opened yesterday to usher in Scotlandrsquos Year of Coasts and Waters under the banner of Shorelines, with work that focuses on Edinburghrsquos maritime history in radically dferent ways.Sugar for Your Tea, takes place at the City Chambers on High Street, and sees its author reflect on the darker side of Scotlandrsquos sea-faring past. Using video and projections, Bankole focuses on the seemingly respectable Scottish merchants and businessmen whose names remain familiar from streets and statues across the country, but who made their fortunes on the back of the slave trade.Filmed by Rianne White, who has previously made videos for Young Fathers, The Proclaimers and Kate Tempest, Sugar for Your Tea also sees Bankole perform his text onscreen through a backdrop of light and water to reflect on his own identity as a Scot, as well as honouring his Nigerian ancestors. With the words themselves projected onto the City Chambers by high-tech projection mapping company, Double Take Projections, Bankole has also provided a new soundscape for the event.ldquoI didnrsquot know about Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, says Bankole. ldquoThings like that are always buried under the crypt, so this piece actually came from being a human making new discoveries. Irsquom not pointing the finger. Irsquom wanting to make people consider how we have appropriate discussions about identity and move forward.As those who have already trawled across the city yesterday will know, as well as Bankolersquos work, the Shorelines edition of Message from the Skies will feature new writing by Kathleen Jamie, Robin Robertson, Charlotte Runcie and Irvine Welsh. These map the city from the Union Canal in Fountainbridge to the Malmaison hotel on the Shore in Leith, taking in the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street and the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill en route.Jamiersquos piece, Seascape with WEC, is a poem that captures her experience of witnessing new wave energy converters being tested on the Orkney islands. Graphic designer and animator Thomas Moulson brings the poem to le using vibrant colours inspired by ideas of symmetry and kinetic energy. These are subsequently animated by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri, the duo behind Bright Side Studios, who worked on last yearrsquos Message from the Skies alongside composer Pippa Murphy on Kapka Kassabovarsquos love letter to Europe projected onto the National Monument of Scotland on Calton Hill. This time out, Bright Side create a playful reflection of Moulsonrsquos visual interpretation of Jamiersquos words on the water above the Union Canal in Fountainbridge.Bright Side also take part in Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, Robin Robertsonrsquos personal reflection of the signicance of Scotlandrsquos seaside landscape in Scotlandrsquos identity as a seafaring nation, and takes the audience on a vast nationwide journey across the countryrsquos coastal geography. With Robertson narrating, Ten Thousand Miles of Edge is augmented by a new musical score by neo-trad troubadour Alasdair Roberts, who looks to Hebridean psalmody and piobiareachd to create something both sacred and elegiac. This is illuminated by Bright Side to create an immersive fusion of elements beamed onto the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill.As another Message from the Skies veteran, Pippa Murphy, provides a new score to accompany Lightkeepers, Charlotte Runciersquos meditation on lighthouses real and fictional, including those built by pioneering engineer Robert Stevenson, grand-father of fiction author extraordinaire, Robert Louise Stevenson. Utilising the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street as a backdrop, the piece features animations by Kate Charter to shine fresh light on such iconic myth-making structures. There is input here too from singer Karine Polwart, who narrates and sings as part of the piece.Finally, down by The Shore in Leith, local hero Irvine Welsh presents The Sea, which promises a mash-up of Welshrsquos words, film cut-ups by Norman Harman and industrial beats by DJ Steve Mac to illustrate Welshrsquos memoir of the influence of a sailor he met while growing up in Leith. Projections again come care of Double Take Projections, who take over the faccedilade of the Malmaison hotel, formerly the site of a sailorrsquos mission.With a downloadable app developed by Odd Panda Design accompanying the event, Message from the Skies is an immersive experience in every way.ldquoWater is such a rich theme, says Amanda Rogers, producer of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies event, ldquoand each piece sits in its own world, butyou walk to all five pieces, with the sound and visuals you get a full experience. Itrsquos not just words on a wall.Beyond Sugar for Your Tea, Bankole is back in the studio with Massaquoi and Hastings working on new Young Fathers material.ldquoThatrsquos where Irsquom happiest,rsquo says Bankole, ldquocollaborating with my brothers, experimenting. Having two other iniduals pushing me gives me a dferent perspective, and doesnrsquot feel like yoursquore in an echo chamber. It feels like my happy place.Message from the Skies runs as part of Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay until January  from pm to pm each night.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"jim-wallace-confirmed-scots-jazz-legend-not-imposter","story":"Newly opened archives show saxophone legend Tommy Smith wrote to the Orkney MSP asking for a character reference to help him create a new jazz academy in .At the time, the Edinburgh-born musician had run the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra for almost a decade and wanted to name its teaching arm the ldquoScottish Jazz Academy.In a letter to Mr Wallace in the National Records of Scotland, Mr Smith said Companies House, the government body which registers businesses, wanted proof of his bona fides.He wrote that it ldquorequires references from important people like you as the use of the word Scottish is sensitive.ldquoCompanies House are careful who they designate...and trust we are worthy of the title, and not some charlatan imposter.Mr Wallace drafted a reply saying use of the word Scottish would be ldquoentirely appropriate.He wrote: ldquoYour personal contribution to jazz in Scotland, and indeed internationally, is both known and most highly regarded.

Where the wrong decision had been made and he had the chance to correct it, he was happy to do so.ldquoHe said that it had been a great honour to represent Scotland at the commemorations in Normandy on Sunday,  June on the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The ceremonies had been very professional and emotional.ldquoThe contribution and sacrice which Scots, and forces from all over the world, had made to the liberation of Europe through their involvement in the Normandy landings had ensured the preservation of democracy.ldquoHe paid tribute to those who had given their lives in the landings.An analysis of news and current events presented to the cabinet described Mr McConnell enduring ldquofierce criticism for turning down an invitation to attend the D-Day commemorations.:National Records: How McConnell said Whitehall would put Scottish Executive in \"intolerable position\"After he reversed his position, there were then ldquonumerous articles and editorial in the weekend newspapers, ldquomainly focused on the First Ministerrsquos lsquoU-turnrsquo and the role played by his advisers.Bizarrely, the then Labour First Minister of Wales was caught up in a similar row, agreeing to attend a golf event at the Celtic Manor resort near Newport to discuss Wales hosting the  Ryder Cup, instead of going to Normandy.Other cabinet minutes also show Mr McConnell trying to fix another of his mistakes.After publicly supporting Glasgow singer Michelle McManus through her successful bid to win TVrsquos Pop Idol in , he conspicuously failed to congratulate Ayrshire violinist Nicola Benedetti when she won the less-watched BBC Young Musician of the Year in .He called three days later - after growing public criticism - and suddenly announced he was holding a reception for successful young Scots.The cabinet minute of  May  records: ldquoThe First Minister said that he had congratulated Nicola Benedetti on being the first Scot to win the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition.ldquoShe was one of many Scottish young people who had awards and recognition in ious fields, including sport and culture.

We knew it was looming, like the iceberg that did for RMS Titanic, or a new season of River City. But nothing could have prepared us for the sheer, buttock-aching blandness of it all.Perhaps we should not judge too harshly. Ms Bird had herself warned of the intense scrutiny that comes with presenting one of the biggest shows of the year. ldquoThe word Hogmanay, she told a newspaper last week, ldquocomes from the Norse Hog-maan-aye, which roughly translated means: to give anything on the telly on December  a kicking.Jackie was so good at the job it took three people to replace her this year: Susan Calman, who is on Radio  more often than the pips comedian Des Clarke and entertainment reporter Amy Irons. Even then, the programme relied onlots ofpre-recorded material, something total pro Jackie never did. In a further sign of the scorched earth policy pursued by BBC Scotland chiefs, musicians Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain had been given their jotters.The evening began with a half hour show on BBC Scotland, just to make sure the new channel on the block felt included and useful. No point spending pound million on a dog and doing all the barking yourself. Susan Calmanrsquos Not Quite the End of the Year Show was a chat session so cosy and congratulatory it made Wogan look like Stalinrsquos show trials. The tone for the evening was set: safety first, mind how you go, have any flavour you like as long as it is vanilla.The main event kicked off at . on BBC Scotland and was simulcast on BBC Scotland. We were back in what looked like the prerecorded chat show with Calman. Her guests earlier in the evening, James Cosmoand Mark Bonnar , had been joined by Line of Dutyrsquos Martin Compston and Jane McCarry of Still Game. Tame banter followed.The hard work was being done by Clarke in Edinburgh and Irons in Stonehaven. Irons was shouty and hoarse, but at least she was animated. Clarke was confident and competent, though he was rather ahead of the crowd on the big countdown.Back indoors, Travis continued to play the studio gig like it was a corporate event, with the audience standing around like some middle aged Top of the Pops crowd who were missing their beds.As for the rest of it, particularly the Calman end of things, where was the jeopardy, the excitement, the raw buzz of a truly live gig  The only part that offered genuine bangs for the viewerrsquos buck were the fireworks after the bells. Otherwise, this was a Hogmanay show that felt like it had been cooked earlier and was being reheated on the night.Oh Jackie, you were missed.Stand by for an important announcement. Clear small children and pets from the area, secure breakable objects and make grannyrsquos a double. Ready  Good people of Scotland, Only an Excuse is funny again.Now, let us not get carried away here. Post-appendectomy patients watching were in no danger of bursting their stitches. But my God, the relief. How many years have we sat through half an hour of excruciating humourlessness with a rictus grin on our collective coupon, only to come away disappointed Changes had been made, notably drafting in extra bodies so that Jonathan Watson did not have to carry the show alone. Smart move. Even Eric had his Ernie. Watson was joined by Mark Cox, Joy McAvoy, Louise McCarthy and Alex Norton. Yes, wummin were there, and not just to be the object of lame Frank McAvennie gags. There was even a wummin in the ten-strong writing team. Just one, but it is a start.

Someone commission Cruachan Hydro Electric Power Station, Scotlandrsquos answer to Chernobyl, now.Sure, there were still some mirth-free stretches and misfires, but this was Scots comedy tailored for a Scots audience more importantly it was funny.Jack Docherty is a cheeky article. Researchers on Selling Scotland, a look at how the country has been depicted in ads down the years, had unearthed one of the first recorded Scottish commercials. Dated  and shown in American cinemas, it featured a gang of kilt-wearing teuchters selling whisky.ldquoThis strange, grainy clip, said the Scot Squad star, ldquois last yearrsquos STV Hogmanay special. Cheeky, but on the money. When it comes to Hogmanay, STVrsquos offerings in recent years have been televisual mince. Last year Lulu was wheeled out for a ldquoHogmanay Hooley that had all the atmosphere of a flu jab session in your local GPsrsquo surgery, and who can forget the year Elaine C Smith welcomed in the New Year with Nicola Sturgeon in a recreated s living room  Oh, the banter.In Seanrsquos Very Scottish Hogmanay the Sean in question was Batty, not Connery. Weatherman of the STV parish, Sean is licensed to tell you when it is going to bucket down.The location for the party, Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire, was a cut above. Gold star for the production team on that one, eventhe rather snug surroundings made it look as though we were dropping in on the smallest ceilidh in the world.Dressed in full kilt with accessorising earpiece, Sean took to the part of host with his trademark big daft laddie gusto. Besides interviewing the laird and his we, he had been out and about filming segments on Hogmanay traditions. In the Borders he made black bun, and in Dundee he watched two women put a dress on a herring. Something to do with ensuring the family fish barrel would always be full, or so they told him.Meanwhile, back in the castle, Seanrsquos presenting partner, Jenner Reoch, was learning what the Craufurd family ate in olden days . ldquoItrsquos basically Instagram, said a thrilled Reoch as the laird read from old kitchen diaries.True, Sean and Jen gave Emily Maitlis and Andrew Neil nothing to worry about on the interviewing front, and the production flowed as naturally as treacle uphill, but at least an effort had been made to offer something fresh.Selling Scotlandhad the slickness, but it was  minutes of telly trying to pass as an hourrsquos worth. Much of the territory, including the Tennentrsquos ldquolager lovelies, had been covered before, though it was nice to see the likes of Molly Weir popping into neighboursrsquo houses uninvited to show them how to clean a floor with Flash, and pea and ham from a chicken will always raise a smile.As was pointed out several times, the ads were very much of their time, which apparently made it fine to show sexism and racism that would not have made it through the door any other night.ldquoI canrsquot believe we got away with showing all those ads on the BBC, said Docherty as the show closed. Neither can I, but thatrsquos Hogmanay telly for you a lot of cheek, a bit of charm, and thank Rabbie Burns it is over again for another year."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-100-ways-survive-2020","story":"Count butterflies.Give a pint of blood.Visit a gallery at least once a month.

As we approach the end of this decade , a great deal seems to have changed in political terms, and yet not at all in the way that most of us might have anticipated ten years ago.We were sure that we were in for a tough time of it, economically. The optimistic view was then that the discipline involved in austerity would lead to root and branch reform of the structures of capitalism, tackling monopolistic firms and overhauling the banking system. There was also the expectation that it would offer the opportunity for a rolling back of the state, welfare and pensions reform and a radical reconstruction of the tax system.But almost none of that happened. The banks and the corporatist rent-seekers continue much as before. The reduction in public spending has not been strictly speaking, a reduction in spending, but merely a reduction in the rate of its increase. The tax burden is at a high as is the national debt. The new government ndash a Conservative government, allegedly ndash is aiming to spend even more.The changes, which never transpired, were to be ushered in by a new sort of consensual, centrist politics in the form of the ldquoheir to Blair, David Cameron, and his Liberal Democrat partners. His jibe to Mr Blair, that he ldquowas the future once, looks more pointed now that Mr Cameron himself is history, while his programme of reforms, promises of stability, ldquoa new kind of politics and a ldquoBig Society, are as dead as the Charleston.What was going to be the decade of consensus turned out to be contention and ision on an almost unprecedented scaleyou were looking for historical comparisons you would probably have to pick something like Irish Home Rule or the Corn Laws. What was going to be a transformative politics turned out to be a period of paralysis ndash the apparent paradox is that one reason the political landscape now looks so dferent is that almost nothing could be done while Brexit and independence swept aside the day-to-day issues.The other thing wildly dferent from what might have been assumed ten years ago is where the centre ground in politics actually is. When Mr Cameron and ldquoI agree with Nick Clegg appeared in the garden of Number , we expected government that would be, for the foreseeable future, fiscally conservative and socially liberal.But now that it appears that nobody agrees with Nick, or with his successors in the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, it looks asthe UKrsquos political centre is voters who are fiscally slightly to the centre-left, and socially rather more conservative than metropolitan liberals would like.Contrary to the claims of their opponents, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson have not moved sharply to the right ndash with the exception of their rhetoric on immigration, which, awkwardly for liberals, seems to chime with the general opinion of the voters. In most other regards, the Tories have become steadily more centrist, especially on public spending, while remaining socially liberal on most issues.If it doesnrsquot look like that to some people, itrsquos because the Labour Party has been even more radically transformed into what, to all intents and purposes, seems to be the Bennite wing of the Labour Party in the s. Amazingly, after their catastrophic results in the election, the membership seems inclined to double down on this position, despite the evidence that the only people inclined to vote Labour are their own activists. A membership of around , may be the biggest of any European political party, but itrsquos not an awfully big percentage of the UK electorate.The SNP, unsurprisingly, continues to bang on about independence, which is fair enough, since it is its raison drsquoecirctre. The partyrsquos persistent strength is obviously in part due to their success in converting so many Scots to the cause, but it presents them with problems, too.One is the dficulty of uniting the country on anything  when the subject dominates all discourse another is the practical matter of being the government, and being expected to deliver on domestic policy issues. Long-term electoral success, as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair discovered, always leads to public disenchantment eventually.We start the new decade with a UK government once more promising real change and improvement. The Whig theory of historymade the assumption that you could explain the present in terms of the past, with the implication that the present was better. Irsquom not sure anyone believes that anymore. On the evidence of the past decade, we should probably just expect the unexpected."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole.

I would further point out to Mr Roden that in the interests of compromise and to lessen the effects of the chaos about to engulf Scotland, Ms Sturgeon offered to take a second independence vote off the tablethe then Prime Minister Theresa May would agree to Scotland remaining within the single market and customs union a request which was denied.Following the result of the General Election, which means that there will not be a second EU referendum and that the UK is definitely leaving the EU, Mr Roden comments that ldquowe will now never know for surethat is what the people really want.

Banks who have made the cuts consistently say that it is the result of customers preferring to use online, mobile or telephone banking while usage of branches has fallen.Which  said the new figures showed how the UK government should step in to protect peoplersquos access to cash.:South Lanarkshire town that was left with no banksJenny Ross, Which  Money Editor, said: ldquoCountless Scottish communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying many people free withdrawals.ldquoMismangement by the industry and regulators has led to a massive spike in fee-charging machines, while rampant bank branch and cashpoint closures are stripping people of vital cash access and have left the cash landscape on the brink of collapse.ldquoThe UKrsquos new government should seize the opportunity to act now and introduce legislation that protects this important payment method for as long as it is needed.Last month, the Herald revealed that ministers had refused to intervene in the access-to-cash crisis.A UK government response said: ldquoGovernment cannot reverse the changes in the market and in customer behaviour, nor can it determine firmsrsquo commercial strategies in response to those changes.

But we can wallow in the process, the squirming, because the members of the upper house have all been sent a copy of Do the Right Thing, by former Arkansas Governor and Christian Minister Mike Huckabee.

But there are bigger questions here, deserving of more attention, both around what sort of member state an independent Scotland might be, and of what the Scottish Government can do now to reinforce European relations despite Brexit.Many in Scotland have looked at the EUrsquos support for Ireland through the tortuous Brexit process and seen a small country with a seat at the table, that has had the strong backing of the other  EU member states, and that played an exemplary diplomatic game throughout. But being a small country in the EU isnrsquot always easy. It takes political nous, strategy, compromise and collaboration. The EUrsquos smaller states adapt to its terrain in dferent ways, with ying political outlooks, and dfering degrees of success.So how does the current world of smaller EU states look as we enter a new decade  The EU is primarily made up of smaller states, a fact that often gets overlooked as the shting political dynamics of the Franco-German couple sit centre stage. And certainly, the larger member states have always had more power. But the EU has always run too on a mixture of one-off and longer term coalitions between dferent countries. Even at the start, in , the smaller threesome of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg cooperated as the Benelux group to hold their own in the face of the larger trio of France, Germany and Italy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"description\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media PsvcXF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests PsvcXF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : SNPMP admits chance of Indyref this year is probably lsquonilrsquoToday, one of the newest groupings of smaller states is the so-called new Hanseatic League covering the Netherlands, Ireland and the Nordic and Baltic states. The League was set up in , driven partly by the looming impact of Brexit: to many the UK was an important EU partner who needed replacing with new networks. But the Hanseatic League also aims to oppose Francersquos efforts to loosen orthodox economic and monetary policies around the euro.So while an independent Scotland might indeed be well advised to look first to its geographical neighbours for alliances, a neoliberal Hanseatic grouping would not be the most obvious place to start. But within that group there are countries Scotland could learn from. Ireland has worked hard at putting itself in the core of the EU ndash joining the euro, even while staying out of Schengen to protect the Ireland-UK common travel area. Finland too similarly made sure it is not on the sidelines.But an independent Scotland in the EU is not expected to join the euro in a hurry so it would be less of a core player. And the motley group of eight member states not in the euro including, apart from Denmark and Sweden, six central and eastern European member states, is not strong. The UK, with its euro opt-out, gave a certain clout to this group, disappearing now given Brexit.Perhaps an independent Scotland could be like Sweden ndash putting off indefinitely joining the euro, progressive on human rights, gender, climate change and migration  Or it could look further afield for role models ndash Portugal is currently showing how anti-austerity policies can work, just about, while being within the eurozone.:Sturgeon reassures EU citizens in New Year messageWhatever the strategy and policy stance, being a well-regarded EU member state depends on playing a constructive, cooperative game, with excellent diplomatic and networking skills, building bilateral and multilateral alliances, showing commitment to the EU as a whole not just to onersquos own narrow interests. Certainly, an independent Scotland in the EU ndash and in accession negotiations ndash would have, not least, to show it was not going to be a mini-UK, being one of the awkward squad and demandingmultiple opt-outs.All this is some way off, should Scotland eventually choose independence. But her international and European relationships need more not less work now to limit the damage that Brexit will do.The Scottish Government has already taken ious initiatives in its European work. It has a Nordic-Baltic strategy. And it has established government offices and ldquoinnovation and investment hubsin Brussels, Dublin, London, Paris and Berlin. A new review into strengthening Ireland-Scotland relationships should report this March.:Foreign property investors poised to swoop on ScotlandBut there is much more that could be done. The European Union is at the start of a new five-year term ndash with new Commission and Council presidents and big challenges ahead in a turbulent world. Scotland should have a clear European strategy setting out its interests and goals for the EU, and how it would hope to contribute and participate even from the outside, ranging from the environment and climate change to human rights, education, research, culture, competitiveness and the much-discussed green new deal. Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands ndash even big regions like Baia ndash have clearly set out European strategies.True, foreign policy is not a devolved power but around the world cities, regions and sub-states are increasingly cooperating internationally on many key issues. Yet the Scottish Government seems a little nervous of being seen to have too clear or deliberate a para-diplomacy strategy. Such nerves should be set aside.A Scottish European strategy could be the centre of a wider international strategy and would strengthen Scotlandrsquos bilateral relationships across the EU. That would be helpful to Scotland today and, potentially, to the Scottish Governmentrsquos EU accession aspirations.Paradiplomacy on climate change is one example. There will quite likely be a row in  over the next big climate summit, COP, taking place in Glasgow in the autumn ndash the UK Government will aim to be centre stage and side-line the Scottish Government. But a Scottish Government that is working strategically with other EU member states, showing adept paradiplomacy, in the run up to COP may hold its own perfectly well.Amidst the Brexit furore, Scotland has established a quite distinct, pro-European image across the EU. The challenge now is to build on that to promote Scotlandrsquos wide, dense range of Scottish-EU networks and interests. Andthat is done well, Scotland will already be showing ndash to itself and to the EU ndash the sort of member state an independent Scotland might one day be.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tv-tantrums","story":"GARY: Tank Commander star Greg McHugh has received plaudits for his comedy turn in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the SSE Hydro.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPrsquos handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions.copy -.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

But it doesnt look at the moment asthe winner will come from the left of the party. Right now anyway, Keir Starmer looks to be heading for a fairly emphatic victory.\"At present only shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow treasury minister, Clive Lewis, have formally announced they will stand for the party leadership. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and party chairman Ian Lavery, are also believed to be considering entering the contest. Today on the BBC, former Chancellor Ed Balls, refused to confirm or deny whether his we, Commons Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper, would stand. She lost to Corbyn in the  leadership race.: So, who  wants to be Labour leader  ndash Bill JamiesonThe poll of  Labour party members put Sir Keir on  per cent for first choice votes, while  per cent backed Ms Long Bailey, Ms Phillips received  per cent, and Mr Lewis and Ms Cooper were the first choice for seven per cent. Ms Thornberry was on six per cent and Ms Nandy was backed by five per cent as first choice.With less popular candidates eliminated, a final run-off would see Sir Keir beat Ms Long Bailey in the last round,  per cent to  per cent, according to the survey.Sir Keir is backed as first choice by  per cent of Remainers in the survey, but only supported by  per cent of Leavers.Yesterday leadership contender Clive Lewis issued a plea for unity in the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn and said the party faces an \"existential crisis\".The shadow treasury minister said when you were \"on a clf-edge\" it was better to work with the people \"dangling with you\", rather than attack them. His comments came in Twitter remarks after media outlets contacted him for his views on party chairman Ian Laverys analysis of why Labour lost so heavily.: It will take a leader of extraordinary charisma to deliver a Labour victoryMr Lavery has said Labour lost the general election because of its \"Brexit position, infighting, a collapse of industry in our communities and a lack of trust in our ability to deliver.\"But Norwich South MP Mr Lewis tweeted: \"Whilst I dont agree with everything hes said I do agree with parts of his analysis.\"So perhapsall we use the comingelections as a lens through which to listen to each other, we can work out a path ahead.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/35ef6/38828480.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/ward.jpg","title":"record numbers wait 12 hours or longer to be treated in northern ireland a and e departments","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The figures have been branded a \"record-breaking\" failure by a leading emergency care doctor, who has blasted the situation being endured by staff and patients here.Dr Ian Crawford, vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland, said: \"A staggering , patients spent longer than  hours in our EDs in October  - yet another record-breaking systemic failure for our patients and staff.\"It is simply unacceptable that, in the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, no one is being held to account for the ever-deepening crisis in health and social care.\"Political oversight is immediately required to secure the corrective investment to increase staffing, the number of acute hospital beds and the social care that are fundamentally required.\"The figures come as the deadline for the political parties to get the Assembly back up and running is fast approaching.Secretary of State Julian Smith has given MLAs until January  to re-establish the Executive or face another election.They are coming under increasing pressure to find a resolution as Mr Smith has continually insisted that he cannot intervene to address the deepening crisis in the health service.Thousands of health service employees have already staged walk outs, with further strike action planned for the New Year.The Royal College of Nursing has already said its members will strike on January  and  after taking part in a -hour walkout on December .Meanwhile, most recent government figures revealed there are more than , people waiting for a first outpatient appointment.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. “The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.”SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has said that parties must enter today’s negotiations prepared for the compromises necessary to restore power sharing.He said: “Later this week, after months of talking about partnership and compromise in TV debates and newspaper articles, political leaders have the opportunity to show that it wasn’t just talk. “For almost three years we have been without a government to deal with hospital waiting lists, pay parity for healthcare workers, the funding crisis in our schools and the welfare clf edge about to hit tens of thousands of families. It’s time to get back to work.“The SDLP has made compromise proposals already. With less than two weeks to secure a resolution, all parties must be prepared to stretch themselves in the substantial common interests of all our communities.”Meanwhile, UUP Leader Steve Aiken said his party is committed to building a better government through a “restored and reformed” Assembly and Executive.The British and Irish governments had been holding talks with the parties, however, they were paused over the Christmas holidays.The parties have until January  to negotiate a deal, otherwise Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith says he must call a fresh assembly election.January  will mark three years since Stormont collapsed, when the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Davis time at the Brandywell was ultimately one of frustration as he made just two starts and five substitute appearances in his brief time at the club. Davis scored just one goal in his time as a Candystripe, against his former club UCD in August, and was unable to break into the team ahead of either David Parkhouse or Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who were both in prolic form as City secured fourth place and European football.The -year old signed an -month deal at the Brandywell when he joined and made his debut as a substitute in a - draw against Dundalk at the Brandywell in June. His appearances were limited thereafter however, as he played less than  minutes overall in the first team, making just one appearance in the final ten games of the season. Davis expected departure leaves Declan Devine even lighter in attack with the opening game of the  season at Oriel Park just a month and a half away. With loan deals for Parkhouse and Junior expiring in October past, the City boss has been on the search for quality strikers to replace the  goals and  assists the duo provided. Devine remains hopeful of attracting Junior back to the Brandywell in the coming weeks, but whoever comes in to fill the strikers roles at the Brandywell, the manager is determined that they will be more than good enough.“We are continuing to work in the market to bring high quality players to the club because I think thats what our fans deserve and what our fellow players deserve,” he said. “Everybody we have brought to the club are people who want to do well. There is a lot of hunger in the guys we have brought to the club, a lot of hunger to come here and really be a part of the culture of Derry City again and to re-establish ourselves is a major force, which is what we have always said. “Whether that can be done in  months,  months or  months, it certainly helps when you bring quality players to the club, like we have done already.” googletag.cmd.push Pre-season Devine and his players meanwhile begin pre-season training tomorrow.

Davis time at the Brandywell was ultimately one of frustration as he made just two starts and five substitute appearances in his brief time at the club. Davis scored just one goal in his time as a Candystripe, against his former club UCD in August, and was unable to break into the team ahead of either David Parkhouse or Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who were both in prolic form as City secured fourth place and European football.The -year old signed an -month deal at the Brandywell when he joined and made his debut as a substitute in a - draw against Dundalk at the Brandywell in June. His appearances were limited thereafter however, as he played less than  minutes overall in the first team, making just one appearance in the final ten games of the season. Davis expected departure leaves Declan Devine even lighter in attack with the opening game of the  season at Oriel Park just a month and a half away. With loan deals for Parkhouse and Junior expiring in October past, the City boss has been on the search for quality strikers to replace the  goals and  assists the duo provided. Devine remains hopeful of attracting Junior back to the Brandywell in the coming weeks, but whoever comes in to fill the strikers roles at the Brandywell, the manager is determined that they will be more than good enough.“We are continuing to work in the market to bring high quality players to the club because I think thats what our fans deserve and what our fellow players deserve,” he said. “Everybody we have brought to the club are people who want to do well. There is a lot of hunger in the guys we have brought to the club, a lot of hunger to come here and really be a part of the culture of Derry City again and to re-establish ourselves is a major force, which is what we have always said. “Whether that can be done in  months,  months or  months, it certainly helps when you bring quality players to the club, like we have done already.” googletag.cmd.push Pre-season Devine and his players meanwhile begin pre-season training tomorrow. With players like Parkhouse, Ogedi-Uzokwe, Greg Sloggett, Aidy Delap, Darren McCauley and possibly Barry McNamee missing this time around, there is still likely to be a number of changes at the Brandywell in the coming weeks, with trialists expected to join pre-season training as of next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPrsquos handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Talks resume to restore NI powersharing article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
