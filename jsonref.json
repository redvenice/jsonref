Let\u0027s open up the conversation and do some more research.\u0027I\u0027ll do some more research and I\u0027ll talk again.\u0027When pressed, he added: \u0027I won\u0027t be beat into submission of having lack of information on camera.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s a political ad for the Dems\u0027: Trump lays into SNL...Share this articleReferencing an upcoming appearance on TMZ Live, he added: \u0027I\u0027m gonna go and build up the information and I\u0027ll speak... tomorrow about it.\u0027In a nearly three-minute conversation, Kanye admitted that his \u0027slavery in disguise\u0027 comment was something that needed to be researched.\u0027What I was saying is that the 13th Amendment is really slavery in disguise and it\u0027s something that we need to look into.\u0027I\u0027m opening up the conversation. When I speak, I have a feeling and I open up the conversation and I think we don\u0027t want to talk about… let me explain some of the things that I… that I wrote down on the plane.\u0027The principals that wrote the Constitution were Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine and John Adams – all white men. No women, no Jews, no black men. And we need to look at it. We need to examine it. One of the things about me tweeting about the First Amendment is the right to free speech.      The rapper sparked confusion during his appearance on Saturday Night Live when he wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front          Kanye performed on Saturday Night Live with fellow rapper Lil Pump dressed as water bottlesHis speech was met with a smattering of applause but louder booing from the New York audience. One New Yorker who didn\u0027t seem to mind though was Trump himself, who tweeted out his support Sunday - even though he claimed he had not seen the show.\u0027Like many, I don\u0027t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm,\u0027 wrote Trump.\u0027It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told \u0027no\u0027), was great. He\u0027s leading the charge!\u0027 An hour later, Trump randomly declared his confidence in winning the \u0027Black Vote\u0027 - despite the fact he only claimed eight percent of the black vote in 2016.  \u0027So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!\u0027 he tweeted on Sunday.           West\u0027s tweets were met with dozens of responses as some fans asked him to explain his comments more directly and others slammed him for writing nonsense     The rapper said this week he had \u0027redesigned\u0027 the controversial hat and \u0027put positive energy into it\u0027. It is unclear why Kanye was wearing a Free Hoover shirt, but it appears to be related to Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover (right)Meanwhile, Kanye posted a selfie wearing the Make America Great Again cap while flying, adding: \u0027this represents good and America becoming whole again. \u0027We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. \u0027We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment. Message sent with love.\u0027Many fans replied to his tweets with direct excerpts from the 13th Amendment, asking him to explain his musings more directly.The amendment reads: \u0027Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u0027  One user @King_Yunn wrote: \u0027Saying abolish the amendment that also help (sic) abolish slavery without being specific on what you mean by abolishing it...is him purposely being indirect for drama?\u0027Another follower @AlishaFruits wrote: \u0027There\u0027s a hundred different ways he could\u0027ve said it without sounding like an uneducated fool and stirring up unnecessary controversy, but that\u0027s all he\u0027s got.\u0027  One of the sharpest rebukes came from actor Chris Evans, who tweeted: \u0027There\u0027s nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn\u0027t know history, doesn\u0027t read books, and frames their myopia as virtue. \u0027The level of unapologetic conjecture I\u0027ve encountered lately isn\u0027t just frustrating, it\u0027s retrogressive, unprecedented and absolutely terrifying.\u0027Arguably the most prominent theory posed was that West\u0027s critique of the 13th Amendment is centered on a specific clause in the writing which says people who have been convicted of a crime can still be enslaved. One Twitter user behind this theory, @LBS4L, wrote: \u0027he\u0027s obviously referring to the \u0027as a punishment for crime\u0027 part. there is a reason why the US has the most prisoners total and per capita. it\u0027s because prison labor is akin to modern day slavery. he has talked about this in his music before (sic).\u0027 Such an explanation is supported by the fact that during his SNL performance  West wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front.The sweatshirt reportedly refers to jailed Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover. Hoover founded the Chicago street gang the Gangster Disciples. He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.     Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 It\u0027s not the first time West has shared controversial opinions about slavery. The rapper sparked outrage in May when he called slavery a \u0027choice\u0027 during an interview with TMZ. \u0027When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were there for 400 years and it\u0027s all of y\u0027all. It\u0027s like we\u0027re mentally imprisoned.\u0027It wasn\u0027t until months later that West finally apologized for the outburst during a radio appearance in late August.West told WGCI he never \u0027approached or addressed the slavery comment fully\u0027 because \u0027it\u0027s not something for me to overly intellectualize\u0027.He then apologized for how his tone and how his actions, including wearing the MAGA hat on several occasions, have affected his fans.            West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016\u0027I\u0027m sorry for the one-two of the MAGA hat into the slavery comment. And I\u0027m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment,\u0027 he said.Fans praised what appeared to be a heartfelt apology, but were in for another let down when West unveiled his redesigned version of the red cap bearing Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign earlier this week. He told Fader that he had added \u0027positive energy\u0027 to the hat by flattening the brim and changing its shape slightly.   Kanye has stunned fans by becoming one of the few celebrities - as well as one of the only prominent African Americans - to support Trump.He went to visit Trump in 2016 shortly after the rapper disappeared to seek mental health treatment.His wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian, has gone twice to see Trump at the White House.Kanye recently promised that a new album, called \u0027Yahndi,\u0027 would come out on Saturday but no work immediately appeared.    Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADERKanye West Says His Slavery Comment Abolishing 13th Amendment is Work in Progress | TMZ.com"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/21/4E919DF000000578-0-image-a-5_1532550973907.jpg","title":"Who Julie Swetnick Brett Kavanugh accuser revealed","story":"    Swetnick is the third woman to publicly allege that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconductBut just who is Kavanaugh’s newest accuser, Julie Swetnick?

This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. What\u0026#8217s on Netflix UK October 2018Red Dead Redemption 2 PS4 DLC revealed as Rockstar say game will require 105gb of hard drive spaceStoptober 2018: Public Health England Campaign to quit smoking revealedWho is Roger Mathews?

We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment. Message sent with love.\u0027  West called for the 13th Amendment to be abolished in the caption of his MAGA selfie Sunday          He clarified his call to abolish the 13th Amendment in two tweets later in the day Sunday, but fans have still be left scratching their heads over the rapper\u0027s bizarre commentsMany fans replied to West\u0027s tweets with direct excerpts from the 13th Amendment, asking him to explain his musings more directly. The amendment reads: \u0027Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u0027  One user @King_Yunn wrote: \u0027Saying abolish the amendment that also help (sic) abolish slavery without being specific on what you mean by abolishing it...is him purposely being indirect for drama?\u0027Another follower @AlishaFruits wrote: \u0027There’s a hundred different ways he could’ve said it without sounding like an uneducated fool and stirring up unnecessary controversy, but that’s all he’s got.\u0027  One of the sharpest criticisms came from actor Chris Evans, who tweeted: \u0027There’s nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn’t know history, doesn’t read books, and frames their myopia as virtue. \u0027The level of unapologetic conjecture I’ve encountered lately isn’t just frustrating, it’s retrogressive, unprecedented and absolutely terrifying.\u0027          West\u0027s tweets were met with dozens of responses as some fans asked him to explain his comments more directly and others slammed him for writing nonsense \u0027It\u0027s a political ad for the Dems\u0027: Trump lays into SNL...Share this articleArguably the most prominent theory posed was that West\u0027s critique of the 13th Amendment is centered on a specific clause in the writing which says people who have been convicted of a crime can still be enslaved. One Twitter user behind this theory, @LBS4L, wrote: \u0027he\u0027s obviously referring to the as a punishment for crime part. there is a reason why the US has the most prisoners total and per capita. it\u0027s because prison labor is akin to modern day slavery. he has talked about this in his music before (sic).\u0027 Such an explanation is supported by the fact that during his SNL performance  West wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front.The sweatshirt reportedly refers to jailed Chicago street gang leader Larry Hoover. Hoover founded the Chicago street gang the Gangster Disciples. He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.               West sparked confusion during his appearance on Saturday Night Live when he wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front    The rapper said this week he had \u0027redesigned\u0027 the controversial hat and \u0027put positive energy into it\u0027. It is unclear why Kanye was wearing a Free Hoover shirt, but it appears to be related to Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover (right)    West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016However, Trump himself appeared to appreciate Kanye\u0027s words during the show that took aim at the president\u0027s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\u0027Like many, I don\u0027t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm,\u0027 Trump tweeted on Sunday. \u0027It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told no) was great. He\u0027s leading the charge!\u0027 An hour later, Trump randomly declared his confidence in winning the \u0027Black Vote\u0027 - despite the fact he only claimed eight percent of the black vote in 2016.  \u0027So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!\u0027 he tweeted on Sunday. Trump then took aim at the FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford\u0027s sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, which he only launched after it was demanded by Sen Jeff Flake on Friday.  \u0027Wow!

Staff are reluctant to speak on the record for fear of retaliation and the company has recently started training managers to fight back against union organization.“They’re squeezing all they can out of the workers. Amazon gives little notice whenever they make changes. When they rolled in the Amazon Prime discount, they only gave stores ten to fourteen days of notice and no extra labor to handle the extra work.”Whole Foods workers across the United States are beginning to collectively organize in an attempt to push back on changes made to the supermarket chain operations since Amazon acquired the company in August 2017.On 6 September, a group of workers sent out a letter to Whole Food stores across the country reaching out to fellow employees to discuss concerns with how Amazon has changed the company as part of the Whole Worker community.They cited the “Order-To-Shelf system”, which began three years ago and has accelerated under Amazon, and mass layoffs of certain positions as some of the primary reasons Whole Foods workers are now coordinating efforts to unionize.The Order-to-Shelf system is a strict set of procedures for employees to follow that uses scorecards to prescribe specific ways to store, display, purchase items on store shelves and in stock rooms.“The OTS system really aligns with Amazon’s core practices. It’s to make everyone interchangeable,” said a Whole Foods employee in the New England area involved in labor organizing. “They want us to become robots. That’s where they are going, they want to set it up so they don’t have to pay someone $15 an hour who knows all about the food, they can pay someone $10 an hour to do these small tasks and timed duties.”Whole Foods has a history of union busting even before Amazon acquired the company.In May 2016, Whole Foods paid the union-busting consulting firm Kulture Consulting more than $100,000 days before a union election for a distribution center in Pompano Beach, Florida.In 2017, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against Whole Foods for union busting tactics, as they amended the employee handbook to ban recording of all work related activities without management approval, an infringement on collective bargaining rights and labor law.“We want a return to where we were a few years ago,” added the New England area based Whole Foods employee. “Store teams used to make more. We had much better pay and were taking more money on our paychecks than we were making from our hourly wage when the company was successful, when it wasn’t self cannibalizing, when everybody had the tools to do their job.”The employee explained that under Amazon, Whole Foods workers are expected to do more with restricted labor budgets and often perform duties above their rank without being properly compensated. In addition, his region’s capital expenditure budget has been frozen. “We just got bought by the second trillion-dollar company in the world and we don’t have money to replace refrigeration units.” Amazon recently followed Apple to become the second company ever to be valued at over $1tn.Another New England area based Whole Foods employee told the  that despite drastic differences in store traffic and sales between August, when customers are on vacation, and September, when children go back to school, his labor budget only increased by $300 despite a projected increase in daily sales of $100,000. “We’re left to try to figure out how to do the impossible on shifts with not enough people to work,” the employee said. “It’s not the same place it was a year ago.”A Whole Foods employee in Southern California said the culture at Whole Foods had changed as upper management has focussed on maximizing profit and homogenizing stores. “Local and speciality products have been cut and replaced with more conventional mainstream ones, and regional marketing and sign making has been removed,” they said. “We are losing the shopper and team members who helped make us who we were.”Under Amazon’s ownership, profit-sharing for employees – once a major perk of working for the company – has reportedly been eliminated. “Jeff Bezos should not have earned $150bn while the majority of his workers live paycheck to paycheck and do not receive profit sharing,” stated the letter sent out to Whole Foods employees by the Whole Worker Community. “The clandestine nature of Amazon offering stock options to store leadership without informing TMs (team members) is beyond problematic. It is insulting and unethical.”Whole Foods has also gradually eliminated or drastically reduced classes of jobs, such as in-store graphic designers and payroll benefits specialists, and merged those duties into other positions without providing workers additional compensation. In a previous statement made in March 2018, Whole Foods said the cuts were made to support business needs.“We work for the wealthiest man in the world and our stores can’t afford to hire. If you actually want to build sales and increase market share, you need to spend the money to get it done,” said a Whole Foods employee based in Illinois who helps coordinate the Whole Worker community. “Corporations keep getting tax incentives, but when you don’t raise wages and you need two jobs just to make a living, what’s the point? We’re not getting anywhere as a society.”The employee added the short staffing and reduction in labor has fostered an environment at Whole Foods where employees are struggling to complete all their assigned duties, and unable to take the time required for customer service throughout the work day. “Even stopping to help somebody feels like a burden and it shouldn’t be that way.”Whole Foods declined to comment for this story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20147b3684bc5d4a98777f0a8c40a3d2479515e5/0_94_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7cfd275faa6578f7a34d38cd43d5d5e","title":"cities sink sea first earth submerge coastline","story":"The Earth isn’t solid – which makes it hard to predict how the submerging of our coastlines will unfoldBetter scientific understanding of global warming makes the discussion about its geopolitical consequences increasingly urgent. Put simply, there are going to be winners and losers: hotter places and colder places wetter places and drier places and, yes, places that disappear under the sea. But the reality is a bit more complicated. In particular, are sea levels going up or down? The answer seems clear when you consider that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tonnes of ice in the last 25 years.Yet to understand what is going on we first have to recognise that the Earth isn’t solid. It started life as a ball of hot liquid about 4.5bn years ago and our planet has been cooling ever since. Right at the centre of the Earth is a solid core of metal made of iron and nickel at a temperature of approximately 5,000C. But this core is surrounded by an approximately 2,000km-thick ocean of molten metal, again mostly iron and nickel. Surrounding this is a layer of rock called the mantle that is between 500C to 900C, and at these red-hot temperatures the rock behaves like a solid over short periods of time (seconds, hours, and days) but like a liquid over longer time periods (months to years) – so the rock flows, even though it is not molten. On top of the fluid mantle floats the crust, which is like the skin of the Earth. It is a relatively thin layer of cool rock that is between 30 to 100km thick and contains all the mountains, forests, rivers, seas, continents – our world.Since the crust is floating on the fluid mantle, if you increase its weight by, for instance, building up kilometres of ice on top of it, then it sinks further into the mantle. This is what has happened to the landmasses of Antarctica and Greenland, which are both covered in 2km to 3km of thick ice. If global warming were to cause all that ice to melt, then the sea level of the oceans would rise by more than 50 metres, submerging all the coastal cities of the world and making hundreds of millions of people homeless. This seems obvious. What is less obvious is how it might unfold.If the whole ice sheet covering Antarctica melts, the release of its weight will destress the rocks below, which, because they float on the mantle, will bob up. This is called post-glacial rebound. The position with Greenland is similar: the crust below it is being weighed down by the 3 million trillion litres of water held in the ice sheet, and if that ice sheet all melts then parts of the North American tectonic landmass will rise up. If the resulting increase in the height of the continent is bigger than the sea level rise, then major flooding may be avoided. Working out which scenario is more likely is vitally important for future generations, because one of these results will start to play out if global warming intensifies.What we know is this: the global mean sea level has risen 20cm since the beginning of the 20th century. Some of this has been owing to the water thermally expanding as the oceans have got hotter – since hotter liquids take up more volume (this is how liquid thermometers work). Some of the rise in sea level has been due to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melting, and some due to other glaciers melting. The rising sea levels are global: they affect everyone with a coastline, from tiny Pacific islands that would be entirely submerged to a huge country such as Bangladesh, for which a one-metre rise in sea levels would result in nearly a fifth of the country being submerged and 30 million people being displaced. But while rising sea levels affect everyone, the post-glacial rebound affects only the coasts connected to parts of the Earth’s crust weighed down by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.It is hard to overestimate the importance of this issue, and we badly need more data and scientific understanding of these liquid processes. A limited number of specialised satellites, such as CryoSat, GRACE and ICESat-2 – just launched by Nasa – are being used to monitor ice thickness and to develop models of post-glacial rebound. What the science predicts is that if the ice melts first in the northern hemisphere, then Greenland may bounce up higher than the average sea level, as will parts of North America, and so sea levels there may initially go down. If the opposite happens, and the Antarctic ice melts before the Greenland ice sheet, then it is the southern tectonic plates that will bounce up first and the whole of North America’s eastern coast will go under water first. The big unknowns are how quick the ice will go in each location, and how fast the post-glacial rebound will be.We need to get a better understanding of these processes fast, because if we don’t it may be too late to avert catastrophe. These issues don’t dominate news agendas but they should. Recently the French environment minister resigned, citing the president’s lack of progress and urgency on climate change issues. In doing so, he voiced the concern of the whole scientific community about world leaders – we need a step change in governmental action. But there’s the rub: not all governments feel urgent about it. And why? Perhaps it’s because, as the issue of post-glacial rebound shows, there will be winners and losers from global warming. For instance, countries such as Russia will be less affected by sea level rises, and may benefit from a more temperate climate. In contrast, the US may not only suffer from new drought zones, but its low-lying eastern coast is threatened by the accelerating loss of Antarctic ice. As the 21st century continues and the ice continues to melt, it will become clearer which countries have a greater incentive to mitigate climate change, and the resulting geopolitics has the potential to drive ision and conflict.• Mark Miodownik is the author of Liquid: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flow Through Our Lives, which is short-listed for the Royal Society Book prize"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23137aca0de1ddfa408955234edf165d606aaa4a/822_2603_4077_2445/master/4077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a4e56fc6aa3bd630e1a8ee1a98443ab","title":"matilda roald dahl 30 quentin blake","story":"Quentin Blake’s depictions of Matilda as an explorer and astrophysicist highlight how slow progress is in the real worldQuentin Blake’s new illustrations for the covers of Matilda, celebrating 30 years of the book, provoke a mixture of emotions, simultaneously empowering and bittersweet. On the one hand, it is glorious to see Matilda at 30, taking on the role of explorer, astrophysicist, or running the British Library. We need to see that happening. It makes us all reflect on what an intelligent, imaginative and industrious girl ought to be able to be. So why is it also just a tiny bit unsettling? Why does a part of us not want to know what Matilda has become? Somewhere in our heart of hearts we never want Matilda to grow up – we want her to be like Peter Pan, eternally young.For one of the most exciting things about Matilda as a character is that she can obstinately think and imagine her way out of impossible situations, a peculiarly child-like characteristic, and perhaps we worry that if she grows up she might lose that magic.And this reflects a tension inherent in all children’s books, which are almost always about growing up. My How to Train Your Dragon books are narrated by Hiccup as an old man looking back on his childhood, just as all adults reading children’s books aloud with their child are carried back into remembering what it is to want magic to shoot out of your fingers, to push at the back of a cupboard and find Narnia behind it, to look once again through the cool, clear eyes of a child, when a belief in the impossible is as natural as breathing. This is on the one hand exhilarating, going back to a time when all options are open, even the impossible ones, but at the same time a little melancholy, for the adult is looking back with experience. They know how the story ends, for them, at any rate, and for their generation.Looking at those Matilda covers makes us question how far we have come as a society in 30 years. That’s where the bittersweet part comes in. Not far enough.When I was a child, Matilda had not been written yet (I’d have loved her when I was nine) but I clung on hard to heroes like her. Pippi Longstocking, Meg in A Wrinkle in Time, the unnamed but powerful and headstrong girl in The Magic Finger, a Roald Dahl story that was a precursor to Matilda. I clung on because there simply weren’t enough strong girl heroes out there for me, in books or in films, or in real life. I was frustrated by the fact that there was no Jane Bond, no female head of a major company, so few women in the Houses of Parliament. But in my Matilda-like, hopeful, ebullient way, I assumed that the future we were travelling towards would be very different from the present.Now that I’m actually living in that future I have to say the rate of travel has been considerably slower than I expected. The recent photograph of Theresa May creeping behind the massed backs of the suited men of the EU is for me poignant because it is a vivid illustration of how things have not changed as quickly or as radically as that long lost nine-year-old so confidently hoped.We do have far more female heroes in children’s books who dynamically direct the action rather than passively letting it happen to them: Ruby Redfort, Katniss in The Hunger Games, Feo in The Wolf Wilder. In my new book Wizards of Once: Twice Magic, the girl hero, Wish, is the one with the truly great magical powers. My books are read by equal numbers of boys and girls and every time a nine-year-old boy in my signing queue says that his favourite character in my books is a girl, I do an internal high five. Yes! Progress is being made.Adults can learn from children’s lack of prejudice. We can learn from their hopefulness, their endless questioning, and their belief in the impossible. Children are the most creative people in the world, because they don’t know the rules yet. And we’re going to need every single ounce of that creative intelligence to come up with solutions to our current political and scientific challenges. What with one thing and another, the grown-ups have made a gigantic howling mess of things.So go, Matilda, go! Be an inventor, be an explorer, be a brilliant politician (we really, really need one). But stay young, stay obstinate and, for goodness’ sake, stay magic. We need your bravery and your brains and your bright eternal youth.• Cressida Cowell is the author and illustrator of the How to Train Your Dragon and Wizards of Once books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d94a0fd429f56ac56dbdd3ce538746f9dacaea4/0_610_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=982d382b08964727836e1cd51f87e172","title":"politics party conferences reality pointless labour tory","story":"Don’t go to party conferences. Ignore them. They should be banned. When blind loyalty meets crazed dissent fuelled by personal ambition, the result is a disease, a ghastly rash on the body politic. The overheated, hysterical, alcoholic, distorting atmosphere of these events leads to misjudgment – not least by journalists disoriented by being corralled for weeks far from London.After last year’s Tory conference in Manchester, Theresa May’s leadership was pronounced over. Her speech was a disaster, which therefore rendered her unfit to govern. She would be gone by Christmas, certainly by Easter. It was inconceivable she would see another conference, let alone an election. That was the universal “message” of the conference. Suggest she might survive strengthened and you were declared mad.It was always thus. After her catastrophic conference in 1981, Thatcher would be “gone by Christmas”. Her colleagues were lining up to succeed her. On the other hand, Neil Kinnock was a shoo-in as prime minister after his 1991 conference. John Major was to be replaced by Michael Portillo after his 1994 shambles. Tony Blair’s staged conferences supposedly rendered him leader for life. David Cameron could do no wrong after 2015. He was gone in a year.A party conference used to be a rally. It was when activists gathered in one place to reinforce each other’s prejudices. They spoke for other activists and for party members, never for a wider electorate. But whereas loyalty used to be the binding glue of a conference, today it is the opposite. The insecurity of modern leadership has everyone edging around the wall, trying to spot Caesar’s assassins and work out which one to join.May has been handed the toughest task in modern politics. She may not have handled it well – politics is never “handled well” – but she is currently invited by her party critics to deliver to the country an extraordinary act of self-harm, so-called hard Brexit. Decency, commonsense and public interest should surely have her party, of all people, rallying round her, to reinforce her confidence. Yet roars of applause greet the increasingly unhinged Boris Johnson. Senior Tories seem to want to make May’s life a misery. That is what they did to Thatcher. It did not work.Nor does it matter. Voters clearly want a frictionless departure from the EU. That means some version of Chequers, of remaining in the European Economic Area, is unavoidable. Nothing else is practicable. It is therefore very likely that Britain will leave the EU with a deal of sorts next spring. It is also likely that May will lead her party into the next election.This October day, such a prediction seems madness. But then predicting May as still leader seemed madness after last year. That is party conferences for you. They are festivals of madness. Pay no attention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6575c4dfd08dce9385da44044edcfbde1d6caa2a/390_447_7674_4604/master/7674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33c5efb4d7cbae9adb0fdf055c16d06","title":"thomasina miers recipe for tomato and chicken traybake","story":"Be inspired by the gutsy, rich cooking of the MediterraneanI have a friend with an extraordinary kitchen garden in Suffolk. All summer, her many tomato plants have been in their element, with ripe fruit hanging heavily from their branches, wafting their sweet aroma all around.

Roast for a further 25-30 minutes, turning the bread pieces over once or twice.Now make the basil oil, whizzing all the ingredients together. If you want a looser consistency, add a few more slugs of olive oil. Taste and check for seasoning – it will be naturally salty so you may only need the smallest pinch of salt.Once the thighs are golden and cooked through, serve in the baking tray, drizzled with the basil oil, or transfer to a serving dish. Serve with a green salad and perhaps some cheese for pudding.Buy trays of tomatoes at the market at the end of the day and make bottles of passata (always useful) or jars of tomato and chilli jam, which is delicious with grilled vegetables, cheese, sausages and lamb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cb9a4af731a8bc1b275903dcd904025441e2c15/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28b8c29e1213c2bf4a14e673e65b1899","title":"womens super league talking points from the weekends action","story":"Chelsea find the target at last, Cushing under pressure and the underdogs continue to make an impactAfter starting their league campaign with three goalless draws, Chelsea looked more like themselves during their 2-0 win over Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion. Emma Hayes has placed a lot of focus on the Champions League this season and Chelsea’s WSL form has suffered as a consequence. They have rotated a lot and have not found it easy to recover from their midweek exertions in Europe. Yet they had a spring in their step after reaching the last 16 of the Champions League with an emphatic win over SFK 2000 Sarajevo and their strength in depth worked to their advantage against Brighton. There was a start for Fran Kirby after her double against Sarajevo and the forward set Chelsea on their way with a magnificent goal midway through the first half. After starting on the bench against Everton last week, Kirby made a huge difference.Chelsea will be England’s sole representatives in Monday’s draw for the last 16 of the Champions League after Manchester City crashed out against Atlético Madrid last week. That defeat was a big blow for City and their early exit from Europe has left Nick Cushing under huge pressure. It was a hard draw but questions are already being asked about whether Cushing is the right man to lead City forward. The manager has been tasked with bringing European glory to Manchester and losing to Atlético has done him no favours at all. City have been a leading light in women’s football in England but they are seven years into their business plan and there is a sense that things have gone a little stale. What’s next? They didn’t spend as well as Chelsea in the summer and might feel they need some new ideas. That said, they showed good character to recover from two goals down to win 3-2 at Birmingham City this weekend. Don’t write them off yet.The fact that only goal difference is keeping Arsenal above Birmingham at the top of the table shows how tight it has been during the first few weeks. This league is already looking more competitive than ever. The smaller sides are refusing to lie down and Birmingham, Bristol City, Reading have all taken points off Arsenal, Chelsea and City. Of course, the question is whether the unpredictability will last. Perhaps it will start to level out soon, allowing the bigger teams to reassert their dominance over the rest of the field. Yet I wonder if the mentality has changed in the league’s first professional year. The underdogs are playing with less fear. You’re training every day and being treated like a professional. It makes a difference and I wonder if some sides have looked at how Everton struggled to make that transition after becoming professional last season. It took Everton six months to adjust to the greater intensity and tempo of training. It was knackering for six months. Then came the physical rewards. Have teams learned from that and tweaked their workload accordingly? You can never underestimate the benefit of a good pre-season.• The time is right for a WSL revolutionWest Ham have hit the ground running in their first ever WSL season. After running Arsenal close last week, they earned their first ever win at this level thanks to Rosie Kmita’s late goal against Yeovil Town and look like they are going to have a good season. Everyone was waiting to see how good West Ham were going to be – well, they are firing on all cylinders at the moment and much of that is down to hiring Matt Beard as manager. He has so much experience. He won the WSL with Liverpool, he’s a big West Ham fan and he gained valuable experience during his time in the US. He knows where to look and has made some top signings.

Is this season competitive rather than cheap?On Saturday afternoon, leaders Barcelona only managed a 1-1 home draw against 15th-placed Athletic Club Bilbao and had to come from behind for that without a win in three, they dropped their seventh point in six days. On Saturday night, Real Madrid failed to score for the second game running, drawing 0-0 with Atlético Madrid they’ve won just one in four now, while their city rivals left the Bernabéu unbeaten for a sixth successive season but have only won three from seven. And in between those matches, Sevilla beat Eibar at Ipurua, taking them third and on to 17 goals in 10 days, including three against Madrid. Before that, they hadn’t won in three, collecting a solitary point. They hadn’t even scored.On Sunday evening, Alavés had the chance to go joint top with Barcelona, a club with a budget 16 times bigger. It wasn’t just an early-season quirk: since Abelardo Fernández took over 31 weeks before, only Barcelona, Madrid and Atlético had more points. All Alavés had to do now was beat Levante, who’d slipped into the relegation zone without a win in five, but they didn’t: 1-0 up early, another wonderful delivery from Ibai Gómez headed in by Ruben Sobrino, they were beaten 2-1. Led by Rubén Rochina, Levante scored twice before half-time, Jason and Toño García getting the goals. “They were better than us,” Abelardo said. “It’s very difficult to win.”But, you know, La Liga: boring, uncompetitive and all that.Villarreal haven’t won a single game at home this season as for Valladolid, they’ve not lost a single game away. Up late via the play-offs, they spent a total of €2m in the summer, and are two points off a European place. Real Sociedad, Athletic and Valencia are 13th, 14th and 15th. The top four look familiar – Barcelona, Real Madrid, Sevilla, Atlético – and the bottom three are predictable enough – Rayo Vallecano, Huesca, Leganés – but this is not the same as ever. You can see that in the other stats, for a start. The top scorers – André Silva (7) and Christhian Stuani (6) – play for Sevilla and Girona. The man who has completed most passes plays for Betis (Mandi), the man with most successful crosses (Jonathan Silva) is at Leganés, and no one has more assists than Alavés’s Jony – although Lionel Messi has as many.The problem was never so much that Madrid and Barcelona won every league – although a single title won bysomeone else in the last 14 years isn’t great – as the risk that they won them too easily, that they won virtually every game. That’s broken already. Four years ago, one newspaper declared it the “cheapest” league this century because seven games into the season the leaders had 15 points, the lowest total since 1995-96. That autumn, an Atlético player confided: “We can’t win a 100-point league,” but they didn’t need to, which is one reason they won an almost impossible title. Now, four years on, Barcelona are top with 14 points: “Leaders despite everything,” as the cover of Sport put it.Just seven weeks in, no one is winless in Spain and no one is unbeaten . The gap from top to bottom is 10 points – it’s 17 in England – and between them the top three have dropped 23 points, compared to eight in the Premier League, where City, Liverpool and Chelsea have not lost – and four of those points have been dropped among themselves. Expand that to fourth and it’s 31 points dropped in Spain, 14 in England. The Premier League’s top three have 53 points Spain’s top three are 12 points behind.Extrapolate the points totals across the season, and Barcelona would win the league with 76 points. No one has won a league with fewer points since Deportivo de La Coruña in 2000. You have to go back to 2006-07, when Madrid somehow won the most inexplicable, ridiculous title imaginable with 76 points to find anything close. Since then, the champions have collected 87, 99, 96, 100, 100, 90, 94, 91, 93 and 93 points.“Every defeat is an earthquake,” Ernesto Valverde rightly said and yet it’s also the case this time.Real Madrid had impressed early on and were fantastic against Roma, especially, the football better than it had been before. There was a rush on “Ronaldo who?”, Karim Benzema a No 9 again, but efficiency has now plummeted. You have to go back seven years for the last time they went two league games in a row without scoring. Wins against Eyol, Getafe, Huesca and Girona, looked back upon through the prism of now, don’t entirely convince, just as Barcelona’s 2-1 win at Real Sociedad and 1-0 victory at Valladolid don’t, even on that pitch. Julen Lopetegui said his team had dominated Atlético this weekend, and in the second half that was true, but chances were few. In Catalonia, meanwhile, “crisis” has made an appearance. Valverde talked about an “accident”. Once, perhaps twice, maybe but three times? Bluntly, Barcelona have been bad.But while cheap is one word, might competitive be another? Is there something more to cling onto? Although La Liga has tended to be a two-horse race – and became a three-horse race since Simeone arrived back in Spain – it was never purely because the rest were a bunch of donkeys. Between them, Spanish teams have won nine of the last 10 European titles, offering four different winners of the continent’s two competitions. La Liga accounts for four of the top six in the rankings. Villarreal and Celta have been European semi-finalists in the last three years.And things are improving. Economic control, aggressively applied, often resisted, has helped bring stability. Administration and insolvency have almost gone from the top two isions, football’s collective debt to state slowly being paid off: from €600m five years ago to a target of €50m next season. The TV deal is collective now – forced through by the league and enshrined by law because they knew it wouldn’t hold otherwise – and the income is increasing, the gap between the top and the bottom not quite so stark. This summer, Spanish clubs spent almost €900m.The gap is still vast. It is also enormous between England and Spain, the fear of being eclipsed real – that partly drives the determination to take a game to the US – and the financial power of Spain’s “other” clubs remains extremely small. Collectively, Spanish clubs might have spent almost €900m but in net spend it’s well under €100m. Most of the sales, of course, go to England – the Premier League is the threat, but it is also what sustains them in the short-term. When Madrid and Barcelona both lost in midweek, it was the first time that had happened in three years. To take the salary caps as a measure of the imbalances, Barcelona (€632.9m), Real Madrid (€566.5m) and even Atlético (€293m) or Valencia (€164.6m) and Sevilla (€162,7m) are way ahead of Betis (€97.1m), Alavés (€39.1m) and Eyol (€56.7m), let alone Rayo (€38m), Huesca (€29.3m) or Valladolid (€23.8m). And yet Betis, Alavés and Eyol are fifth, sixth and seventh.Leganés are bottom. “It would be lovely if everything became more equal,” said their coach Mauricio Pellegrino. “Normality would be for things to be like they were over 20 years ago. It was more common for more teams to fight it out for the title. But we’re last and we beat the team who’s first – and that’s good news.”Realism says it won’t last, that by the end the same teams will be there – the same teams that already are, in fact. That, forget extrapolating from their results to calculate an 80-point lead, they will accelerate soon, leaving those figures behind. Optimism says that at least it looks a little different already that it might not last but it might as well be enjoyed while it does – and beyond. That at least their journey there won’t be easy. “Every game is a conquest,” Lopetegui said.

Thankfully none were seriously hurt. As the players gathered, trying to help the supporters, Pablo Sarabia turned to an Eibar player and said: “The guy from the league can’t just come and say: ‘They broke it.’” Sadly, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise if that’s exactly what happens.• They’ve got a Scottish goalkeeper and an English centre-back so how the bloody hell are Real Murcia’s opponents supposed to score?

Meanwhile, Málaga are top of the Second Division, after Jack Harper scored again to give them a 1-0 win over Rayo Majadahonda. Continuing this week’s Brit Watch, Patrick Roberts and Nick Blackman came on as second-half subs for Girona and Sporting respectively, and both played well. Up in the first ision, Gareth Bale was off at half-time in the derby and hasn’t travelled to Russia. He’s only expected to be out for a couple of weeks.

But eating spinach, playing videogames and catching coins you’ve thrown in the air could also help What exactly do you want to improve your reflexes for? If it’s for a specific sport, you’re off to a good start. Perhaps you want to be the star goalie at your Thursday afternoon five-a-side, or maybe you have taken up boxing and would prefer not to get hit in the face. The more specific an action, the better. Above all, the cliche holds good: practice makes perfect. Reflexes tend to be an involuntary response, so you need to develop your muscle memory and make those reactions second-nature. If you don’t put the work in, you won’t see any results.Your reaction time is always going to be slower if you’re too tense. Stiff muscles are slower to move. If you have just started sparring in a combat sport, the one tip you will get over and over again is to relax, which can be incredibly difficult when you’re starting out. The aim of the game is to stay relaxed, but alert. Perhaps that means taking some time out to meditate, focusing on your breathing or practising mindfulness – a 2010 study found meditation helped people to perform better in a reaction-timed task.Or at least, that’s according to researchers at Leiden University and the University of Amsterdam. They found subjects who had recently eaten tyrosine, which is found in spinach and eggs, performed better at a reaction-based task than those who hadn’t.Video games may help your reaction speed. A study by scientists from the University of Rochester found that action video games helped people to make the right decisions faster. They also developed a heightened sensitivity to their surroundings.You can use your spare pennies to help speed up those reflexes. Put your hand out with your palm facing the ground and put a coin on top of your knuckles. With your arm outstretched, throw the coin upwards and then try to catch it in the same hand. If that’s too easy, try adding more coins to up the ante.Another invaluable, and inexpensive, tool used to improve reflexes is the humble tennis ball. You can also use a six-sided ball called a reaction ball – although if you can’t find one of those, any bouncy ball will do. All you need is a surface to throw the ball against, with the aim being to catch the thing before it ricochets off into someone else’s back garden. You could also ask a friend to throw it at you while you practise dodging – it’s up to you whether or not you choose a friend with a grudge.A lack of sleep can have a huge effect on reflexes and split-second decision-making. Researchers in California found sleep-deprivation can make you almost as sluggish as a few alcoholic drinks, so make sure you get your eight hours a night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bdd890897c2d101fb7e695c4bc4416a7aaf685/0_250_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8c4745cac3ac542d9d2a088c6791f06","title":"wait buy brexit house prices property","story":"I’m trying to buy a property in Oxfordshire but some friends say I should hold off on the dealQ I am trying to buy a property in Oxfordshire but some of my friends have advised me to postpone any purchase\u0026nbspbecause\u0026nbspof the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspSome people believe property prices will go up while others believe that prices will fall.

Imagine Erykah Badu’s cosmic knowledge exchange delivered in Chance the Rapper’s frank chatter and you’re close, but Noname has an unruffled confidence and wry worldview that is all her own. The boom-bap backings may be pretty but they belie a savage edge, as the Chicago rapper goes in on Uncle Toms and beta males (“The way I lullaby your brokenness, believe me I’m Ripley”). It’s hard to pick a highlight but Ace is an absolute gem, and not just because it shouts out the UK. Two midwest MCs, Smino and Saba, drop by, with the latter almost stealing the show with a domino rally of a verse, words tipping over in an impressively unbroken stream.Let us give thanks as LDR goes into the DGAF phase of her career. Not only is her forthcoming album called Norman Fucking Rockwell but the second single to be taken from it is called Venice Bitch and is nearly 10 minutes long. Her schtick has long involved a love-hate relationship with American iconography, and now she seems to be falling on the side of love – she longs for that Norman-Rockwell-painting life for her and her partner, with the lovely image “on the stoop with the neighbourhood kids  callin’ out bang bang kiss kiss” perhaps the first inkling of their nuclear family. The song earns its length, stretching out into the warm evening in a haze of fuzz guitar and wandering analogue synth tones.The time signature hopscotch of math-rock powers this truly magnificent song, but where that genre often gets bogged down in technicality and bad jeans, Kiran Leonard elevates it to powerful, elegant heights. The prolific songwriter from Saddleworth Moor is only 23 but operating at a seriously mature level, here dissecting the narcissism of internet culture. You can almost feel the weather systems passing across the song, soft breezes in the verses whipping into choppy squalls for the choruses and, with the tearjerkingly powerful guitar solo, an electrical storm of emotion.One of the most anticipated metal releases of the year is I Loved You at Your Darkest by Polish satanists Behemoth, which, if Wolves Ov Siberia and previous single God  Dog are anything to go by, will be symphonically heavy. Where God  Dog used pulverising blast beats and had a video that epically inverted Christ’s crucifixion, Wolves Ov Siberia is more of a rollicking romp. Frontman Nergal roars things like “We hail the flame, we hail the ice  Beyond bosom, beyond materia  We reject! We fucking deny!” while riffs stride confidently across the battlefield.Returning with her first completely solo material since 2010 is pop’s patron saint of heartbreak, with nomy’s Joe Mount co-producing. But while Honey is sung in a trademark melancholy minor key, she’s clearly fed up of being “in the corner  watching you kiss her,” and so on. Instead, Honey drips with sex: “At the heart of some kind of flower  Stuck in glitter, strands of saliva  Won’t you get me right where the hurt is?” Suffice to say, the title doesn’t refer to something you’d spread on toast, unless that’s what you’re into. Be sure to check out our long read on Robyn from last week, too.The best rap of this year has been marked by a willingness to get psychedelic. Travis Scott’s Astroworld, A$AP Rocky’s Testing, Swae Lee’s Swaecation, Playboi Carti’s Die Lit, basically anything involving Young Thug – all have their heads in the clouds, possibly elevated there by some substance. Lil Uzi Vert’s new track is up there with them, hoisted aloft by the remarkable production by Dolan Beats, with a floaty harp melody sampled from anime series Death Parade. Uzi’s lyrics may cleave to cliches about clothes, jewellery and round bottoms but his flow – tumbling forward in a permanent high register – is addictive enough to run towards the six-minute mark.Aviary, the new album from highbrow dream-popper Julia Holter, is nearly 90 minutes long, and sees her head back to the slightly more conceptual, suite-like approach of albums like Tragedy and Loud City Song. But, moth-like, she always circles back to the bright filament of pop. I Shall Love 2 is a big-hearted psych symphony: a trilling, wordless vocal line invites in a whole orchestra, who eventually fill the song to bursting – it pops, and dies away instantly.If you want proof that irony, in the hands of the internet and social media, has modulated into something infinitely complex, just take a look at Jimothy Lacoste. His persona – posh nerd rapper and possible fuckboi – is extremely silly, and yet created with so much deadpan flair that it totally works. It helps that his songs gently slap: following the likes of Getting Busy!, Drugs and Future Bae, Fashion is his best track yet, an ode to his snazzy dressing (“Tucked in shirt, lovely cords”) backed by dreamy G-funk. Is he serious? Best not to ponder it too hard.London songwriter Will Westerman has been knocking around for a couple of years now, leaving swoons and sighs in his wake. The acoustic Mother Song was a breathtakingly sad yet sexy calling card, but, with producer Bullion, he has since added subtle drum machines to create 80s-facing pop balladry. With a doleful voice somewhere between Arthur Russell and Car Seat Headrest’s Will Toledo, on Albatross – the first track from his new EP – Westerman sketches out a series of lazy afternoons, with possible romances hovering around the edges.Along with fellow travellers such as Laurel Halo, Call Super and Minor Science, TJ Hertz, AKA Objekt, has carved out a new space for techno. His music keeps the jaw-slackening (or, depending on what you’re on, tightening) power of 44 beats, but takes in lessons from dub, jazz and psychedelia. The result is a dizzying, intelligent but rambunctious kind of dance music. In the wake of his most commercial moment to date, Theme from Q, comes Secret Snake, another supremely confident and original track. A swaying dancehall-adjacent beat and some subtly kooky vocal samples power the dub techno of the first half, before it explodes into a burst of giant melody."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab6911a36f8dd06b415ce8e201ded059f492c57/0_140_3328_1997/master/3328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ebacedba17a7088d965a0604bd19e8","title":"julie girling pro remain tory mep brexit","story":"Expelled, MEP reveals deeper estrangement from a party that has mostly embraced BrexitThe Conservative faithful are in Birmingham this weekend for the party conference. But Julie Girling, a party member for four decades and member of the European parliament, will not be joining them.Last week the MEP for South West England and Gibraltar learned she had been expelled from the party, after clashing with the leadership over Brexit.It was not a shock. Girling, along with fellow MEP Richard Ashworth, voted last October for a European parliament resolution that the UK had not made sufficient progress in Brexit talks and should not start talks on trade with the EU.The vote was mostly symbolic, only six Tory MEPs were in the chamber, but when the result emerged, the response was swift. One Tory MP said the MEPs had behaved appallingly, while social media seethed with talk of “traitors” and “remoaners”. Girling and Ashworth lost the Tory whip and Theresa May told parliament she had taken action against “the two Conservative MEPs who voted against British interests”. Finally on Tuesday the two rebels were expelled.Girling says: “From a purely personal view it’s extremely upsetting … but I feel so strongly about this that I have had to take this route.”Her vote was never meant as a political statement, she says. “I thought it was fundamentally dishonest to pretend that negotiations have got to the point where negotiations can move to the next level.”After the June 2016 vote, Girling reluctantly supported the leave result that many of her constituents had voted for. But she was soon alienated when May embarked on a policy of leaving the EU customs union and single market – “the hardest possible Brexit”.A turning point was the 2016 party conference, where the prime minister declared that anyone who identified as a citizen of the world was a “citizen of nowhere”, which Girling describes as “that nasty speech”, and then a subsequent speech in which May set out her Brexit red lines. “When she first came out with these red lines I was really astonished,” says Girling, who had expected a softer Brexit to reflect the narrowness of the 52-48 result of the referendum.“I’ve been a member of the party for more than 40 years, and for 38 of those years the party has been pro-Europe. It’s had its difficulties,” she says, recalling John Major’s battles with the Maastricht rebels and David Cameron’s decision to pull out of the mainstream centre-right bloc in the European parliament, the EEP. “Then overnight Mrs May decided ‘we are all Brexiteers now’ and that just is a place I just can’t go.”Brexit has changed the party in other ways, Girling says, emboldening those opposed to tackling climate change Tory MEPs have also voted with Hungary’s ruling party in rejecting EU action to safeguard the rule of law. While there is no Conservative equivalent of Momentum, she predicts “a gradual clearing out of the more moderate conservatives”.Girling joined the Conservative party as a student, starting her career at the carmaker Ford in 1979, the year Margaret Thatcher came to power.Cameron ceded too much ground, she says, to the “the monster that is the Eurosceptic party … He got that completely wrong because the more you chuck them the more they grow.”Girling and Ashworth joined the EPP this year, a move encouraged by continental politicians keen to embrace the symbolism of the British returning to the fold.A fervent support of the people’s vote campaign, Girling thinks a second referendum is the only way to overturn Brexit. She believes the EU would accept an extension of article 50 if the UK was thinking again, but the difficulty is what happens if the UK seeks to stay in the EU beyond European elections in May 2019, requiring the election of British MEPs.In that case, the European elections in the UK could be “a proxy referendum on Britain’s EU membership”, she says, although she believes this is not the most likely scenario.For now, she thinks the prime minister has backed herself into a corner. While many EU diplomats hope May will have room to make compromises after the party conference, Girling is less convinced. “If Theresa May goes to the Conservative party conference and does a load of tub-thumping – which she will – that doesn’t actually free her up afterwards. It makes it worse,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b584906c37d24f48575fbac68df8e25b5c1865d7/0_150_4508_2704/master/4508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2853a1cd12719b4e89db9c1c70b3fcb1","title":"philip hammond vows to stick with austerity in conference speech amazon google","story":"Chancellor also says government may soon have to tax internet firms such as Amazon and GooglePhilip Hammond has claimed the Treasury’s austerity programme will come under attack from “populists and demagogues” among Jeremy Corbyn’s supporters but predicted it would retain the backing of the British people.The chancellor said he would keep back funds to protect the economy should the government fail to secure a Brexit deal and the UK crashes out of the European Union. But he conceded that his plan to be fiscally responsible would be controversial and the Conservative party needed to hold its nerve over the coming months as pleas for extra spending grew louder.Speaking at the Tory conference in Birmingham, Hammond also said the time was approaching when the government would need to tax internet firms such as Amazon and Google, saying: “The global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services.”Hammond said the best way to tax international companies was through global agreements, but added: “The time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a digital services tax of its own.”With only four weeks to go before the autumn budget, Hammond hinted that he would take a cautious approach due to the possibility of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.Backing Theresa May’s Chequers plan for a comprehensive exit deal, Hammond said Europe would remain Britain’s largest trading partner and there was a need for friction-free access to the EU to continue.“That’s why I share the prime minister’s determination to get the Chequers plan agreed.”Nevertheless, he said the government was preparing for the possibility of a no-deal outcome, saying: “And be in no doubt that I will maintain enough fiscal firepower to support our economy if that happens.”Hammond said he was confident a deal would be agreed and predicted this would lead to stronger growth and a “deal idend”.He ramped up the rhetoric against Labour’s spending plans by accusing Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, of promising an “illusory Utopia”.He said while Labour’s answers would solve nothing, their questions deserved a response, “and we must answer their challenges with our own, Conservative solutions based on realism, not populism, delivery, not rhetoric”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76dfc4b3229d3309b0226e777fafd47e37a6b549/694_407_4791_2875/master/4791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0879a6ac90db89d3c3a84b86c93a145","title":"twitter reacts to mays brexit festival plan","story":"Social media users demonstrate scale of the task ahead if the event is truly to reunite UKIt’s fair to say that Theresa May’s announcement that the government is proposing to hold a Festival of Brexit Britain in 2022 hasn’t been universally well received.At the weekend the prime minister said £120m would be spent on hosting the event, which is aimed at marking what May described as a “moment of national renewal”.She said: “Almost 70 years ago the Festival of Britain stood as a symbol of change. Britain once again stands on the cusp of a new future as an outward-facing global trading nation. And, just as millions of Britons celebrated their nation’s great achievements in 1951, we want to showcase what makes our country great today.”Social media users almost immediately leapt on the announcement, demonstrating the scale of the task ahead if the event is truly to reunite the nation.Richard Littler, whose Scarfolk website is a treasure trove of satirical fake public information posters, has created a poster for May’s event, based on the 1951 Festival of Britain original. It captured much of the spirt of the social media response.People were not short of ideas what some of the key attractions could look like:Inevitably comparisons were made with Banksy’s Dismaland theme park:Others recalled the annual news staple of Winter Wonderland attractions that turn out to be anything but wonderful:Steve Bullock, who co-hosts Brexit podcast CakeWatch, produced a long list of possible activities that could be planned for the event, including games of pin the blame on a remainer, workshops on cooking chlorinated chicken and buying unregulated medicine on eBay, and the presence of an innovative jam pagoda.And in the spirit of a more environmentally caring era, there was an excellent suggestion that the venue for the event could be recycled.Labour MP David Lammy described the entire proposal as “historically illiterate”. He said: “The Labour government’s 1951 Festival of Britain marked a new era of growth and international cooperation. The opposite of where this Tory government is taking us.”The proposed date for the festival, 2022, is also the date of the next general election due to be held under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.Some imagined that the queues were already building up in the post-apocalyptic post-Brexit Britain.And some had interesting ideas about the kind of people who might attend.The bleaker humour revolved around the fact that money had been found to hold this festival during an era of austerity-based cuts to the arts.While Mogwai guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, has already definitively ruled out the Scottish band making an appearance.There was speculation about how the event itself might climax.And the creator behind the @Coldwar_Steve account offered their services as creative director.But given the way that he has recently been using newspaper and television interviews to put himself in the frame to replace Theresa May, there was only ever going to be one choice of an official mascot piñata for the event:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b12cb17ede42a3e01b7a1ae5f82aba812c4cb035/0_1131_4046_2428/master/4046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7341b1a093d16619d9599f8d432022d7","title":"staff accuse lambeth council of institutional racism","story":"Group of workers write open letter complaining of racist slurs and unequal treatmentCouncil staff in one of London’s most ethnically erse boroughs have accused bosses of institutional racism, claiming that racial tension is escalating at the local authority with devastating consequences.In a strongly worded letter to councillors in Lambeth, a group of staff who call themselves Lambeth Black Workers write of the “despair, humiliation, disappointments, rejection and loss of staff unity that are direct consequences of racism at work”.“We write to you to impart the reality of daily working life for black staff who work for this borough,” the letter states. A group of around 20 workers ranging from senior to junior staff met to arrange the open letter, the  has learned. They are from various parts of the council, working in housing, environment, social services and finances.The staff call for councillors to intervene, saying they have “exhausted all formal routes”.A Lambeth council spokesperson said: “We take the allegations made within this anonymous letter extremely seriously, and it is essential that staff feel valued and respected and are given the opportunity to be heard.”The deputy leaders of the council, Jennifer Brathwaite and Jack Hopkins, offered to meet staff who had concerns. “We would urge you to raise these allegations through the proper formal channels,” they wrote back.The group agreed to a meeting but said formal channels of complaint were blocked.The staff added: “Institutional racism operates in a much more insidious and often less immediately obvious way to perpetuate racial disadvantage. White job applicants are more successful than black job applicants. White staff tend to progress more readily than black staff. White staff seem to have fewer problems with discretionary management decisions than black staff.”Hassina Malik, an assistant branch secretary at Lambeth Unison, said the results were shocking. “In March 2017 we shared the results of the survey with the councillors and with the chief executive of the council. They agreed it was important to address the problems we had highlighted and said they would engage a third party – someone independent – to look into staff experience of institutional racism and the survey.“More than a year later that person has still not been engaged. The council have reneged on their agreement to investigate and address institutional racism.” She said the situation in relation to race was “seriously escalating”.An anonymous staff member said managers had told her they had “white privilege”, and white colleagues had made it clear black staff members did not belong in certain areas of the building. She said in the eating area there was segregation between white and BAME staff.“I have friends in the council who are white but that is me personally … some white people won’t integrate and the council is fostering that attitude and behaviour. It has got worse since the Brexit referendum. Before that I noticed it was a white versus black thing, but now I can see eastern European people are also being treated badly.” This is not the first time Lambeth council has been accused of institutional racism. In 2003, an eight-month investigation concluded that a key part of the south London authority, which was then Labour-led, had a culture of discrimination, bullying, victimisation, sexual harassment and unprofessional conduct. A Lambeth spokesperson said: “The council is taking a series of measures to improve development and progression for BAME staff and starting ersity awareness and unconscious bias training for managers and staff.”The spokesperson said the council was committed to delivering measures recommended by the Lambeth equality commission, including setting up a leadership programme for BAME staff and new ersity forums to give staff an opportunity to help identify and address equality, ersity and inclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a43f238235d3f5dc7ae3fcfbeebf551c014d3c/0_360_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ec37a62c6ed4c239c78ad6c7b132a7","title":"earl thomas middle finger seattle seahawks nfl leg fracture","story":"The Seattle safety showed his displeasure with his team on Sunday. His reaction shows the importance of NFL contracts ... and the mess the Seahawks are inAnger. It was plastered across Earl Thomas’ face. This was the nightmare scenario for Thomas – and it’s why Le’Veon Bell is currently jet skiing in Miami.Thomas, one of the remaining stars on Seattle’s once-formidable defense, who remains in the midst of a contentious contract dispute with the organization, broke his leg in Arizona on Sunday. The venom practically seeped through the TV screen as he was carted off the field. He glanced towards the Seattle sideline and flipped his middle finger at his own team. It was a justified moment of frustration.It’s not clear who the finger was targeted at, it doesn’t really matter. The 29-year old soon-to-be free agent saw his season end just three games into the campaign. Most likely his career with the Seahawks is done, too. “That’s the crazy part of our business,” star linebacker Bobby Wagner said post game. “If he doesn’t come, then he’s not a team player. If he does come and gets hurt, it’s he shouldn’t have come.”Thomas and the Seahawks have been locked in a fractious relationship for some time. Thomas had held out hopes for a new contract, or a trade to a fresh team willing to pay up. He ended his preseason holdout in time for proper football. He still refused to practice. His gamble: see how much you missed me? And Seattle did. Through three games, Thomas had been at his best the most effective player on the Seahawks defense by some distance. Still Seattle wouldn’t budge. No new deal. No trade. Demands were too high, according to reports.\u0026nbspNow, if he does find a new team, his value on the market is likely to be lower for a player one year older and coming off an injury.It’s tough to kick the stench that something is rotten with the Seahawks. The team’s previously vaunted culture has made way to public standoffs with star players, a steady stream of grouchy leaks, and an overall vibe that could be politely described as disagreeable.They eked by an Arizona side on Sunday that was starting their rookie quarterback for the first time. Previous Pete Carroll Seahawks teams would have feasted. This year’s group looked slow and ponderous on offense. The defense remains a shadow of its former self. The mood, more so than the lack of talent, is what’s so striking. Rarely does a team make so calculated, sweeping business decisions at the cost of its culture.If\u0026nbspreports\u0026nbspare to be believed, general manager John Schneider and Carroll opted to reward Russell Wilson over the slew of defensive players who turned the Seahawks from laughing stock into perennial contenders. That’s fair. The franchise quarterback always wins. The defense was beginning to creak. Guys had aged. Richard Sherman and Michael Bennett were deemed more trouble than they were worth – injuries, age, and culture contributing to the decision. Injuries robbed the team of the back-end of the careers of Kam Chancellor and Cliff Avril, both of whom were forced into early retirement.The juggernaut disintegrated fast. That’s why Thomas wanted his payday. He’d seen the turnover on defense. He knew how far this team was from competing in 2018. The $8.5m base salary remaining on his contract just wasn’t worth it to him. He needed long-term security, lest he succumb to the kind of injury sustained by his former running mates in the backfield, Sherman (achilles) or Chancellor (neck). The Seahawks refused to sign him to an extension this offseason, opting instead to figure-out new deals with receiver\u0026nbspTyler Lockett\u0026nbspand defensive end\u0026nbspFrank Clark. Thomas was incensed.There is no candle that burns more quickly than that of the pro football player. Veteran players understand that. Front offices do too. Two things can be true at once: teams are right to want to minimize the risk of signing players to big-money extensions players, with short careers, are right to want to cash-in and maximize their value when they have the hint of leverage. That’s what makes this thing so brutal. Thomas’s hand was forced. Refuse to line-up, and he’d be hit with the bad-teammate moniker, and lose the money remaining on his current deal. Suit up, and the risks of an awful injury linger over everything, particularly when you play the game the way Thomas does, with an aggression that borders on violent.Thomas’ injury serves as a wicked reminder: the NFL is an unforgiving business. His\u0026nbspmiddle finger pointed at the NFL’s contractual model, as much as the Seattle brain-trust. Thomas will leave when\u0026nbspfree agency opens in March, the\u0026nbsplatest Seahawks stalwart to walk out the door. His market value dinged by his age – 30 – and leg injury.\u0026nbspWagner, who along with linebacker KJ Wright is the only remaining member of those historically great Seattle D’s, summed it up best after the game: “If I was him, I’d be pissed off,” he said.Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Dallas Cowboys. Elliott was his typical self in the run-game, finishing with 152 yards on 25 carries in the Cowboys’ win over the Lions. What was new: Elliott’s impact in the passing game. The former Buckeye has always been an excellent receiver out of the backfield or flexed out wide, yet it seems someone failed to inform the Cowboys’ coaching staff. They finally got the memo. Elliott led the team in receiving on Sunday, too, adding 88 yards and a touchdown to his rushing totals. Dallas still have problems. Elliott isn’t one of them.A microcosm of a funky Bengals-Falcons game. Cincinnati’s walk-off touchdown delivered another heartbreaking loss for the Falcons. Atlanta are the first team since the 1966 New York Giants to score at least 36 points in back-to-back games and, somehow, find a way to lose both. Bad beats seem to be the Dan Quinn way.Atlanta’s defense has suffered early attrition. Replacements haven’t been anywhere near the level of premier starters Deion Jones, Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen, all of whom are out for the remainder of the season. Blown coverages, missed assignments, and a lack of speed have dogged the defense since the trio vacated the line-up the play above sums it up perfectly.Meanwhile, Andy Dalton kept dealing. He currently ranks in the top-seven in quarterback value through four weeks. It’s been that way since the team turned their offense over to Bill Lazor in the middle of last season. The Bengals have found a nice balance of efficiency and explosiveness.Six. That’s the number of touchdown passes Mitch Trubisky threw during Sunday’s win over Tampa Bay. He threw six touchdowns combined in his last 10 games.Trubisky put up the best statistical performance from a Bears quarterback in the Super Bowl era. The how was just as important as the what. Trubisky did an excellent job of playing within the structure of the Bears offense, distributing the ball on-time and in-rhythm to his arsenal of weapons. Not only that, but he showed he could create some magic all by himself, be it with his arm or legs. He never looked flustered.Don’t look now, but this Bears team has a whiff of the 2017 Eagles about them. The defense is smothering. The coach creative. The offense explosive. And they have a young quarterback who has the ability to extend plays and create off-script. At the quarter mark, the Bears have sole possession of first place in the NFC North.“We should fire everybody that was on that field today, starting with me. That was horrific” – Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter.Koetter may be onto something. Firing everyone at this stage of the season seems impractical, but moving on from defensive coordinator Mike Smith makes sense. Smith has been a solid if unspectacular coach throughout his career. His fit in Tampa, however, has always been iffy. Smith’s defense has conceded 48 points twice this season. They entered the game against Chicago as the fourth least efficient defense in the league.-- More teams should get creative with their most athletically gifted players, regardless of positional designations. The Saints continue to find ways to incorporate Taysom Hill into their gameplan. Hill is the team’s Mr Everything: return-man, redzone quarterback, and the man Drew Brees uses to help reveal coverages. Hill, a quarterback in college, even completed a throw off a fake punt on the Saints’ first drive during their victory over the New York Giants. Credit to the Lions, also, who used slot cornerback Jonathan Agnew on offense on Sunday. Get as much speed on the field as possible, that’s the name of the modern NFL game.-- The Patriots avoided their first three-game losing streak since the 2002 season, blowing the doors off the Dolphins. New England have won six straight games after consecutive losses. The average margin of victory in those games: 21.2 points.-- Dallas’s DeMarcus Lawrence finished Sunday with three sacks, three tackles for loss and three quarterback hits. Lawrence is at the peak of his powers right now, the perfect pass-rushing blend of springs and hand usage. A pending free agent, Lawrence will be the No1 target for most teams this coming offseason. Don’t be surprised if he comes close to Aaron Donald’s record-breaking $86m guaranteed deal if he gets to the open market. He’s that good.-- The latest edition of the Fitzmagic experience appears to be over. Fitzpatrick was benched during the Bucs’ blow-out loss at the hands of the Bears. He struggled throughout, heading to the bench at the start of the second-half. Dirk Koetter admitted post-game that Jameis Winston “probably” did enough to regain his starting job for good during his first outing of the season.-- Khalil Mack is deservedly receiving the lion’s share of Defensive Player of the Year attention. His production has been absurd. However, don’t sleep on JJ Watt. The Texans’ pass-rusher is back to his best. He has four sacks in his last six quarters, including two forced fumbles against the Colts on Sunday.-- The Browns scored 40+ points for the first time since 2009. They still lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eec81160434c756ed689b3a388767b6ca55f14ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec5f44cdc596667399060dfa3b7c434","title":"ryder cup 2018 guardian writers pick their standout moments from paris golf","story":"Francesco Molinari was the standout performer while Justin Thomas, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter were among those who also shoneFrancesco Molinari.

Tommy Fleetwood was brilliant too, but Thomas arguably had to do more of the heavy lifting, going 45 for an American team that was struggling and winning tight games against Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm on the Saturday morning – with the help of his partner Jordan Spieth – and Rory McIlroy in the singles. SINot Tommy Fleetwood, sadly, after his collapse in the singles left him with just the four wins with Francesco Molinari. John Rahm was a strong candidate, holding off the flickering challenge of Tiger Woods on Sunday. But Justin Thomas’s fourth point after a dog fight with Rory McIlroy left the most lasting impression of the new boys. KMTommy Fleetwood.

SIThere were many to pick from, but for sheer tension and importance the lead singles on Sunday between Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas was hard to beat. Both made mistakes, both fought for every point all the way to the end – which was tragic for McIlroy when he plugged into a bunker on the 18th when all square. And Thomas was magnanimous in victory to cap off a fine, fighting win. KMIn a parallel universe, Alex Noren v Bryson DeChambeau decides everything.

Think about that. Let it marinate. It is an extraordinary number for an extraordinary success story. Parkrun began 14 years ago this week, with a simple idea: a free five-kilometre time-trial around Bushy Park, south west London. It was low-key, lo-fi, and unofficial. Thirteen people turned up. The results were typed up in a nearby Caffè Nero. No one bothered to ask the park for permission.Now close to 250,000 people do it on a good weekend – across 20 countries, including Russia, Malaysia and Swaziland. The ambition is for that figure to climb to a million. On the evidence so far would anyone dare bet against them?Yet there is another statistic that is even more striking. And it goes some way to explaining why Parkrun has become such a juggernaut. In 2005, the average finish time was 22 minutes and 16 seconds. Last year, having risen every year since then, it was 29:06.It might sound paradoxical, but Parkrun is absolutely delighted that average times have got so much slower. It shows that its guiding ethos of creating an environment that is inclusive – whether the runner is a beginner or an Olympian – is working. It also knows another iron truth: when something is fun people stick with it, even if it takes them an hour to trudge round.Parkrun hears so many stories of people who have not done any physical activity since school who have taken the plunge – many of whom have been conditioned to think sport isn’t for them. Yet time and again it has proven able to reach parts of the population that other sports cannot.Rich or poor, city or rural, the magic formula seems to work anywhere. There are island communities, such as Bressay in the Shetlands who started a Parkrun to get everyone together at the same time each week. Meanwhile in Ruchill – one of the poorest parts of Glasgow with no library, no health centre, gym or chemist – they have established a Parkrun.There are thousands of four-to-14-year-olds who do the 2km junior park run each week. Meanwhile, the oldest regular, John Butcher, is 87, having started his Parkrun journey after he lost his wife on Christmas Day 2016.And it is not just about running. In the past 14 years, 400,000 people have also volunteered – whether it is running an event, high-fiving kids en route, writing reports or taking photographs. It is, truly, the big society in action.Since late June it has also had the stamp of approval from the Royal College of GPs, who have encouraged doctors to prescribe Parkrun for overweight patients and those with some health conditions as an alternative to medication. Already 400 GP surgeries have signed up to become certified Parkrun practices.Yet there are some in sport who are privately sniffy about Parkrun, because they believe it is merely for ‘fun’ runners. They would be better served trying to work out how to absorb its lessons. Remember too that Parkrun is able to get results with a small budget and only a couple of dozen staff. Public bodies such as Sport England, which invests millions of pounds each year into grassroots sport, would love a success story as massive as Parkrun.There is a challenge here for UK Athletics as well. Because there is an obvious disconnect between the social casual runner and the elite levels of the sport. Grassroots football and rugby players identify with top Premier League and Premiership stars – so one would think it would be a given that most Saturday morning park runners would consider themselves as athletes, and want to watch and attend track events. Yet that does not seem to be the case.That said, Parkrun is a gateway for some to become more serious about the sport, with around 8,000 runners a year subsequently joining an affiliated running club after starting Parkrun. If average membership fees are around £15 a year, that’s £120,000 being put into the sport each year.But speaking recently to Parkrun’s chief executive, Nick Pearson, he emphasised the biggest mission of the organisation was to get more people involved – especially “in areas of social deprivation where the free market has left people behind and there is a lack of provision for physical activities”.He added: “Our ambitions are both modest and huge in the sense that we want to make a greater impact in making more people healthier.”They have certainly made an incredible start. It has became a place to meet your mates and new friends. To get off the couch and to get most of your 10,000 steps done for the day. And yes, to beat your personal best.Too many times sport is reduced to being about winners and losers. But Parkrun illustrates the vital benefits of thinking fast and slow. Long may it thrive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac6c8b67d2cd628015f30b21925c9602eee109fe/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c99b0b1514b44616469d5359f150a8a","title":"rugby union talking points from the premiership weekend action","story":"The high-scoring extravaganzas should be enjoyed while they last but it seems nobody will get anywhere near the top twoWe know it will not last once the winter bites, but this has been quite the September if a points frenzy is your thing. This match was the highest scoring yet, although its 85 points register as only joint 24th on the chart of highest-scoring Premiership games. If we count only those that finish within a score, it comes in at fourth. Even the Kiwis seem impressed. Todd Blackadder the other week was resigned to the need just to score more than the opposition. This week Chris Boyd bemoaned the defence but accepted that when players look for space they are capable of finding it. Michael AylwinHarlequins moved up to fourth after their away win against a Gloucester side who would have frustrated the Shed, so prescriptive was their play. Quins’ next fixture is at home against Saracens on Saturday night. The champions have spent the past two weekends sending opponents who started the round in fourth place, Gloucester and Bath, scuttling down the table and Quins, never mind their first away league win for a year, are in similarly fickle form. But they have won their past three home league fixtures against Saracens and are developing some backbone. Paul ReesAfter a poor, nervy contest much of the post-match discussion revolved around two players who were not involved. Sale have revealed their South African scrum-half Faf de Klerk will be available to the club throughout the autumn international period, with an agreement having been reached with the Boks for the No 9 to remain in the southern hemisphere during the spare weeks in the Rugby Championship. With their game against England also falling outside the official Test window, Premiership Rugby regulations are also set to sideline other English-based Boks such as Willie Le Roux and Francois Louw for the Twickenham date. Leicester, meanwhile, might not risk recalling Manu Tuilagi for the game against Northampton this weekend. Tuilagi’s hamstring ruled him out of England training last week – “There wasn’t really much point in him getting in the car with a tight hamstring to go down and stand around on the sidelines,” said Geordan Murphy – and a return against the Saints is not yet certain. “It’s a question of whether or not he’s ready to roll next weekend, whether or not we need to use him or whether we rest him for another week,” Murphy said. Robert KitsonThree home defeats from three is a run of form that would ordinarily be of concern for Newcastle until you consider their opponents have been the Premiership’s top three sides from last season. The defeat by Wasps on Friday will have hurt most, having been ahead with 10 minutes to go but the Falcons still have plenty about which to be optimistic. Sinoti Sinoti was at his mesmeric best against Wasps and Johnny Williams at inside-centre is further demonstration of Dean Richards’s canny recruitment. They have already won once on the road this season and their ability to do so last term was a fundamental part of their run to the semi-finals. On Saturday they go to Sale. Gerard MeagherTodd Blackadder made 13 changes for the trip to Saracens and tasked his side with trying to come away with a losing bonus point. He argued his point by saying that “otherwise we’ll just end up playing our best team every single week and we’ll end up breaking guys”. The Rugby Football Union, Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Players’ Association will soon announce the finer details of how the domestic season will fit around the global calendar from 2020 onwards. Perhaps that will give a clue as to whether Blackadder’s approach to this game becomes a trend. Gerard MeagherA third successive Rugby Championship for New Zealand with room to spare but the Pumas produced one of the more infuriating performances in recent memory. Their scrum – once the bedrock of Argentinian rugby – was marmalised and they coughed up the ball on their lineout five times. If they can get their set-piece firing though, they will be a World Cup force to be reckoned with.The Connacht prop Dominic Robertson-McCoy is facing a lengthy ban for a horrible stamp to the head of Leinster’s Josh van der Flier. It earned him a red card as well as widespread condemnation following Leinster’s 20-3 victory and the Connacht coach Andy Friend at least acknowledged: “That wasn\u0027t good and Dom is really disappointed with himself.” That may be so but the authorities must send a strong message with a firm sanction.Huge credit must go to Nigel Owens for his intervention when Benetton’s Engjel Makelara tried to return to the field after it emerged his head injury assessment had not been carried out properly. Makelara attempted to come back on against Edinburgh seven minutes after initially going off but Owens questioned his return with medics from the Italian side.

She was interviewed on Sunday.When Ramirez spoke to FBI agents, she detailed her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of a confidential investigation.The person familiar with Ramirez’s questioning, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Ramirez also provided investigators with the names of others who she said could corroborate her account.Another Yale classmate came forward, meanwhile, to accuse Kavanaugh of being untruthful in his testimony to the Senate judiciary committee about the extent of his drinking in college.In his statement released on Sunday, Charles “Chad” Ludington, who now teaches at North Carolina State University, said he was “deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale”.Ludington said he was a friend at Yale, when Kavanaugh was “a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker”.“On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,” Ludington said.While saying that youthful drinking should not condemn a person for life, Ludington said he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s statements under oath.In that Senate judiciary committee hearing last Thursday, the first woman to accuse Kavanaugh, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, detailed the attempted rape she said happened at a house party in 1982. Ford has not been contacted by the FBI since Friday, according to a member of her team.On Monday morning Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for another woman who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, Julie Swetnick, said his client had not been contacted either.He added: “Be clear: 1. I CANNOT just walk my client into an FBI office. We tried that. They claim they don’t have jurisdiction and they refuse to take a stmt. 2. While we may file a criminal complaint, that will have no bearing on any vote due to timing. We will proceed with other options.”Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all the accusations.The White House insisted it was not “micromanaging” the one-week FBI investigation, which Trump ordered at the behest of Arizona senator Jeff Flake, after the Senate panel voted on party lines to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination.As Democrats claimed the White House was keeping investigators away from certain witnesses, Trump tweeted that no matter how much time and discretion the FBI was given, “it will never be enough” for those trying to keep Kavanaugh off the bench.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told Fox News on Sunday that White House counsel Don McGahn “has allowed the Senate to dictate what these terms look like, and what the scope of the investigation is”.“The White House isn’t intervening. We’re not micromanaging this process. It’s a Senate process.”A Senate judiciary committee member, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said testimony would be taken from Ramirez and Judge, who has been named by two of three women accusing Kavanaugh. Judge has denied the allegations or said he does not remember the events described.“I think that will be the scope of it. And that should be the scope of it,” Graham told ABC’s This Week.Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the judiciary committee, called on the White House and the FBI to provide the written directive regarding the investigation’s scope. In a letter on Sunday, she also asked for updates on any expansion of the original directive.Susan Collins of Maine, a key vote when Kavanaugh’s confirmation comes to the floor, said she was confident in the investigation and “that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews”.Republicans control 51 seats in the Senate and cannot afford to lose more than one vote. Collins and Flake spoke throughout the weekend. Senate Republicans discussed the investigation with the White House late on Friday, according to a person familiar with the call not authorized to discuss it publicly.Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s office declined to elaborate, reiterating only that the investigation would focus on “current credible allegations”.Democratic senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a judiciary committee member, doubted how credible the investigation could be, given the time limit.“That’s bad enough,” she told ABC. “But then to limit the FBI as to the scope and who they’re going to question, that … I wanted to use the word farce, but that’s not the kind of investigation that all of us are expecting the FBI to conduct.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d0879a4b28e4b349b4572aee50fbbaec52761e/0_183_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca132fd0f618a442dc9f8eac6f5d480","title":"result of macedonia referendum is another victory for russia","story":"Western leaders offered closer integration but they were outmanoeuvred by MoscowThe refusal of Macedonia’s voters to endorse a change in their country’s name seems, at first glance, to be a matter of purely local interest. But the result of Sunday’s referendum will be widely seen as a significant victory for Vladimir Putin, a setback for the EU and Nato, and another disturbing example of Russia’s ability and willingness to influence the democratic process in western countries.Increased instability and ision suit Russia’s game plan, according to western analysts. If the referendum had been successful, it would have resolved a dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia’s route to EU and Nato membership. As elsewhere in the western Balkans, notably Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, Moscow is determined to prevent further expansion of western influence.For students of the 2016 US presidential election, Russia’s methods in Macedonia look highly familiar. Disinformation campaigns and “fake news”, cyberwarfare and hacking, phoney Facebook and Twitter accounts and secret cash payments – the modern equivalent of communist-era “red gold” – are all alleged to have been used.Russia denies interfering. But western diplomats claimed last month that 40 new posts a day were appearing on Facebook encouraging a referendum boycott. Postings asked “are you going to let Albanians change your name?” – a blatant attempt to stoke tensions with majority-Slav Macedonia’s ethnic Albanian minority.In one incident, football supporters opposed to the name change fought police in Skopje. Some later admitted they had been paid to cause trouble by shadowy figures. A photograph was circulated on social media showing the bruised face of a popular singer. It falsely claimed she had been beaten by police.Mattis’s attempt to bolster the yes vote, backed by $8m in US congressional funding, were complemented by visits by Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Britain’s Foreign Office reportedly provided referendum funds.All sought to assure Macedonians their future security and prosperity were best served by closer integration with the west. But they were out-thought, outspent and outmanoeuvred by Moscow.Russia’s meddling extended to northern Greece, where four diplomats were expelled in July for trying to inflame anti-Macedonian sentiment in Thessaloniki. In 2016, Moscow was accused of trying to mount a coup in Montenegro to prevent it from joining Nato.As elsewhere in Europe, Russia’s influence campaign in Macedonia exploited and complemented rightwing nationalist-populist narratives based on notions of identity, race and the perceived threat of an overbearing EU.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Presidential candidate and Independent Senator Joan Freeman did not donate her Seanad salary to the suicide prevention charity she founded, Pieta House, as she pledged to do.Ms Freeman was appointed to the Seanad in May 2016, as one of then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s 11 nominations to the Upper House. She was nominated by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, under a deal where the opposition leader chose three appointments.Shortly after her nomination, Ms Freeman stated she would donate her €66,277 salary from the role to Pieta House, where she had served as chief executive until the end of 2014.Ms Freeman instead donated €41,000 to Solace House, a separate New York-based charity she set up in 2015. A spokeswoman for Ms Freeman said the donation amounted to her full Seanad salary “after tax and pension deductions, which Ms Freeman was obliged to deduct”.The US charity first started as a pilot in 2015, launched by Pieta House Ireland. Financial statements from Pieta House state the US service would be an arm\u0027s length domestic not-for-profit corporation incorporated in New York. The project was initially funded by a €72,258 grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs. *In a May 2016 Facebook post, Pieta House congratulated Ms Freeman on her Seanad appointment, and said it was “proud and supportive of Joan’s decision to give the whole salary that goes with the role of Senator back to our life-saving service”.Commenting at the time on donating her salary Ms Freeman said “I was appointed a Senator because of Pieta House so it’s only right that Pieta House and the community benefit as a result of this”.The charity provides help and support to people suffering from suicide ideation or who self-harm, and organises the annual Darkness into Light fundraising walk.Solace House is a counselling charity set up to offer support services to the Irish diaspora.Ms Freeman has donated her Seanad salary to the American charity from May 2016 to December 2017, a spokeswoman said. The charity was first incorporated as Pieta House Inc as a pilot programme, before it was named Solace House.Separately, Pieta House has warned staff and volunteers to avoid wearing charity branding if canvassing during the presidential election.The charity recently sent an internal note to staff and volunteers warning that their support of any election candidate should not be “associated in any way with the employee’s or volunteer’s work at Pieta House”.The note warned the “employeevolunteer must also not wear clothing or have materials that would lead the public to believe that the person is representing Pieta House”.“Confusion in the minds of the public could pose a risk to the charitable status of Pieta House. The consequences for Pieta House, should it be in breach of charities law, would be extremely serious,” the memo stated.In a statement to The , Ms Freeman said she “absolutely” agreed with the guidelines issued by the charity.“In the early stages of my campaign, I became aware members of the team had contacted Darkness into Light volunteers seeking support for my nomination by using my mobile phone contacts. As soon as I became aware of this I issued an instruction not to do so,” she said.* This article was amended on October 1st, 2018 to provide more detail.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireThere are exactly six months to go before Britain leaves the EU. With time running out to reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May is confronted with the choice she has tried to avoid since becoming prime minister: retaining unfettered access to European markets or bolstering the UK’s autonomy.The EU has given Britain until mid-October to strike a deal that will avoid creating a hard border with Ireland – the biggest remaining obstacle in the orce talks.But the two sides also have to come to an initial understanding on Britain’s long-term relationship with the bloc, which could determine the country’s trajectory for decades.The challenge for the prime minister is to find a solution acceptable both to Brussels and the House of Commons that will achieve an orderly Brexit and reduce the uncertainty hanging over business and the economy.For months she has sought to square the circle with her so-called Chequers proposal, under which Britain would follow the EU’s rule book for goods trade, but go its own way on services and the free movement of people.But Chequers is opposed by some 60 Conservative MPs and the opposition Labour party. European leaders at this month’s Salzburg summit also objected to it as cherry-picking that could allow the UK to undercut Europe’s stringent regulations.Here are the remaining options open to the UK and the EU – their prospects for resolve the Irish border question their likely economic consequences and their chances of success.EEA membership would ensure that goods and services sold in Britain were automatically free to be sold in the rest of the EU. Britain would need to align with European rules for goods and services.To ensure frictionless trade – avoiding customs declarations for goods at ports – the UK would need to retain membership of a customs union with the EU, precluding separate trade deals with other countries.Many advocates of this option see this as an interim, medium-term phase until technology can resolve Irish border issues.George Yarrow, chair of the Regulatory Policy Institute and emeritus fellow of Hertford College, Oxford, has long favoured this stepping stone route for Brexit. “In the long run, a customs union is a seriously inhibiting factor for the UK as a global trading nation,” he said.Solved as long as the UK remains in a customs union.This is the least damaging form of Brexit. The government estimates that there will be a hit of 1.6 per cent of GDP to the economy once customs barriers are erected, but this will be significantly less – 0.5 per cent – if Britain stays in the customs union. The government also estimates that there would be no detrimental effect to public finances.The EEA option would be acceptable in Brussels. It has some support in both the Labour and Conservative parties. But it is not acceptable to Mrs May because it would violate her red lines on three issues: European courts having a role in Britain freedom of movement and the ability to strike trade deals ahead of leaving the EU customs union.A customs union with the EU would give the UK autonomy over its services, which comprise 80 per cent of the economy, while keeping its membership of the single market in goods and agriculture. Border issues would be resolved but almost all free trade agreements with other countries would be prohibited.The withdrawal of Britain from the single market in services would be a hit to the economy. The OECD estimates that services trade barriers within the EU are four times smaller than those between the EU and non-members.Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that a middle way “guarantees a reasonable level of trade access to the EU” but there would be costs in “continuing uncertainty over the trading relationship for some time”.The government has not produced an exact estimate of the costs, but its models suggest a long-term cost of 3 per cent of GDP from the gradual ergence of services regulationA possible compromise but unlikely to satisfy many people. Theresa May would balk at the membership of a customs union Brexiters would complain of their inability to strike trade deals and the common regulation of goods Brussels would see a British attempt to cherry pick the single market. This would be tough to negotiate.The hard Brexit option. The UK would have autonomy to set its own regulations, and its immigration and trade policies. There would be no tariffs between the UK and the EU, but there would be significant non-tariff barriers from customs and regulatory checks at borders.Julian Jessop, chief economist of the Institute of Economic Affairs, who supports this option, accepts that there would be costs. “Trade with the EU will not be as frictionless as now,” he said.He stressed that it is much easier to measure costs of a policy than its longer-term benefits, but he believes there are many potential gains for Britain from autonomous regulations and trade policy.“An FTA is the combination that has the best chance of minimising the additional costs and maximising the potential benefits,” he said. “I can’t say with a high degree of confidence whether this is definitely better or worse than the current relationship as an EU member. But this action would give us the best possible chance”.Would require a technological solution, which is currently unavailable, or agreement that Northern Ireland would have a different customs regime and separate goods regulations from the rest of the UK.The vast majority of economists suggest this would be the most painful form of Brexit: additional trade barriers would be large while potential benefits of trade deals with the US and other countries would be small.The government model suggests a long-term hit to the economy of just under 5 per cent of GDP. Most other estimates are in a similar range. The IEA is an outlier. It calculates net benefits of up to 7 per cent of GDP, once many trade deals had been signed and what they call improved regulation are introduced.Acceptable to Brussels, so long as Britain agrees to the Irish backstop, under which there is no hard border iding the island of Ireland, and to many Brexiter-Conservatives. However, it is unacceptable to Mrs May, on the grounds that the Irish backstop would tear apart the integrity of the UK.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Win McNameePoolReuters I never thought it could be as brutal.The same Republican gargoyles who once tore Anita Hill limb from limb knew they had to tread gingerly, with women at the barricades. They outsourced the estrogen to “a female assistant,” as Mitch McConnell called Maricopa County sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell.And race, which scorched the Hill-Thomas hearings, was not a part of this excruciating face-off. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh were summoning memories of summer days in the very white, very cosseted country club, prep school world of suburban Washington.But, shockingly, it was more brutal.Not only because the sexual transgression Blasey Ford was describing was more savage. But also because Kavanaugh simply adapted Clarence Thomas’s playbook of raging against the machine. Thomas’s fury was white-hot. Kavanaugh’s weepy. But the pitch was the same.“This is a circus,’’ Thomas seethed in 1991.“This is a circus,’’ Kavanaugh seethed on Thursday.Kavanaugh echoed Thomas’s martyrdom, claiming he was being “destroyed” by partisans conspiring to dig up dirt. He charged that Democrats were conducting a “grotesque and co-ordinated character assassination” because of their anger about President Donald Trump’s ascent and their desire for revenge after his own seamy work helping Ken Starr in his pervy pursuit of Bill Clinton.It was a cri de coeur custom-made for the age of Trump – and custom-designed to please Trump himself: entitled white men acting like the new minority, howling about things that are being taken away from them, aggrieved at anything that diminishes them or saps their power.As the Atlantic noted, Kavanaugh brandished Yale as “a magic wand, something that could be waved to dispel questions of his conduct”.Thomas prevailed over Hill because of that lava flow of anger. The senators were frozen, Pompeii-style, as he cried racism to snatch the mantle of victim.Hill’s aloof, dispassionate description of Thomas’s harassment, and her preternaturally cool reaction to all the lurid slanders hurled at her, left the senators skeptical that she was telling the truth shouldn’t a wronged woman show more emotion?Six years later, when Hill wrote a book, the law professor explained that, as the youngest of 13 from a rural Oklahoma family, she had had years of practice in “being impervious to and immobile in the face of hurt”.Hill’s mother was left to express the emotion that her daughter reined in when the Senate confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court, the mother snapped, “The dirty rascals.”Hill seemed so poised and polished at 35, you had to remind yourself that she was a less-assured 25-year-old personal assistant when Thomas spewed his talk about bestiality and porn stars’ anatomies. But there was no need to remind people on Thursday that the dignified professional woman at the witness table was describing something from 36 years ago.The Palo Alto psychology professor laced her testimony with scientific terms like “sequelae,” “norepinephrine” and “hippocampus”. But it was easy to visualize the 15 year old in the 51-year-old with the girlish voice and guileless air as she repeatedly pushed a blond strand of hair out of her face, smiled nervously and tried oh so hard to please everyone. Her emotions, including panic, seemed close to the surface.The pentimento of the teenage Blasey Ford made her seem achingly vulnerable. Like Hill, she had a purity to her manner and story that was luminous, an impressive contrast to all the dark obfuscations, self-serving political manoeuvring and petty deceptions around her.Kavanaugh had seemed to dissemble a few times in his earlier testimony, including about his role in the case of the stolen Democratic documents in the Bush years and his role in the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping programme.And he appeared to do so again on Thursday, pretending the “Renate alumnius” in the Georgetown Prep yearbook was an affectionate term for his “great friend” who called the innuendo “horrible, hurtful and simply untrue”. He said the vomiting that gained him entry to the “Beach Week Ralph Club” was about spicy food more than drinking. Right. Again treating the senators like idiots, he provided innocent meanings for clearly salacious terms used like “Devil’s Triangle”.The nominee whom Ted Cruz defended as “a boring boy scout” became a sneering portrait of privilege denied.When Amy Klobuchar, citing her father’s alcoholism, asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he snapped back, “I don’t know – have you?’’Jeff Flake was so unnerved by the blast of opposition to his decision to vote for Kavanaugh that he led a scheme to get a week’s delay to have the FBI investigate.So we will finally drag Mark Judge, the man named by Blasey Ford as the third person in the room that night, out of his beachfront hideout. If the Republicans wanted to discern the character of who they’re putting on the court, rather than simply solidifying the conservative majority, they would already have subpoenaed Judge and anyone else who could provide clarity.The hope that the FBI will save the day may be misplaced. In the case of Anita Hill, agents were deployed by Republicans to help smear her.Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, he already seems warped by this experience – just like Thomas was, when he went on to the bench as a very angry and bitter man.But at least we have a few more days to pretend to look for the truth."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

The first told him that he had recently been released from prison after a stint for armed robbery. Mr Macron told him to “stop troublemaking”, adding: “Your mother deserves better.”He then posed with the second young man, bare-chested with baggy trousers, who later posted the picture on social media where it was picked up back in mainland France.“Words fail to express our indignation. France deserves better that this. It’s unforgivable,” tweeted Ms Le Pen, head of the National Rally, RN, previously the Front National. “What an affront to France by the man supposed to preside over our fate with dignity and nobility! A finger and a smile,” added fellow RN figure Jean Messiha.Valérie Boyer, an MP from the mainstream Right-wing Republicans: “You must behave properly. You’re not called Manu (diminutive of Emmanuel), you’re called Mr President.”Quizzed on the photo before leaving the French Caribbean, Mr Macron sought to play it down.Mr Macron has come under fire for the photograph“The reason why I fought to be elected against Marine Le Pen and why I’m here today is because I love each and every child of the Republic,” he said to applause.“He didn’t choose the place he was born and he didn’t have the opportunity not to (make trouble)”.Mr Macron said that after the photo was taken, the two young men had help carry a handicapped girl who wanted to meet him. “They were able to do that because I looked at them with trust, because I respected them. That’s the Republic.”The snap sparked furious exchanges on social media.Many accused Ms Le Pen of double standards. One posted a picture of her posing with a former SS officer, saying: “That’s unforgivable”.  Another showed her smiling next to two neo-Nazis.The row came a day after Mr Macron sought to strike a new, more humble tone after a string of political setbacks and record low approval ratings.“I’m not perfect. No one is perfect,” he told Le Journal du Dimanche. “So it’s normal that there have been things that were not done well. They have to be corrected.”Widely accused of being haughty, including by senior figures in his own centrist camp, Mr Macron said he wanted to reconnect with the public. “I am happy to be with people. I like contact, being among them,” he said. “I want to get back into a field that can be difficult . . . It can mean accepting people’s anger, impatience and distress.”After a dazzling start, Mr Macron’s presidency has hit severe turbulence at the start of its second year.After a summer scandal involving his security aide, his star environment minister resigned due to lack of progress and Gérard Collomb, the powerful interior minister, slammed his “hubris and lack of humility”.The president’s attempts at rolling up his shirtsleeves to meet the public has landed him in trouble on several occasions, most recently two weeks ago when he told an unemployed gardener that all he had to do was “cross the street” to find work in a café or restaurant. With an approval rating of around 30 per cent, Mr Macron is now less liked than his deeply unpopular predecessor, François Hollande.On Sunday, he said he was aware that the French were starting to get impatient due to the lack of tangible effects of his reforms on their daily lives, but insisted that unlike his predecessors, he would press ahead with more changes.“In no way will I change policy,” Mr Macron said. “I undertook transformations that our country avoided for decades.”Please review our commenting policyConservative Party conference day two live: Dominic Raab says UK will listen to

plans to secure food supply in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But he said it was “wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling”, indicating that industry would need to take the lead.Speaking as Aldi unveiled its annual results, Mr Hurley said the grocer does not yet have a “detailed” Brexit plan due to lack of clarity on the deal.Cadbury stockpiling chocolate to prepare for

down fears that a shortage of EU workers could hit UK businesses.“We\u0027re very confident because we have market-leading pay rates that if there were any problems we\u0027d be fairly insulated from that,” he said.Aldi on Monday confirmed growth plans for the UK, targeting 1,000 stores by 2022.Mr Hurley said new stores could include sites left empty by collapsed retailers such as Toys R Us and Poundworld, or disposals made as part of the Sainsbury\u0027s merger with Asda.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

That still puts the company at a higher price-to-earnings multiple than its only other listed rival Ferrari\u0026nbspwhich has a stronger history of making profits.Shareholders will be cashing out just five months before Brexit which could usher in damaging trade barriers for the UK car industry.Aston Martin moves ahead with stock market float as Volvo shelves IPODespite the price reduction, some existing shareholders will have seen a 10-fold increase in their investment in less than a decade. When private equity firm Investindustrial bought a 37.5 per cent stake in 2012, Aston Martin was valued about £400m.Car manufacturers are expected to be among the hardest hit by Brexit, because they rely on hundreds of parts sourced from across the Continent. Industry figures have warned that any delays at the border or other additional administrative burdens could prove disastrous.But chief executive Andy Palmer said last month that Aston is “well insulated” from problems that could result from the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal.“We can demonstrate that Brexit is not a major effect for us,” he said.“If there is a tariff into Europe, it’s countered by a tariff into the UK for our competitors so you might lose a little bit of market share in the EU but you pick it up in the UK.”Aston Martin sells roughly 25 per cent of its cars to the EU and operates its only plant in Britain, with a second one due to begin operations in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The CBI director general is moderate, sensible and well liked. She does a fine job of putting her members’ case, both in public and behind the scenes. \u0026nbspYet for doing this - for putting forward the views held by the majority of the business community - she finds herself pilloried by the Brexiteer right as a treasonous hellspawn demon who doesn’t “believe in Britain” and doesn’t understand business like they do.\u0026nbspYou can understand Ms Fairbairn’s appeal for a “change in tone” this morning. The organisation that arguably serves as the principle voice of business would really like to be able to do business with the current Conservative Government.

One of the parents’ initiatives was an annual pantomime.At a script-writing session, held in someone’s kitchen, our host, then a senior BBC executive, said “why don’t we do this the BBC way?”That consisted of coming up with ideas, and every one we thought worth pursuing would be written on a Post-it and stuck on the wall. Fair enough.After three hours, we’d... covered the wall with Post-its. Our efforts to filter out the duff parts, lines and jokes had come to nothing. If anything we were left with an array of stickie labels, more baffling and complex than anything committed to an actual notebook.I was prompted to think on this, when I read a new study by my good friend, Christopher Saul. Once a top-of-the-tree lawyer, advising many top corporations, Chris went on to become senior partner at his City firm, Slaughter and May. The Slaughters rule is that at the end of their term the senior partner must leave entirely - to stop the successor having to worry about the former senior partner second guessing decisions.Today, Saul is no longer a solicitor but runs his own practice, Christopher Saul Associates, specialising in mediating in business disputes, helping sort out succession issues, and putting companies and organisations right about their governance structures and processes.It’s in that regard that he’s produced a report, The Governance Paradox, analysing the UK’s new Corporate Governance Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council.The first version of the UK Corporate Governance Code, or the Code, as it’s widely known, was published in 1992 by the Cadbury Committee. After a series of major scandals, it was the first serious stab at bringing companies, particularly publicly listed ones, into line, to making them comply with a set of principles, and their accompanying detailed provisions, covering the composition of boards and accounting.Since then the Code has been revised, updated and expanded, with the latest version appearing this summer for implementation in January next year. The new Code is intended to reflect more the age in which we live and in which companies operate, and also comes on the back of further corporate collapses and crises where shareholders, employees, creditors and other stakeholders were seen to suffer.Companies are being required to be seen to be upholding proper, decent values, to devote more attention to their purpose, to their management culture, to pursue ersity, to be more open and inclusive in how they conduct themselves, to pay heed to the interests of their stakeholders, and to focus on the sustainability of the business.The Code is intended to be “shorter and sharper”, according to the FRC. Now Saul is an urbane, thoughtful chap, not given to hyperbole - as you might expect from the ex-senior partner of such an eminent law firm. So, when he says he agrees with that view, but “it clearly increases to a material extent the governance burden on the boards of premium listed companies” - hence “the paradox” in his title - this should set off alarm bells.It’s true, that we want to tackle the decline in public trust in business, prompted to a large part by instances of perceived greed and fat cattery, but we have to be immensely careful. As Saul asks: “Will the higher hurdles and increased disclosures lead to better outcomes? Or will they lead to exactly the box-ticking and pro-forma compliance which the FRC is looking to avoid?”Let me ask another question: when did you last peruse a company annual report? The current crop, thanks to the existing myriad reporting requirements, are hideously long, complex affairs. The governance section alone of a report for one of the larger FTSE100 members is a document worthy of a PhD dissertation in itself. BP’s annual report, for instance, runs to 299 pages - 53 of which concern how the oil company is governed. Tesco‘s, by contrast, is a relatively slim 155 pages, but the retailer still takes 41 pages to explain who sits on its board, what they do, and how much they’re paid.These are giants that can well afford the attendant advisors that produce these vast tomes. Even a much smaller concern like fashion chain Ted Baker, for instance, is obliged to weigh in with an annual report of 122 pages, including 42 pages devoted to governance matters.The FRC is seeking higher quality reporting, but unfortunately the experience to date, in a City heavily populated by lawyers and accountants is to equate quality with quantity. As there’s been a push to raise standards, so have reports become ever bigger.This begs two questions. Will it see more public-owned companies decide they’ve had enough, and choose to go private - this, at a time, when the private equity houses are flush with cash and sniffing for purchases? And, at the very least, will it force non-executive directors to think again? Saul summarises these queries in another: “Have we arrived at governance overload?”By all means lift the bar where corporate behaviour is concerned - we’ve seen far too many examples of appalling executive disdain for others, examples that have done huge harm to how big business in Britain is regarded. But we also need to re-examine what we’re asking of our companies, to see if every item in the Code is necessary, and whether the workload it’s imposing, and the sheer detail (not to mention the pagination) cannot be reduced. We may think we’re moving towards better administration and management of our businesses, when in fact all we’re doing is creating yet more work for lawyers and accountants. As a former leading lawyer himself, Christopher Saul is well-placed to judge.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firm.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Not small firms…But in the past in my two previous restaurants, when I’d posted about any social impact activities I’ve undertaken – be it hiring ex-offenders or going to west Africa to help girls in a slum dwelling set up their own businesses – I’ve been questioned about my motives in publicising what I’ve done. To some, the post becomes a boast.I’ve carried on regardless, not least because over time I’ve found our customers actually like the fact that we do stuff with the money they spend with us other than just line our pockets. I wish more people would do the same.A new report by campaigning group peak b based on a survey of over a thousand small businesses found that over a third of small businesses said they are not primarily driven by profit, while 90 per cent felt they have a role to play in supporting community organisations.Over three-quarters support local organisations – including charities, schools and foodbanks – despite the everyday challenges that founders face running their own enterprises.\u0026nbspMany of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the ‘purpose with profit’ label – are already purpose driven entities.Day in, day out, small businesses are embedded in communities and neighbourhoods. They are not just a selling device to earn a livelihood for their owners and employees but an empowering vehicle for those who haven’t been so lucky. And they often do this against a backdrop of a struggling economy with increasing costs, rates, rents and competition from larger scale companies.Jenny Costa found herself appalled that food retailers would throw out fruits and vegetables that didn’t look right rather than present them to their customers so she set up Rubies in the Rubble – a business making sauces and chutney from ingredients otherwise destined for the bin.There are even impact investors now – people who will only use their money to back projects that aim from the outset to help solve a social or environmental problem.One of these investment groups,\u0026nbspMustard Seed, backed Jenny and their fund is seeing huge financial as well as social returns.Proportion of small firms who feel they have a role to play in supporting community organisationsAnd that’s the key pivotal point of change we are witnessing in business. Before we would talk of giving something back or of helping others and frankly it wasn’t good enough.Large firms and their CSR pledges rarely amount to more than spending a day in the year painting the proverbial church wall – old style noblesse oblige made contemporary with the aid of a podcast.I’ve watched many social enterprises set out with great missions yet have terrible financial performance. Their losses are often written off by the massive funds that have emerged in the last decade to back projects aimed at tackling problems that charities or governments have failed to.They are now being superseded by the “purpose with profit” business.What the peak b report teaches us, though, is that many of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the label – are already purpose driven entities.As one of its contributors says, we’re often too British to tell others about the impacts we are making as many feel this is a private matter.But when we also read that people do so despite facing financial troubles of their own, we need to spread the message not just that doing good is good for business, but that telling people we are doing good is good for business.Iqbal Wahhab OBE is the founder of London restaurants The Cinnamon Club and Roast and author of Charity Sucks, published by BitebackShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

However we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.” A Netflix spokesperson: “We’re looking into it but think viewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly.”Guy Wilmot, a partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, said that for easyGroup to succeed, it would have to establish that using the word “easy” in connection with the Netflix show would lead to a likelihood of confusion with the company’s registered trademarks, or that it would take unfair advantage of the firm’s reputation and brands. EasyGroup could also argue that Netflix is passing off its goodwill in the word “easy”. “EasyGroup does have a significant number of registrations in Europe for trademarks which include the word ‘easy’ and they clearly have a significant reputation for certain services, especially air travel services,” said Mr Wilmot. However, he added that this “does not necessarily mean that it will succeed”. “A trademark registration applies to specified goods and services and goodwill attaches to an existing reputation. If easyGroup’s marks are not registered for TV or entertainment-related services then it might struggle to establish infringement or passing off,” he said.“Even if easyGroup has one or more trade mark registrations which cover entertainment, broadcasting or television services (which given the number of marks it has registered is possible) it can still lose the protection of the trademarks. “There is a ‘use it or lose it’ rule under which easyGroup will lose the coverage of the marks in certain services if the trademark has not been used for those services within the last five years (if the mark is more than five years old).”Mr Wilmot added that easyGroup might need to argue that Netflix is taking “unfair advantage” of its trademarks or passing-off, but said both these claims could be difficult to establish given that easyGroup’s goodwill and reputation is in other areas. “In either case, easyGroup would have to show that there is some connection made between consumers of the Netflix show and easyGroup’s brands,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s hard to see growth in manufacturing output recovering until the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been extinguished.”Hit by Brexit uncertaintyThe Office for National Statistics estimated last week that manufacturing, which accounts for around 10 per cent of the UK economy, contracted by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter, following a 0.1 per cent shrinkage in the first three months of the year.This followed a strong performance in 2017, when it is estimated to have grown by 2.6\u0026nbspper cent.A survey of 1,000 export manufacturing firms by the UK Trade Policy Observatory last month found that Brexit had already hit them hard.Almost 30 per cent of those who were able to provide data have already lost business directly as a consequence of the vote to leave the EU and a third have already experienced a Brexit-driven fall in investment.Decline in manufacturing output in second quarter of 2018Separately, the Bank of England reported\u0026nbspon Monday that consumer credit growth slowed to a three-year low in August.Borrowing was up 8.1 per cent year on year, the slowest rate since September 2015.However, mortgage approvals picked up to 66,440, slightly ahead of analysts’\u0026nbspexpectations and above the previous six month average of 64,310.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A third and final series was commissioned in August this year. Sir Stelios, who now runs easyGroup, which includes brands such as easyHotel, easyGym and easyPizza, said: “I think this is a case of typically arrogant behaviour by a very large American tech company who never bothered to check what legal rights other companies have outside the US.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

London building’s history, rooted in the poverty of the Victorian era, is repeating itselfClick to followThe IndependentThe early residents of Toynbee Hall, with Rev Samuel Barnett sitting to the right of his wife HenriettaIt stands where gastropubs now jostle beside the old East End of Petticoat Lane market, where streets are overshadowed by the gleaming towers of the modern City of London.\u0026nbspAmid such bustle, it is easy to overlook the lower rise, altogether more modest Toynbee Hall, and still easier to miss its significance.\u0026nbspYet this is the place that provided formative experiences for two key architects of the welfare state, William Beveridge and Clement Attlee. \u0026nbspThis is the place that can claim a pivotal role in the creation of social justice initiatives such as\u0026nbspthe Child Poverty Action Group.\u0026nbspIt is where the Poor Man’s Lawyer scheme started in 1898, and where free legal advice is still offered today – along with debt counselling, investigation of social problems and many other community services.More than a century after Toynbee Hall opened in 1884, it remains a place of pilgrimage for researchers and innovators the world over, seeking out the institution where so much began, and where so much is still being done.\u0026nbspAnd now, after a £17m restoration and redevelopment, chief executive Jim Minton is determined the reopening of the Grade II listed building should be marked by an exhibition showcasing Toynbee Hall’s history as a “powerhouse for social change”\u0026nbspand suggesting what it could do in the future.“So much did happen here and so much has been inspired by here,” he says.\u0026nbsp“This is a great moment to open the place back up again, to show the community what they have achieved and to say, ‘Let’s achieve even more in the future’.\u0026nbspBecause the problems have not gone away”20th century (Toynbee Hall Archives)There is, of course, a certain irony in that last point.Toynbee Hall was created to help lift the East End out of poverty but continues to confront\u0026nbspthe same issues of low incomes, high debt and poor housing that affected the area in 1884 – with contemporary twists.Since the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote,\u0026nbspsays Minton, “our free legal advice service has started dealing with questions from people from other parts of Europe who have heard something, or been told something by their employer.”While in the 1880s the head of Toynbee Hall described casual labour – the system that saw men massing outside dockyard gates hoping to be picked for a day’s work – as “the hardest problem of east London”, there seems something of a modern echo when\u0026nbspMinton notes: “Over the past 10\u0026nbspyears, we have seen a significant change towards in-work poverty, among people in insecure employment, or on zero-hours contracts.”And yet, when Toynbee Hall opened in the 1880s, it did so during a decade that was supposed to herald a new and better beginning.\u0026nbsp“It was the end of an epoch,” recalled Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp“The great victories had been won.\u0026nbspSlaves were free.\u0026nbspConscience was free.\u0026nbspTrade was free.\u0026nbspBut hunger and squalor were also free and the people demanded something more than liberty.”Minton\u0026nbspsees parallels today with 1818: low income, high debt, and poor housing\u0026nbsp(Toynbee Hall)In 1883, Reverend Andrew Mearns\u0026nbspwould shock middle-class Victorians with\u0026nbspThe Bitter Cry of Outcast London, his pamphlet exposing the horrors within the “rotting and reeking tenement houses” of London’s “great dark region of poverty, misery and immorality”.In 1888,\u0026nbspJack the Ripper would add fresh horror with his Whitechapel murders, virtually\u0026nbspon Toynbee Hall’s doorstep.\u0026nbspAnd in the\u0026nbspparish of St Jude’s – occupied despite the\u0026nbspbishop’s warning that it was “perhaps the worst district in London” – Reverend Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta were\u0026nbspwell-placed to separate grim reality from lurid sensationalism.The reality was plenty bad enough.\u0026nbspIt featured whole families living in a single room, whole neighbourhoods sharing a single lavatory, with sewers running down the middle of streets.\u0026nbspAnd yet the casual labourer was often paying more in rent per cubic foot than the rich of South Kensington.\u0026nbspThe precariousness of his income meant landlords felt justified in charging higher rents to cover themselves against inability to pay or moonlight flits – an early example, perhaps, of what is now known as the “poverty premium”.In 1883 Rev\u0026nbspBarnett was able to return to his old university to speak at the Oxford Union, and to win by unanimous vote the motion that “the condition of the poor in our large towns is a national disgrace”.\u0026nbspAnd he found a receptive audience when, in November 1883, he came “as a prophet”\u0026nbspto talk to a small group of graduates at St John’s College, Oxford, urging them, as one listener recalled, to “share the life of that dim and strange other world of east London”.For the Barnetts, this “university settlement”, proposed eight months after Karl Marx’s death, would help show the people demanding something more than liberty that they did not need to go as far as revolution.“The poor,” Rev Barnett\u0026nbspwrote in 1895, “think progress is to be won by revolution.”\u0026nbsp But\u0026nbsphe believed\u0026nbspprojects such as\u0026nbspToynbee Hall could help preach “the good news of a unity greater than rich or poor … Humanity will help the poor see the rich as their brothers, and God as their father.”Gustave ​Doré’s\u0026nbspimage of the slums of Victorian London may have been sensationalised for a middle-class audience but the reality was\u0026nbspbad enough (Alamy)Rev Barnett and the\u0026nbspforceful, equally accomplished Henrietta\u0026nbsphoped the young Oxford men would do in the city something akin to what the gentry was supposed to do in the countryside: befriending the poor and showing them how to lead better, fuller lives.\u0026nbspThe Barnetts’ vision, however, also contained large doses of humility.Before devising any bright ideas of their own, the Oxford men were supposed to learn from the poor among whom they were going to live.\u0026nbsp“The needs of east London are often urged,” Rev Barnett told them, “but they are little understood.\u0026nbspHe who has, even for a month, shared the life of the poor can never rest again in his old thoughts.”And so began the building, in the heart of the East End, of something resembling an Oxbridge college.\u0026nbspNamed Toynbee Hall, after the Barnetts’ recently deceased kindred spirit Arnold Toynbee, the Oxford historian credited with coining the term “the Industrial Revolution”,\u0026nbspit opened its doors for the first time in 1884.\u0026nbspRev Barnett was the first warden.\u0026nbspThe volunteer residents\u0026nbspdined in a hall adorned with the crests of their old Oxbridge colleges.\u0026nbspThey were soon offering help, solidarity and a rather mind-boggling array of activities to the East End.In one of the most definitive accounts of the early years of Toynbee Hall, Professor Emily Abel described how East End errand boy Ernest Baker found himself assisting in the running of the Toynbee Hall Elizabethan Literary Society.The Natural History Society broadened East Enders’ horizons by taking them into the countryside, and under the tutelage of some of the more vigorous volunteer residents, the Toynbee Travellers’ Club introduced the London poor to the joys of mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps.As Prof Abel noted, Toynbee Hall’s early residents did not always avoid being clumsily patronising –\u0026nbspone suggested the Shakespeare Club could counteract east Londoners’ “inability to amuse themselves rationally”.Created with

is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalAmong those present was a shabbily dressed character who said his name was Richter.\u0026nbspIn broken English, he berated Morley for supporting the imperialist foreign policy of Britain and other “capitalist nations”.“Go down to Limehouse or Shadwell and see how the people live,” said Richter.\u0026nbsp“Their slums, impoverishment, degradation and prostitution!\u0026nbsp That’s where your foreign policy should lie.\u0026nbspThey are the victims of your capitalist organisation which is just as powerful and cruel as the force of arms.”Morley and others politely begged to differ –\u0026nbspso politely that Richter was invited back to Toynbee Hall for tea a few days later.William Bowman, a Toynbee Hall resident who was present at the tea, recalled how Richter, “who seemed hungry”, tucked into the cakes and was particularly fascinated by the buttered muffins, which he had never tried before.But he wouldn’t budge from his belief in violent revolution.“History has shown,” he told the Toynbee Hall residents between mouthfuls of cake and muffins, “that no great change has been brought about without the shedding of blood and revolution.”Eventually he declared: “I have enjoyed this talk, but now my time is up.\u0026nbspI must go to visit my friends in Limehouse.”Richter\u0026nbspshook hands with the assembled company and departed.\u0026nbspOnly much later did the Toynbee Hall residents realise that they had in fact been having tea with the exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.In a gentler way, some of the stances taken by Toynbee Hall and its residents have been, if not revolutionary, then at least profoundly challenging to conventional wisdom.\u0026nbspEven as the hall opened, the Barnetts were\u0026nbspin the process of parting ways with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), which had started in 1869 as the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity.Much emphasis was placed on repressing mendicity\u0026nbsp– begging.\u0026nbspRather as some now rail against a perceived “benefits culture”, the social reformer Octavia Hill, a driving force in the COS, firmly believed that indiscriminate alms-giving “degraded” the poor, making them happy to rely on charity and unable or unwilling to support themselves through hard work.In a possible echo of the current debates around fit-to-work benefits tests, it was believed that extensive scrutiny of applications for “relief” was needed to distinguish the virtuous but luckless worker from the “clever pauper”.“The main tone of action,” maintained Hill, “must be severe.\u0026nbspThere is much of rebuke and repression needed, although a deep and silent undercurrent of pity may flow beneath.”In the eyes of the Fabian Beatrice Webb, the Barnetts “discovered that there was a deeper evil than unrestrained charity, namely unrestricted and unregulated capitalism and landlordism.”And so in 1888 the matchgirls of the East End found allies in Toynbee Hall when they went on strike, protesting against pitiful wages and factory conditions that included white phosphorous fumes destroying jawbones, giving\u0026nbspmatch-makers “phossy-jaw”.In an early example of Toynbee Hall residents learning from their East End neighbours, a group of them made their own investigations, then helped shape public opinion with letters to The Times detailing the matchgirls’ “deplorable conditions” and below-subsistence wages.\u0026nbspAfter its first warden Samuel Barnett died in 1913, it could be said that Toynbee Hall rose to other challenges.\u0026nbspOn Sunday 4 October\u0026nbsp1936 Oswald Mosley tried to march his uniformed blackshirts through the East End.\u0026nbspJewish groups, trade unionists and leftwingers mobilised to block the fascists’ path with barricades and cries of “They shall not pass!”When the police tried to clear a route for the British Union of Fascists, the “Battle of Cable Street” began.\u0026nbspThe fascists did not pass.\u0026nbspDefeated by the dogged East Enders, police commissioner Sir Philip Game was forced to tell Mosley to march west, out of the area.A week later, however, in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom, about 200 fascists smashed up Jewish shops and houses in the Mile End Road, even throwing a young child and elderly Jewish man through a window.Toynbee Hall warden Jimmy Mallon was appalled.\u0026nbspHe called a meeting at Toynbee Hall that led to the creation of a Council of Citizens of East London, which then issued a notice to be displayed in shops and workplaces.\u0026nbsp“Citizens of East London,” the notice warned.\u0026nbsp “Forces are at work to destroy the common sense and toleration and good humour on which we pride ourselves.\u0026nbspWe must work against these forces.\u0026nbspBoycott provocative demonstrations.\u0026nbspMaintain calm and good temper.\u0026nbspStand together for fair play.”Meanwhile, Jimmy Mallon joined a delegation that persuaded the government of the need for what became the Public Order Act 1936.It banned the wearing of uniforms for political purposes, as well as enhancing police powers to deal with marches.Profumo found redemption at Toynbee Hall, rising from dishwasher to chairman (Toynbee Hall Archives)Such achievements are, perhaps, one answer to the sour aside of East Ender and future Labour leader George Lansbury, who in 1928 wrote that Toynbee Hall was used as a stepping stone by ambitious young careerists who would eventually claim that: “The interests of the poor were best served by leaving east London to stew in its own juice while they became members of parliament, cabinet ministers, civil servants.”Had he lived long enough, Lansbury might have added that Toynbee Hall was also used by at least one ex-cabinet minister to forge a new, post-scandal career.It is often recalled that in 1963, after being caught lying to parliament about his affair with Christine Keeler, John Profumo began a new career washing dishes at Toynbee Hall, rising to become chairman in 1982 and “learning humility” in the process.\u0026nbspBut it is often forgotten how much Profumo achieved at Toynbee Hall.\u0026nbspHe raised funds, helped ease overcrowding through involvement in the Toynbee Housing Association, and backed potentially controversial schemes like the “Grendon outpost”, providing aftercare for former psychiatric-prison inmates.In what could have been another riposte to George Lansbury, William Beveridge freely acknowledged that his coming to Toynbee Hall, aged 24, in 1903 had been the stepping stone to other things.\u0026nbspBut in the same breath, he said that none of his later achievements would have been possible without the “special knowledge … gained in Whitechapel”.During his two years at Toynbee Hall, Beveridge was able, he later recalled, “to learn about the main economic problem of those days, not from books, but by interviewing unemployed applicants for relief”.And Beveridge’s recommendations were implemented by the post-war government of fellow Toynbee alumnus Clement Attlee, who spent a year as the hall’s secretary in 1910.\u0026nbspAttlee came to Toynbee Hall with prior experience of the East End, having been the manager of Stepney Boys’ Club and an assistant to Beatrice Webb.In his 1920 book Social Worker, the Oxford-educated former public schoolboy revealed some of the lessons the East End had taught him.I met a small boy in the street one day.Attlee (first left) at Toynbee Hall in 1910 (Courtesy of Anne, Countess Attlee)Echoing the Barnetts’\u0026nbspgrowing distaste for the COS, while seemingly anticipating some of the thinking behind – and modern arguments about – the welfare state, Attlee inveighed against\u0026nbsp“the suggestion that those in need of relief should be passed through a sort of sieve”“They will spend much time finding ways in which small wages may be made to go a long way, without considering whether those wages should not be raised, or recognising that the claim to a share in the better things of life which is expressed in the purchase of luxuries is a more hopeful thing than submission to low wages.”In the newly restored Toynbee Hall, Jim Minton expresses pride in the connection to men like Attlee and Beveridge. But he is careful to temper such pride with a recognition of the work still to be done.\u0026nbspDespite 134 years of “progress”, despite the wealth represented by those gleaming City of London towers, the East End – still – contains two of the three worst-rated UK parliamentary constituencies for child poverty.\u0026nbspAnd in 2015, the last time such official statistics were compiled, the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham were ranked the worst local authority areas in the country for income-deprivation among older people.Child food poverty ‘sparks return of Victorian scourges’Nearly half of all children in London and Birmingham ‘live in poverty’Government must tackle ‘slum’ conditions faced by private rentersMy forefather’s life in Manchester’s slumsTower Hamlets, Toynbee Hall’s local borough, has about 2,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation and in 2015 just over a quarter of its population was found to be living in income deprivation.“We are talking every day to people who have financial problems,” says\u0026nbspMinton.\u0026nbsp“There are still huge amounts of poverty in east London.“The learning process that Attlee and Beveridge and hundreds of other less famous people would have gone through at Toynbee Hall,” says Minton, “would have been about challenging, and saying: ‘This is unacceptable.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening, and what can we do about it?’”“That,” he declares, “is very much the spirit we want to keep alive.”\u0026nbsp‘Toynbee Hall: A Powerhouse for Social Change’ is open Monday-Friday and on the third weekend of every month at Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London, E1 6LSBattle of Cable StreetShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal.

public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

Wrong.What is unthinkable is that this Government, or any British government, could be bullied, by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country\u0027s interests.His speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on Monday comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwould be a national disaster.Brexit news: Dominic Raab will send a warning shot to the EU (Image: PAEPA )But Mr Raab said any deal which locks in Britain to the EU by membership of a customs union or the European Economic Area.He also insisted that there are limits to the UK\u0027s readiness to take the EU\u0027s concerns on board.Mr Raab said: Our willingness to compromise is not without limits.We are leaving the European Union in fact, not just in name. If we can\u0027t obtain a deal that secures that objective, if an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and Customs Union or if the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our union, then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.Restating his backing for Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan, Mr Raab sent a message to Tory Brexiteers who want to ditch her plan.\u0026nbspHe said: If I\u0027d told you three years ago that we were going to end free movement, stop the vast annual budget contributions, leave the Single Market, get out of the Customs Union, pursue an independent trade policy, make parliament supreme, protect the Union, exit the Common Fisheries Policy and ditch the Common Agricultural Policy you\u0027d have bitten my arm off.My approach to Brexit is pragmatic, not dogmatic. Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.A deal that delivers on the referendum, because that\u0027s our democratic duty.A deal that manages the risks of Brexit, because that\u0027s our responsibility.A deal that grasps the opportunities of Brexit, because we\u0027re at our best when we\u0027re optimistic about the future.And a deal that protects our precious Union, because we are the Conservative and Unionist Party.The Brexit Secretary also rejected the European Commission\u0027s proposal for a backstop solution to the Irish border issue under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU customs area.Follow Express below for live updates from the Tory conference...

Of course it is.And, let me be clear, it is going to happen because that is what the country voted for.But when the Brexit debate is over - and difficult as it is to imagine today, I promise you that one day it will be - our work, as Conservatives, will not be.He added:\u0026nbspI am an enthusiast for the change that is coming.And for the benefits it will bring to our society. And I am committed to preparing Britain for it.12:20pm update: Hammond has sent a warning to the EU\u0027s Donald TuskDuring his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference, the Chancellor said: I share the Prime Minister\u0027s determination to get the Chequers plan agreed.Mr Tusk says it won\u0027t work, but that\u0027s what people said about the light bulb in 1878.Our job is to prove him wrong.12:18pm update: The Chancellor said he will ensure he protects the UK economy after Brexit\u0026nbspHe said: So over the next few weeks we must stand together four-square behind the prime minister to get the best possible outcome for Britain while at the same time taking the precaution of preparing for the possibility of \u0027no-deal\u0027.And be in no doubt that I will maintain enough fiscal firepower to support our economy if that happens.But I\u0026rsquom going to stick my neck out here today and make a prediction to you that when the prime minister gets a deal agreed there will be a boost to our economic growth.A \u0027Deal Dividend\u0027 which we will share, in line with our balanced approach between keeping taxes low supporting public services reducing the deficit and investing in Britain\u0026rsquos future.12:15pm update: Hammond has thrown his support behind May\u0027s Chequers plan\u0026nbspHe said he shared Mrs May\u0027s determination to go ahead with the plans, before adding Brexit will happen because it\u0027s what the people voted for.\u0026nbspHammond added: Europe remains, by far, our biggest market. And after 45 years of membership, Britain\u0026rsquos economy has shaped itself around that fact. Complex supply chains cross and re-cross our borders.Over 11,000 trucks each day pass through the Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel alone carrying tens of thousands of tonnes of food, components and finished products in both directions with no more delay or bureaucracy than they would crossing the border from England into Wales.And our businesses, and the workers whose jobs depend on them need that friction-free access to continue.That is why I share the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos determination to get the Chequers Plan agreed.A plan which delivers on the decision of the British people avoids a hard border in Ireland preserves our precious Union and safeguards British jobs and British businesses.12:08pm update: Chancellor Hammond says Brexit will \u0027shape the future of our economy for many years to come\u0027\u0026nbspHe said: Whatever the outcome, Europe will remain firmly anchored just a few miles off the coast of Kent.Mr Hammond joked: So, they\u0027re not going anywhere I\u0027m told, before adding: So we will be neighbours and we are going to have to carry on living with each other.\u0026nbspBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab warned the EU that Britain is prepared to walk away without a deal (Image: REUTERS )11.10am update: Raab calls for party unity on BrexitMr Raab ended his speech by urging members of his party to come together.He added: We\u0026rsquove had our arguments. But now is the time to put them behind us.Now is the time to come together. Because this is a moment for the optimists.And ours is a country ready to shine.10:51am update: Raab mocked Remainers for \u0027bankrolling a campaign\u0027 to \u0027scare the wits\u0027 out of British people\u0026nbspHe said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a real sense that Leave won fair and square and most people just want to get on with it.

Debris will fall from the sky.He told the audience: \u0026ldquoHonestly, it would be pathetic if it wasn\u0026rsquot so dangerous.10:46am update: Raab attacked the campaign for a second referendum - the People\u0027s Vote CampaignHe said: I have been heartened by the fact that the majority of those who voted to Remain have accepted the referendum verdict.For them, the integrity of our democracy is far more important than winning or losing on any one issue.But I\u0026rsquoll tell you what\u0026rsquos not democracy. The efforts of a small, but influential group of senior politicians and establishment figures to overturn the result of the referendum.They want to stop us leaving. You can just picture them, sitting in an expensive advertising agency, discussing how to claim that black is white.\u0026ldquoOur research shows that the public doesn\u0026rsquot like the idea of a second referendum.\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos all right \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquoll rebrand it a People\u0026rsquos Vote. They might buy that.10:38am update: The Brexit secretary admitted Brexit is not \u0027perfect\u0027 but says he won\u0027t be bullied by BrusselsHe said his approach to Brexit was  pragmatic, not dogmatic.Mr Raab added: Do I think the deal we are pursuing is perfect? Of course not.Is it everything I wanted? No it isn\u0026rsquot. This is a negotiation. There have been compromises.We\u0027re not decoupling as quickly or as completely as some would like.And we have been prepared to accept certain EU requirements, in order to secure our own interests.He attacked Brussels bullies saying: Our Prime Minister has been constructive and respectful. In return we heard jibes from senior leaders.He added: Some people say that no deal is unthinkable. Wrong. What is unthinkable is that this Government, or any British government, could be bullied, by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country\u0027s interests.10:31am update: Dominic Raab is delivering his speech where he\u0026nbspurged voters and members of his own party to respect the referendum resultHe appealed for tolerance, saying: I want to start with an appeal for tolerance. We all know that Brexit is a controversial subject.It excites strong passions.\u0026nbspBut as a party and as a country, we also need to keep a sense of proportion.Everybody had a vote and most people have an opinion. But only a small minority think it\u0027s worth fighting over, except when they\u0027re on Twitter.It\u0027s important to remember that the person sitting next to you on the bus into town, at your desk at work, round the breakfast table and, yes, here in this hall today.May have voted the other way to you in the referendum.\u0026nbspThat\u0026rsquos the genius of our democracy.We express our differences at the ballot box, but afterwards we come together, and respect the result.\u0026nbspWhen it comes to wanting what\u0027s best for Britain, we\u0027re all on the same side.Brexit news: Dominic Raab said the EU \u0027need to get serious now \u0027 (Image: PA )9:54am update:\u0026nbspBelgium\u0026rsquos firebrand immigration minister Theo Francken has placed an extraordinary level of blame on \u0026ldquobeautiful Britain for Europe\u0026rsquos immigration woesShe told Express the British do not hide behind Brexit during European Union-wide discussions on how to tackle the contentious issue of migration9:20am update: Remainer Philip Hammond has said Brexit is a \u0027good idea\u0027Asked if he thinks Brexit is a good idea, Mr Hammond told Good Morning Britain: Yes. The British people have determined that we are leaving the EU.Our challenge as the Government is to do that in a way that minimises friction for the British economy, so we get a smooth Brexit, so that we can carry on trading with the EU.The Chancellor, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 referendum, said: This is a democracy. We listen to the will of the people and when the people have expressed their will and made their decision, we get on with it.My argument now is not about whether we should leave the EU or not, it\u0027s about making sure that we do it in a way that protects Britain\u0027s businesses, jobs and prosperity.9:08am update: Jeremy Hunt launched an extraordinary attack on the EU\u0026nbspThe Home Secretary sensationally compared the EU to the Soviet Union as he attacked Brussels\u0027 hardline stance over Brexit.8:49am update: Chancellor Philip Hammond and Piers Morgan have clashed in an extraordinary Brexit showdown\u0026nbspThe Good Morning Britain host was\u0026nbspkeen to find out if Mr Hammond\u0027s view on Brexit had remained the same or if he had changed his point of view.He asked: \u0026ldquoDo you personally believe that this is a very good idea for the public?

I\u0026rsquom a Democrat, so I believe that the British people have decided.But Mr Morgan was not satisfied with his answer and interjected with a line of interrogating of questions, saying: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not my question. Do you personally, as the Chancellor, believe that this is a good thing for the country?\u0026nbsp8:43am update:\u0026nbspFormer international development secretary Priti Patel has thrown herself behind Mrs May\u0026nbspThe Witham MP backed Theresa May to finish Brexit negotiations - although she demanded a shift away from Chequers towards a Canada-style deal - appearing to snub Boris Johnson\u0027s expected leadership challenge.Speaking of a leadership challenge, she said: No, I don\u0027t subscribe to that.I\u0027ve never been an advocate of saying \u0027put someone else in\u0027 - I don\u0027t believe in any of that.8:37am update:\u0026nbspBritons have expressed fury at Mrs May\u0027s refusal to drop her Chequers plan\u0026nbspA number of Brits have warned they will reconsider voting for the Conservative Party if the Government does not offer Britain with a full exit from the European Union.One Hornchurch resident told the BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme: \u0026ldquoWe was the founders of law and order many many centuries ago and why should we be told by Europeans how to govern?

But what do we know about what happened on that fateful night?.On the night of November 21, 1974, two explosions ripped through two separate pubs in Birmingham, killing 21 and injuring 182 others.A number of explosive devices had been placed around Birmingham, with one left at Mulberry Bush and a second at Tavern in the Town, both public houses on New Street, and a third outside a bank about two miles away.Warning calls were then made to a number of newspapers, with the Birmingham Post receiving a call at 8.11pm warning a bomb had been planted at the Rotunda, the site of Mulberry Bush.A similar call was made to the Birmingham Evening Mail newspaper.The first device exploded at Mulberry Bush at 8.17pm, just six minutes after the warning call was phoned in.The explosion ripped through the pub, blowing a crater measuring 40 inches into the concrete floor.Ten people were killed instantly.Victims were left trapped under the partially-collapsed roof with those passing by in the street also injured by glass from shattered windows.It is believed the bomb had been hidden inside a duffel bag or briefcase left near the rear entrance of the pub.But as authorities desperately worked to help those left seriously injured and evacuate the area, a second explosion ripped through Tavern in the Town.Nine people were injured, with another two later dying from their injuries.A third, undetonated device was found outside Barclays Bank at 9.15pm.The Provisional Irish Republican Army  has always denied responsibility for the attacks but have widely been blamed for the explosions.In the calls made to warn authorities of the planted explosives, the code double x was mentioned - a phrase used by the IRA to alert authorities to the legitimacy of the threat.While the IRA usually gave authorities about half an hour to respond to threats, it is believed that the phone box planned to be used to call in the threat had been vandalised - meaning the bomber had to travel to a phone box further away and therefore taking longer to alert authorities.The Hunt For The Birmingham Bombers is airing TONIGHT  on ITV at 10.45pm.The real suspects have remained hidden for decades - but the programme will reveal what it claims are the prime suspects.The ITV investigation names former British soldier James Francis Gavin and another man as the prime suspects for planting the bombs.The other suspect has never before been publicly named.Gavin has been named previously in connection with the bombings but not as a bomb-planter.The men, who always proclaimed their innocence and were later released after an appeal, became known as the Birmingham Six.Six men were arrested over the bombings, Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker.The six men were arrested soon after the explosions, with the men claiming to have undergone severe physical and psychological torture to extract confessions from them.After a trial of 45 days in 1975, all six of the men were found guilty of 21 counts of murder.The men had been tried alongside Michael Murray and Michael Sheehan, who were convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions and sentenced to nine years jail.Co-accused James Kelly was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause explosions, but guilty of the possession of explosives and sentenced to one years imprisonment.The Birmingham Six maintained their innocence throughout their trial and after their imprisonment, but had their appeals in 1976 dismissed.A number of appeals and documentaries relating to the groups case were aired over the following years, raising questions over police methods to have the men confess.But it wasnt until 1991 that the group were found not guilty of the charges with  Lord Justice Lloyd saying: In the light of the fresh evidence which has been made available since the last hearing in this court, your appeals will be allowed and you are free to go.They were released from jail on March 14, 1991.The families of the victims have been pushing for answers in the 40 years after the fatal bombing.An original inquest began the day after the attacks and was halted when six men were found guilty.But families have since spoken out and campaigned for answers with Julie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine died in the blasts, saying: “All we want is the truth.”  The case, known as one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in the UK, is now facing a fresh inquest.Serious questions have now been raised over the fatal bombings, with a fresh inquest now to be heard.The new inquest was ordered into the bombings after signicant new evidence about the blasts in crowded pubs on November 21, 1974, came to light.It has been welcomed by the families of the victims after the initial inquest was suspended in 1975 after being overtaken by the criminal inquiry.Senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt announced the decision after holding several review hearings and receiving “signicant” new information about the double bombing on November 21, 1974.She said that there were questions to be answered as to what warnings police had been given before the attack.She said: I have serious concerns that advanced notice of the bombs may have been available to the police and that they failed to take the necessary steps to protect le.This is specically in respect of the two matters I have identied.It is only in respect of that issue that I consider there is sufficient reason to resume an inquest to investigate the circumstances of these deaths.So I am satisfied that the inquest should be resumed.Julie Hambleton, who has been one of the campaigners to find answers into her sister Maxine and other victims death, welcomed the decision, saying it was way beyond our expectations.She added: All we want is to be heard - truth, justice and accountability.We hope the police and Police Federation dont decide to appeal on this... that would be highly cynical on their part.Today, we stand united.

It’s crashed and burned.WE hope the poll revealing voters in ­marginal seats deserting the Tories over sky-high rents is enough to stir the ­Government from its paralysis.The Tories are consumed by Brexit.But away from that they must wake up and present radical ideas to beat ­Corbyn’s, especially on housing.They have an advantage.Theirs are more likely to be sane.And vanishingly less likely to put hundreds of thousands on the dole.But Theresa May must realise that voters have more pressing problems than Brexit which could cost her power.Next week the Tories must have a new story to tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past 12 months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past 20 years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number 10 for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet?”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But even  they get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for 2022. The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in 1951 or even the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend 45 minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask me  certain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them?Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids 22 years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing 60 women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as 17.He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,  you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one cares  you have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £75 to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU was set up to protect freedom.“It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.Mr Hunt also issued a plea for warring Tory factions to come together and end their Brexit civil war.He added: “We can only unite the country  we are united ourselves. In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PM  she did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for 10 years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £500m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain \u0026amp Northern Ireland in 2022.FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it attacked all the victims for failing to show their implants really were filled with the risky PIP silicone.UK claimants have been sent “intimidating” writs warning them that TUV is appealing against last year’s court order that forced it to pay out cash to help them have their implants removed.Leanne Green, 29, whose left breast burst after she went from an A cup to a DD, said: “The very idea that I would lie about having breast implants just to make some cash is sick.“So many of the women involved had the implants after cancer.To accuse them of lying is about as low as you can get.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the 17.4million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-Ho  Brexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,  utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It is the least you deserve.”Ford admitted burglary, assault and driving dangerously, while disqualied and without a licence, while his accomplice is believed to be at large.In an impact statement Mr Oldham told how he and his we had lived in their home for 19 years and the burglary had influenced their decision to move.He said he is not a violent person but had been forced to defend himself, and added that his we now feels insecure so they had had to make additional security measures to their home.Mr Oldham said: “It has changed my we and I and we realise how vulnerable we are.”Desmond Lennon, defending, said that Ford had been living an itinerant lestyle after his release from prison and “had gone off the rails.”At the time of the offences his grandmother, to whom he was close, was dying."},{"url":null,"title":"schools face headlice epidemic","story":"A measure designed to save the NHS £100 million a year sees GPs being banned from prescribing “Bug Buster” kits - which cost the health service £4.92 each.The itchy bugs are likely to go round schools like wildfire, Community Hygiene Concern said, because poorer families won’t be able to pay the £13 needed for over-the-counter insecticides.A 2016 US study found 98% of headlice had developed resistance to non-prescribed remedies, while a study of 200 British children found almost 50% had caught lice in the past five years.Frances Fry, a spokeswoman for Community Hygiene Concern told the Observer: “Not everyone can afford to repeatedly buy head-lice treatments, which are very, very expensive and can be ineffective.”She added: “Children whose parents cannot afford the treatments will be victimised and bullied, and all the judgements and stigmas will .”An NHS England spokesman said: “This will free up to £100m to reinvest in better mental health, cancer and A\u0026ampE services.“Clinical experts advise head lice can be safely and effectively treated by wet combing, with chemical treatment only recommended in exceptional circumstances.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why couldnt they have sorted this sooner?Another added: My daughter is unhappy in herself due to not being able to mix with her friends in the yard at play time. Why are children in Llanfairfechan being treated like second class citizens?Now school governors and council officials are arguing over who should foot the repair bill.Conwy Council initially said the school had reserved funding it can use, before later pledging to pay whatever is left over.But school governors say its the councils responsibility as the bill would leave them struggling to pay staff.Sun Online has contacted the council to explain how the work should be funded.A letter that was sent home to parents about the playground yesterday states: The surface has steadily deteriorated over the past four years and related accidents increased to such an extent that the board governors and the headmaster made a joint decision, over the summer break, to close it until it can be resurfaced.The decision was not taken lightly but our duty of care to both pupils and staff has been our primary concern.The area will be resurfaced during October half term and the yard will be re-opened on  to school on November 5.The cost of the resurfacing is going to be substantial and we are currently in protracted negotiations with Conwy Council regarding how we are going to fund this work.We will also need to fund raise ourselves in order to pay for some of the work that needs to be done.A Conwy Council spokeswoman told the newspaper: In common with other local authorities in Wales, Conwy Council is suffering severe cuts in funding, which means it can’t do all that it would wish to do.Some schools, however, maintain high levels of reserves - at the end of the 2017/18 financial year Ysgol Pant y Rhedyn had reserves in excess of £70,000.This meant the school had not spent 13 per cent of its allocation. This is money that could and should be spent on the education of pupils and their learning environment. She added: We understand the school has now made arrangements for the yard to be resurfaced during October half term. Conwy Education Services are contributing towards the cost.But Cathy Heavers, vice chair of governors at Ysgol Pant y Rheydyn told Sun Online there will be a huge impact on pupils and staff  they are forced to pay.She said: As Conwy County Borough Council has stated, there was indeed £73K in the reserves prior to July. But as of September 2018 our balance at is down to circa £45K, which is 7% of the budget reserves.Even at a standstill budget , the school is likely to have only £8K in reserve by the end of the year. Our financial position is probably better than many other schools in Conwy, due to the prudent financial management of the team at the school. Yet despite this, we’re still in a position where we’re unable to make ends meet. As things stand, this is unlikely to be enough to fund the current staffing structure - without even looking at the cost of resurfacing the school yard. Resurfacing the yard to make it safe for pupils will cost the school at least £14K, taking into account the contribution the Local Education Authority has agreed to make.It doesn’t take a mathematician to work out the impact this will have on pupils and staff. Parents have every right to be angry that the school are having to pay for this, when CCBC is responsible for maintaining the yard."},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton mum carole selling zombie princess diana halloween costume","story":"Zombie Sleeping Princess Costume is for girls as young as four and features an exposed rib cage and organs.But friends of Princess Diana have described the outfit as sick, linking the fancy dress costume to the princess who was killed in a car crash in 1997.Simone Simmons, a friend of Dianas, told The Daily Star: This is sicker than sick.This is really scraping the barrel.Its twisted and warped.Ms Simmons also hoped that people would boycott the website.The gory outfit is on sale for £10.99 on the website owned by the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge.Describing the costume, Party Pieces writes: Our Zombie Sleeping Princess costume in pink includes a dress with chest print detail.This not so pretty princess costume features a blood-drenched pink silky dress with a jagged skirt.The top includes a gruesome print of the poor zombie princesses rib cage and organs.This princess will be the scariest princess at any Halloween party.Majesty magazine Editor-in-Chief and royal writer Ingrid Seward is also said to have deemed the outfit to be in very poor taste.Earlier this year, Tesco also caused uproar by selling a fox hunter costume for children as young as seven.And Amazon went even further, stocking a Halloween costume of Anne Frank who was murdered in a concentration camp after years of hiding from the Nazis. Caroles daughter Kate Middleton, 36, became a princess herself when she married Prince William at Westminster Abbey in 2011.Other costumes on the Party Pieces site include a zombie cheerleader costume and an undead red riding hood.Party Pieces has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435781007.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg blasted for calling african country the peoples republic of jam jar","story":"The top Brexiteer was accused of “casual racism” over the joke at a Tory conference fringe event.Mr Rees-Mogg made the quip during a pro-Brexit rally in Birmingham last night.He said: All the countries who are least interested in their people call themselves ‘peoples’, don’t they?“So the People’s Republic of China?

And after 45 years of membership, Britain’s economy has shaped itself around that fact.Mr Hammond predicted a deal idend which will see the UKs economy boom once we strike a trade deal with the EU.And he laid out a series of policies to boost the economy including:Labour hit back at his attack on them - Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: The Chancellor’s speech confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory party, increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day le most people experience.“The Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000162061137.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"food waste supermarkets meals for the poor michael gove conservative conference","story":"The Environment Secretary will today launch a £1billion plan to use food set for the skip to provide 250 million meals for the needy.Those who could get access to the extra food include kids in breakfast clubs, elderly people in old peoples homes, disabled groups and the homeless.Mr Gove said today ahead of the announcement: Nobody wants to see good food go to waste.

In a huge hostage to fortune, the Chancellor claimed the economy will boom as soon as the Prime Minister brings back an as-yet-unknown package from Brussels - which MPs could still vote down. The new plea was aimed squarely at Tory Brexiteers who are threatening to vote down the deal Mrs May hopes to bring back in just a few weeks\u0027 time. It is the pro-Remain Chancellor\u0027s version of the much-disputed claim that Brexit itself will bring a \u0027idend\u0027 for the NHS - after 2020, when payments to Brussels are cut. Mr Hammond has been known as one of the most gloomy ministers on Brexit. Only this morning he admitted firms were sitting on their hands due to deadlock in talks with Brussels. Yet addressing Conservative members in Birmingham today, he claimed: I\u0027m going to stick my neck out here today and make a prediction to you - that when the Prime Minister gets a deal agreed there will be a boost to our economic growth.  A \u0027deal idend\u0027, which we will share in line with our balanced approach between keeping taxes low, supporting public services, reducing the deficit, and investing in Britain\u0027s future. But Mr Hammond also said preparations for no deal are continuing. I will maintain enough fiscal firepower in my locker to support our economy  that happens, he said. In a wide-ranging speech that quoted Margaret Thatcher and free market economist Adam Smith, Mr Hammond vowed not to outbid Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Labour party and said Tories must reclaim 21st century capitalism. Ripping off Labour\u0027s \u0027for the many not the few\u0027 slogan, he declared Tories must reassure the very many who will worry about what new technologies mean for their job security - worry that the gains will be made by the few.  And he said Conservatives are faced with an “urgent mission” to persuade voters to avoid “dangerous and seductive populism led by Jeremy Corbyn - who is totally unfit to govern this country. The Chancellor declared: We will not outbid Corbyn with short-term gimmicks that cause long-term damage. We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing. We will not promise the illusory utopia he offers. Because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears. He added: Corbyn boasts that Labour are a government in waiting. Well, I say let’s keep him waiting - this year, next year and every year. Elsewhere Mr Hammond announced a \u0026pound125 million package to change the distribution of the Tories\u0027 \u0027apprenticeship levy\u0027 after concerns over how well the system was working. Measures include allowing large employers to transfer up to 25% of their apprenticeship levy funds to businesses in their supply chain from April next year.  He also announced \u0026pound100million for a \u0027National Retraining Scheme\u0027 in partnership with the CBI and the TUC.  The Chancellor also warned robots will be the biggest threat on the horizon - and a huge opportunity. In the next decade or so, Articial Intelligence, self-driving cars, personalized medicine, virtual reality, advanced robotics and many, many other cutting-edge developments will all begin to transform our lives, he said. A future where cars don’t pollute, and we’ve all but eliminated traffic accidents Where you are able to order and 3D print a product at home, instead of waiting for it to be delivered Where cancer is tamed, so that fewer of us have to go through the heartache of losing a loved one to this cruel disease. All of this is science fact not fiction. Despite his reputation - and telling a string of jokes that no one laughed at - the Chancellor insisted: I am an optimist.

I have to confess it’s not a place I’ve been to before. But  we’re to change the lives of any of the people I write about, you are the people I need to convince that things desperately need changing in our country. And I’d like to thank you for trying to listen to voices outside of your own political mainstream. All of our politics on every side suffer from the silos we are trapped in and can’t climb out of. So, thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be in Birmingham, and particularly relevant to what I’m going to say today as it’s the city we started our Wigan Pier Project from. For the past two years we’ve been retracing George Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier and he set out from here in the Midlands.  When we began our journey in January 2017, I’d read about the growing cardboard city in Birmingham, and I came to interview homeless people at a breakfast service. It was a bitterly cold morning when I got off the train from London, so cold that my feet froze on the walk from the station, and when I got to the breakfast place there was a queue twice round the block. All the homeless people were talking about a young man who had died overnight in sub-zero temperatures. When I found the place he’d died, a little carpark on John Bright Street, less than 15 minutes’ walk from here, someone had already taken the warm and dry patch he’d died on – dragging their filthy duvet over a broken-down cardboard box. The people we went on to interview over the next few days and weeks, could literally break your heart. A veteran in a wheelchair who had been RPGd. A man who told us about all the homeless people he knew who had thrown themselves off buildings. An amazing homeless band called the Dissenters. Who knew that ‘Broken Britain’ wasn’t a slogan but an ambition? No-one in this room can deny that homelessness in this country has grown exponentially in this country since 2010 when the Conservative Party came to power and David Cameron announced the ‘Age of Austerity’. Just walk round here tonight for a few minutes and you’ll see homeless people all over the city, just as you’ll see them in London and Manchester and Liverpool and Blackpool and Hastings and yes, even in Windsor, where a Tory council wanted them removed for spoiling the Royal Wedding. So, no it’s not just Birmingham, but there’s still something amazing about how the Conservative Party always comes and holds its party conference here. Something geographically appealing about its centrality I imagine. And yet. Look at the Midlands: Birmingham City Council’s budget has been slashed by an eyewatering 40 per cent. By 2025 the Council budget will have lost three-quarters of a billion pounds. Look at the crisis at Birmingham Prison this summer. The collapse at Northamptonshire County Council. Recent figures showing that childcare costs have risen nine times faster than wages in the West Midlands since 2008. The fact that yesterday a group of Birmingham home care workers, mostly low paid women, lead a march through the city. I know it’s must be easy to dismiss these people as Marxist agitators – but what  they are just homecare workers whose services have been devastated by privatisation? Who work under minimum wage because they won’t leave old people in wet pads, but who work for skeleton companies owned by hedge funds? When George Orwell set off from Birmingham in 1936, it was because he understood there were two Britains. A well-off Britain that was more than comfortable. And a Britain barely surviving in the industrial north and Midlands. What he came to see, as he travelled through the north, I believe, was something even more serious – that the sweat of one Britain was enabling the comfort of the other Britain. That’s never been more true in our Britain today – where one person’s ability to order a perfectly chilled bottle of wine instantly and cheaply from Amazon Prime, relies on the sweat of another person toiling in a windowless workhouse. Are these people left behind? Those people working in reinvented Victorian insecurity? Those people for whom the inflated housing market inflated that bit too far? For whom the welfare safety net has been slashed beyond recognition? The people working three jobs who are still sometimes skipping meals so their children can eat? Like Orwell, I think we need to question language at every turn. Austerity did this, of course it did – but it was enabled by language, by words serving a political narrative. It’s language – the language of strivers and scroungers, the language of racist ide and rule, separating the working classes so they are isible by the colour of their skin, that has led to this mess in the first place. The repulsive language of Leave and the patronising, hectoring language of Remain. So, I have to start by asking what you mean by ‘Left Behind Britain’? Do you mean some people weren’t All In It Together after all? Left behind sounds like someone that missed the bus. Maybe they were a bit too slow to get on board. Maybe they weren’t modern people, stuck in their ways. The angry, jittery, poverty-stricken, Brexit-y parts of Britain aren’t ‘left behind’. They have been Held Back from getting on the bus in the first place. As a direct result of policies that have been developed at Tory conferences like this one. By the attack on their support through welfare reform. By the cuts to their schools and the services for kids that need extra help. By the closure of the Sure Start centres that used to help level the early years playing fields. By the closure of the libraries where they used to search for jobs, and borrow books and do their homework. By the lack of hope inherent in walking down boarded up high streets every day. You can call them Just About Managing. I call them in crisis, in debt, and incandescent. Anyway – two years ago, an unnecessary vote called by a Conservative Prime Minister who was trying to outwit a flank of his party, offered Held Back people a lightning rod moment.  It still might not have been defining, but the Tory-led Remain campaign pushed them further and further to the wall. Threatening them. Bullying them. Filling the airwaves with the spiralising classes – the patronising Smoothie Millionaires. It was the worst run political campaign in living memory that learned nothing from the insurgent ‘Yes’ campaign that nearly won in Scotland, and everything from the ‘No’ campaign that nearly lost. No wonder millions of people decided it was the moment to speak up. Did we listen? No. Did we hell.  The wall between the silos has actually thickened. Leaving screaming voices desperate to be heard, shut out again, pushed ever further from the centre and into the arms of St Tommy Robinson. In 1936, Orwell watched the same phenomenon, encountering Oswald Mosley on his Road to Wigan Pier. It’s kind of beautul in its circularity. The poorest people vote against the EU that protected their rights and now the richest people will get even richer and capitalism ever more unfettered and rampant. Who wins? Extreme capitalism. The people who funded Vote Leave. Meanwhile in a Britain just outside this shiny city centre, high streets where libraries once stood stand empty, and homeless people huddle in shop doorways and mental health services are closed down and cafes have been replaced by betting shops and cash converters where people queue at 8am on a Monday morning holding their worldly goods in cardboard boxes tied with string. These people haven’t been ‘left behind’. It’s far more sinister than that. The people who did the least to cause the banking crisis have been made to pay for it. We weren’t all in it together, not even close. They’ve not been Left Behind – they’ve been evaded, by those companies who not only evade their taxes but evade their workers’ rights too by the use of shady agency companies straight out of Charles Dickens. They have been Held Back by welfare ‘reform’ – a term I use in its loosest sense. Because nothing better has come from the Bedroom Tax or the shambles of Personal Independence Payments – or from the bitter pill of Universal Credit. There’s no point saying that the principle of UC isn’t a bad one, when it contains at its very core a deep cut – a five to eight week wait with no money coming in.  I can’t go into everything that’s wrong with the government’s welfare reform programme in 5 minutes. But in its simplest terms –  you go to the foodbank – there’s one less than half a mile from here – and ask what people are doing in there you will 99 per cent likely be told one of three things. Benefit delays, sanctions, or insecure work. None of them an accident. They were part of a devised political plan. To make Austerity work there had to be human collateral, and that has been the poorest and most powerless and vulnerable people in society. There’s even been a particularly nasty narrative alongside it, the scroungers narrative. Who would care about what’s happening to them? The hostile environment created by policies that came out of this conference, was not just for immigrants. It’s your party that has been hijacked by extremists.  If you go to the Easterhouse estate, where Iain Duncan Smith wept, and had his Damascene moment and ask the people there, as I have, whether any of them – ANY – are better off you will be extremely lucky to find a single soul. Even the bloke who showed him round was ashamed. That is the level of total failure and misery I am asking you to confront today. Meanwhile, insecure work is not a fact of le but a symptom of how the 1950s sunny uplands maidens-on-bicycles capitalism beloved of this conference has failed all but wealthiest in this country. Enabled by another myth – that of ‘trickle down wealth’. Funnily enough it was a trickle, a trickle too small to see. But it cascaded at the top, where the rich have got richer and richer and richer since the crash. It’s not the 1950s any more.

In his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of seeking to punish Britain for wanting to leave the EU and compared it to the Soviet Union trying to stop its citizens leaving.  The comment was denounced as unworthy of a British Foreign Secretary by the former head of Foreign Office civil servants Lord Ricketts, while his successor as Permanent Secretary Sir Simon Fraser described it as a shocking failure of judgment.  Meanwhile, Latvia\u0027s ambassador to the UK retorted that the EU had brought her country prosperity, equality, growth, respect after decades in which the Soviet Union ruined the lives of its people. In his speech on Sunday, the Foreign Secretary recalled a visit to Latvia, during which he observed how the Baltic state had developed into a modern democracy, part of both NATO and the EU after breaking free of the Soviet Union. And he asked: What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream? The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.  The lesson from history is clear:  you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out won\u0027t diminish it will grow, and we won\u0027t be the only prisoner that will want to escape.   Lord Ricketts, who was the Foreign Office\u0027s most senior civil servant from 2006-10 before serving as National Security Adviser and ambassador to France, responded on Twitter : This rubbish is unworthy of a British Foreign Secretary.  The EU isn\u0027t a Soviet-style prison. Its legal order has brought peace and prosperity after a century of war. Our decision to leave was always going to leave us worse off. The only punishment is the self-inflicted iety. And Sir Simon Fraser, who led Britain\u0027s diplomats from 2010-15 and is now vice-chair of foreign affairs think-tank Chatham House, said: I agree with Lord Ricketts, my predecessor as Permanent Secretary. Whatever you think about Brexit , shocking failure of judgement for British Foreign Secretary to compare European Union with Soviet Union.  Latvian ambassador Baiba Braze said: Soviets killed, deported, exiled and imprisoned 100 thousands of Latvia\u0027s inhabitants after the illegal occupation in 1940, and ruined lives of 3 generations, while the EU has brought prosperity, equality, growth, respect.

The hardline Brexiteer made the remark to a packed crowd at a fringe meeting at the party’s annual gathering in Birmingham. He was referring to the Great Socialist People\u0027s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which was the name of Libya under Colonel Gaddafi. Labour MP and Best for Britain champion Alex Sobel MP said: This not only shows the same sort of casual racism Boris Johnson has displayed but also a disdain for the rest of the World which would leave us isolated and economically eviscerated  he is allowed his hard Brexit  Mr Rees-Mogg was telling party faithful he thought using the term “people’s vote” sounded totalitarian. He said: “All the countries who are least interested in their people call themselves ‘people\u0027s’, don’t they? “So the People’s Republic of China? Oh, that’s communist. “And the People’s Republic of…jam jar, or something like that, of Libya, was what it was called when Colonel Gaddafi was in charge.” The term Jamahiriya roughly translates as “state of the masses”. Lib Dem frontbencher Christine Jardine said: “This sort of remark is becoming too common from the Brexiteers, coming as it does in the wake of Boris’s recent burka jibes.  Insulting other people is not the way I want my country represented and the public see it for what it is, petty politics.” He went on to declare Theresa May’s Chequers deal “the deadest of dead ducks in thunderstorms.” Speaking at a rally organised by pro-Brexit website Brexit Central, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I went to Chequers once. “I went to Chequers when Ted Heath was Prime Minister. He gave me Garibaldi biscuits. “I was three at the time, and I thought very highly of Mr Heath because of these Garibaldi biscuits. You see how easily children’s opinions are formed. “But however many Garibaldi biscuits I was given, I would not support Chequers as it is today.” Mr Rees-Mogg said neither the Conservative Party, the Labour Party or the EU would vote for Mrs May’s Chequers deal.

The Work and Pensions Secretary launched an arrogant attack on Labour and social media - despite cuts being well-documented by think tanks and her predecessor Iain Duncan Smith. Most working-age benefits are frozen for four years from 2016/17 to 2019/20 - a cut to families\u0027 real income. The government\u0027s own 2015 Budget said this would cut \u0026pound4billion a year from the benefits bill. Meanwhile, new benefit Universal Credit is widely agreed to be less generous than it was designed to be thanks to cuts by ex-Chancellor George Osborne. Its founder, Tory Iain Duncan Smith, said \u0026pound2billion more must be put in to restore it - while the National Audit Office has cast doubt on its claim to make work pay. Tories have axed housing benefit for under-22s, only to U-turn and ditch the policy. They\u0027ve introduced a \u0026pound20,000 cap on household benefits. And hundreds of thousands of previous claimants have been denied disability benefits under the new Personal Independence Payment. Yet Ms McVey - who has herself been forced to correct misleading statements about benefits - appeared to suggest all these facts were fake news because the total amount of money put into thebenefits system has gone up.  She told Tory members in Birmingham: If you were to believe everything you heard from Labour or read on social media you\u0027d think we were somehow letting down the most vulnerable in society - especially disabled people. However, those who say we are cutting budgets are peddling fake news. So here’s the real news - we have never spent more on those with disabilities and long-term health conditions. We spend over \u0026pound50billion a year, up \u0026pound9billion on 2010. Ms McVey said she became a Conservative to stand against the ugly, destructive, Marxist, Militant, socialists of the past.  Blasting the pro-Corbyn campaign group, she told members: Momentum is the modern day Militant - and remember there are three M\u0027s in Momentum - Militant, Militant, Militant. Can you imagine it, this country with Corbyn, McDonnell and Abbott at the helm? It would be a political nightmare, with Labour doing what it always does - leaving office with higher unemployment than it inherited. She added: Remember what John McDonnell said about me? That I should be lynched. Well he picked on the wrong woman!  .     In a new policy, Ms McVey announced the Citizens Advice Bureau is set to receive \u0026pound39million to help Universal Credit claimants under the Universal Support scheme. The cash will fund advisers to help claimants get their first payment on time and be ready to manage it when it arrives.

Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of 2018, where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesn\u0027t somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.  It\u0027s day one, and they\u0027ve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, he\u0027s been impersonated by Phil \u0027Voldemort\u0027 Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David \u0027Mine Are No Better\u0027 Davis.  We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasn\u0027t someone else, and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.  We all know what\u0027s happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isn\u0027t someone else.  So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories? 1. Project Oh Dear   Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.  Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. It\u0027s a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing. 2. Project You Can\u0027t Be Serious  Having toured the country in a bus promising to give our EU subscription to the NHS, the Tories have since said: a we\u0027ll still have to pay a subscription b it will be higher, without a rebate  c by the way, we\u0027ll be cutting \u0026pound2.7bn off the NHS  Today the spiritual leader of the Brextremists has suggested we spend our foreign aid budget on saving elephants, because they remind him of Beethoven\u0027s Fth Symphony. Hang the education projects, stuff the small-scale charities who exist entirely because of foreign aid, and let\u0027s get all worked up about the 70 pence in every \u0026pound100 national profit that we spend on foreigners. Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what? 3. Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.  It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding 15 months after it burned 72 people alive, and only  it\u0027s on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.  It also won\u0027t matter  you sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, or  you don\u0027t have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you won\u0027t want to live anyway. 4. Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesn\u0027t want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.  All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now, 6 months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.  Patrick Kielty\u0027s dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories\u0027 border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend there\u0027s a border where there isn\u0027t one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across 300 miles of hedge that we can\u0027t police. Laugh? You\u0027ll die. 5. Project It All Onto Someone Else   Presiding over economic chaos? Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the People\u0027s Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That?   Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, that\u0027s too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EU\u0027s crazy rules about bovine TB which isn\u0027t harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesn\u0027t kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccine  only we could be bothered.  When someone says \u0027but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers!\u0027 point out we still have to abide by EU rules  we want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And don\u0027t, for heaven\u0027s sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.  With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, you\u0027re looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.  You\u0027ll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we haven\u0027t dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything else that moved because, after Brexit, they\u0027ll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past 40 years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

Jack Poore was cycling to school when he was hit with a mystery acidic substance - thought to be mixed with toy slime. His mother, Tara, 37, received a panicked call from her son and immediately thought that Jack had been the victim of an acid attack. The schoolboy wiped the sludge from his neck and fell to the grass - with his body feeling like \u0027it was on fire\u0027.  He was able to make it into his school reception, where staff were able to prise the rest of the \u0027green slime\u0027 off his neck area.

But despite her initial hesitation, she found herself agreeing to sit back and let her fianc\u0026eacute take the reigns in the lead-up to the big day.  From the venue to invites, entertainment and and even Sarrah\u0027s wedding dress , groom-to-be Abs Hassanali made all the decisions himself.  And fortunately, his hard work paid off - because his bride loved it all. I\u0027m a lot more picky than Sarrah and my nature suited me to take charge of wedding preparations, Abs told . Apparently, men are a lot less hands on with wedding organising, something that definitely needs to change.  But from the venue, to the invitations, decoration, food, cake, entertainment, photographers and even Sarrah\u0027s dress and bouquet, I took the lead. Sarrah was hesitant at first to give me the reigns, but I\u0027m just glad I could provide her with the wedding of our dreams. The 27-year-old, from London, continued: Much of the day was a surprise to her and I\u0027m amazed  I could pull it all off. I think our wedding really bucked the trend and showed that men can put together just as an extravagant wedding as women. Sarrah, who wore a stunning pink and gold saree dress for the ceremony, added: Our wedding exchanged the traditional role-play scenario.  I\u0027m the one who pushed to propose and get us engaged while all the organisation for the wedding was led by my husband-to-be. I\u0027m amazed as to how well he managed to pull it all off. Abs had been thrilled when his marketing graduate partner, 28, popped the question in August 2016, two years after they met at a pal\u0027s BBQ. But as the far more particular half and determined to give his fianc\u0026eacutee the wedding of her dreams, he suggested that he organise the big day. In a move many brides-to-be would balk at, Sarrah ended up agreeing. She was really hesitant for me to take the reigns at first but I assured her early on, said Abs, a PR consultant who lives in Harrow.  He added that although he did worry his partner wouldn\u0027t like particular elements of the wedding, his first decision was a huge hit. I have good knowledge on Sarrah\u0027s taste - it comes with the territory of getting married to her, I guess, he told us. In fact, we dfer on all kinds of tastes, including movies, food, gadgets, wallpaper and even clothes! So the pressure was definitely on. I did a very good first job  on the invitations - creating our logo, an invitation video and bespoke invitation cards, so she was overjoyed with the results and trusted me a lot more thereafter. He continued: Of course, with most joint wedding decisions, I took initial input from Sarrah and offered options to choose from. But in terms of deciding the theme and looks, contacting vendors, shortlisting them and ultimately choosing our supplier, it was all me.   Abs went on to choose Sarah\u0027s wedding dress, organise a river boat reception and book their venue - the Moat Room at Harrow Registry Office. In an incredible twist of fate, unbeknown to him, his own parents Asgarali and Durraiya Hassanali had wed in the exact same room 37 years earlier. His mum Durraiya had even worn a similar dress to his bride-to-be\u0027s gown. [I] had coincidently chosen the exact same room, he said. In the lead-up to the wedding, Abs also ordered a spectacular, nine-tier wedding cake for him and Sarrah, as well as sorting out photographers and decorations. I visited hundreds of wedding outfitters every Saturday and Sunday consistently for four months, he recalled.  I would book consultations in the week and fill up my diary and visit them on the weekend. Most were surprised to see me just walk through the front door. It was often assumed that my other half was parking the car, until elapsed time uncovered otherwise. He added: Asian weddings are a little less traditional white dress for the bride and suit for the groom. It’s all about colour. It\u0027s also a tradition in our culture that a gt is given from the groom to the bride to use at the reception - clothes, bouquet, jewellery etc. I just made it my quest to make it all of these! And on the day itself, Sarrah - who had been visiting the UK from Sri Lanka when she first met Abs at the BBQ - was delighted. Abs is far more methodised and particular than I am and it paid idends for our big day, said the bride, whose dress was designed by Jaan London.  He\u0027s my le partner and I\u0027m so proud of all that he\u0027s done for us. It\u0027s the dream start to our long future together. Abs, who shed a tear as Sarrah walked down the aisle, added: We were able to fulfil the wedding of our dreams on a boat on the River Thames. The wedding reception was held on the largest boat on the river, the Dixie Queen, that included the opening of Tower Bridge. The couple were joined by 200 of their family and friends on their big day, including the Mayor of Harrow, Councillor Kareema Marikar. Cllr Marikar knew my we in Sri Lanka before we met due to both their roots, said Abs. She was instrumental in bringing us together. Meanwhile, the groom\u0027s parents did a double take as they stepped into the wedding venue and realised they had married there in 1981.  Abs said: It was an absolute honour to be married in the same room of the same building as my parents did 37 years ago. I know it was nostalgia for my parents to be back there all those years later, too. What we didn’t realise, until my parents actually walked in on the wedding day, is that we had coincidently chosen the exact same room. He added: Almost four decades on, and four children and five grandchildren later, their marriage is just as strong today, as it was then. I began married le in the same manner as them and so I hope that my union remains just as endearing for just as long.

Chris Lewis, from the Rhondda in Wales - who\u0027s known as Curly because of his corkscrew locks - has been running the hugely popular Curlys Dinners for the past 14 years. Claiming to be the first Sunday dinner delivery service in the Rhondda, the company specialises in takeaway roasts, served in a polystyrene tray. Costing between \u0026pound4.50 for children and \u0026pound6.50 for adults, each portion comes with a choice of meat, vegetables, roast potatoes, stuffing, Yorkshire pudding and a pot of Curly\u0027s popular homemade gravy. There\u0027s also a choice of homemade desserts, like jam roly-poly and custard or chocolate fudge cake and cream, which start from around \u0026pound1.50. Facebook reviews rate the dinners as 4.8 out of 5, with many reviewers describing the food as beautul, fantastic, good value for money and the best Sunday dinner I\u0027ve ever tasted.  Despite only opening the shop on a Sunday, preparation work starts as early as Friday for Chris and his team, as they get ready for the weekend ahead. We prep all week - Friday we have our deliveries, Saturday we prepare the food, Sunday we\u0027re flat out all day, 43-year-old Chris, a former pub chef, told Wales Online . Starting at an eye-wateringly early 5am, Chris then works constantly until around 4pm on a Sunday. He estimates that his team - which is made up of around eight staff members - prepare, cook and sell between 350 and 380 roast dinners, as well as a number of desserts, every week. This means the company could potentially be making upwards of around \u0026pound28,000 a year JUST by opening on a Sunday. I can manage enough on a Sunday to be closed the rest of the week, Chris said. We sell out mostly every week. We try to keep the prices as low and as reasonable as we can, with plenty of food. I was brought up in the valleys, so I\u0027m used to nice, big plates.  Chris describes his service as a production line and from prepping the veg to pouring the gravy and cooking the meat, everyone on his team has their own inidual jobs. My team is awesome - we\u0027re like a well-oiled machine and they\u0027ve been with me for a long time, Chris said. Everyone has got their own inidual job. Someone is on the phone, someone is on the till, the girls put the veg on the plates and I cook the meat. After leaving school, Chris worked in a fish shop for two years before training to become a chef at his local pub. He spent more than 12 years cooking at the pub, and it was this experience that sparked the idea for his future business. We\u0027d do Sunday dinners at the pub every week and a lot of people would pop in and ask  they could take the dinners away, Chris said. Only around 10-15 people would come in and eat, but loads of people would take dinners away. I could see how popular it was, so when a shop became available I decided to go on my own. Around 14 years ago, Chris took the plunge and opened up his own business in the form of Curlys Dinners. Originally opening as a caf\u0026eacute/diner, the venue had a seating area and a salad/breakfast bar, as well as the takeaway roast dinner service on a Sunday.  We were open for around four years and then I had kids and it all got too busy, Chris said. We closed and I ended up working in a factory for a while. But it wasn\u0027t long before Curlys re-opened. When we first re-opened, we were still serving food throughout the week, he said. But after the local bank closed the amount of visitors we had to the caf\u0026eacute dropped. So, we decided to keep it to a Sunday, make it a takeaway service and pour all of our resources into that. We took on more delivery drivers, worked longer hours and it took off from there. Curlys now produces hundreds of roast dinners every month, and the company has established itself as a real player on the Valleys food scene, with queues out the door most weeks. But, there\u0027s one month in particular that gets really busy. Christmas is always really busy, Chris said. We\u0027re usually fully booked by December 1, and we get orders in as early as September. We\u0027ve had a hundred orders this year aleady. Christmas dinners at Curlys sell out every year, and costing just \u0026pound12 for dinner and dessert it\u0027s not hard to see why. Each festive dinner - which is prepared and picked up on Christmas eve - comes with a choice of meat, potatoes , vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, stuffing, gravy and, of course, pigs in blankets. There\u0027s also a vegetarian option and a choice of desserts, including Christmas pudding with brandy sauce. Because our building is so small, we can only do a certain amount of Christmas dinners - but they sell out every year, Chris said. The winter can be quite dficult, especially when it snows.

Tanya Cox, 38, from Hull, has been working in the industry since she was 27 but says she often thinks about getting a real job. She was scouted as a glamour model while working as a lap dancer and says her past experience enabled her to be comfortable in front of the camera. Despite loving her job, Tanya says she thought about giving up her career when jobs dried up after she turned 30, reports the Hull Daily Mail.  However, she\u0027s now finding success again as she breaks into the \u0027mature market\u0027. How did you get into modelling and was it something you always wanted to do? I never really thought about doing any modelling work but whilst I was working as a lap dancer, I got approached by an agency and was asked  I would consider doing any modelling work.     I was quite shocked as I thought you had to be tall and skinny to do any kind of modelling but they reassured me that was just the fashion industry and that I was perfect for glamour. How old were you and how long have you been doing it? I came into the industry at 27 and I’m now 38. What was it like at first and what kind of things you were doing? Having already worked as a lap dancer for three years, I was very comfortable with modelling straight away. I think its the taking your clothes off bit that worries most new glamour models but as I had already been doing that for three years, that was the easy part, it was learning to find the light and what angles suited me that took the time the learn. Was you aware of any challenges the industry faced at the beginning? No, when I first came into the industry, everything seemed great, people were much more reliable with higher standards always putting quality first back then. But now its more quantity over quality and trying to get as much as possible shot in the time frame are booked for. Was there ever a point where you regretted getting into modelling? When I first turned 30, my work really quietened off as some companies considered me too old for the young market but I still looked too young to break the mature market. It was a very low point in my le and feeling my career slip away made me so depressed at times that I wished I never started. What has been the best things about it? Are there any moments which stand out where you loved it? I think for me, it helped me to find my own inner strength. I was guilty of never sticking up for myself when I was younger but now I\u0027m the first to say when anyone is out of order, whether it\u0027s towards myself, a friend or even a stranger. Also through modelling and dancing, I have now met the best friends that I have ever had. I trust them completely and never doubt anymore that they all love me, as much as I love them. What has been some of the worst things about it? The worst thing about modelling is the high cancellation rates which has been getting worse and worse each year since 2010, but I don\u0027t think that is just an industry problem, I think society in general has forgotten its manners because I have noticed that more and more people cancel social meets with friends than ever before too.  Have you ever been judged based on your career? What do you think of that? Not in my personal le, but since my work started to quieten off and I have been trying to get a \u0027normal job\u0027, I do feel like employers are discriminating against me as I don\u0027t even seem to be able to get an interview these days, and when I was younger I always found it so easy to get work. When a place I worked at closed down, I had a new job within a week. How successful have you been? I felt pretty successful when I was younger but I do think I would of had a better career had I started when I was younger as it only lasted a few years before my peak ran out. I am now just starting to finally break the mature market, so fingers crossed I can make a success of that, but early days yet. Modelling must have changed since you started - have you seen that and in what way? It certainly has, all the technology keeps changing, I don\u0027t know how the photographers keep up. And unfortunately the budgets aren\u0027t as big anymore. I really miss the days of make-up artists and clothing departments on all shoots, but these days its only the very biggest companies that provide those now and for most shoots we just get a list of what types clothing to bring with us and have to do our own hair and make-up. Do you think it will change in the future and in what way? We are seeing dferent types of models coming through now We are and I love that we are now celebrating ersity with models now coming in dferent shapes, sizes, styles and ages. I met a new model on set recently who had just started doing topless modelling at 52. Social media has also come to the forefront and many models experience trolling - is that something you\u0027ve experienced? Yes, I have had a few negative comments but, for every bad comment I get, there is always at least 20 positive comments to counter-act it and the troll then usually ends up getting loads of grief for his/her comment anyway so it always back fires on them.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are also about to embark on a royal tour, visiting Australia and New Zealand later this month for their first overseas tour as husband and we.  The couple, who were married in May, were invited to visit these countries by their respective local governments, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office requesting that they also visit Fiji and Tonga.  The 16-day visit will coincide with the 2018 Invictus Games, which kick off in Sydney on October 20. But who exactly is footing the bill for this rather exciting trip?

A spokesman said: In common with all Realm visits, the costs of the visit will be met by the host governments.   They added that any costs related to the Invictus Games part of the programme will be covered by the Invictus Games Foundation, which Prince Harry is patron of.  During the tour, all eyes will be on the Duchess of Sussex as she gets to grips with becoming one half of a royal tour double act.  The couple will be following in the footsteps of Harry\u0027s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, whose first official tour upon entering into married le was also to Australia and New Zealand.  During that trip, Charles and Diana travelled 23,601 miles and spent a total of 41 days overseas.   The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also visited the same places, being away for 18 days and covering 23,701 miles.  Meghan has revealed she\u0027s really looking forward to the upcoming tour. Speaking as part of ITV\u0027s new royal documentary Queen of the World, Meghan said she\u0027s feeling very excited and hinted that the pair plan on doing more travelling in the near future.

Bronya Thompson, 30, is hoping as many people as possible send her son Alfie a card for his eighth birthday as he loves opening and reading them. The youngster is non-verbal and can only communicate using sign language. He also has a rare chromosome deletion and is one of just eight who suffer from the condition in the world.  Bronya said that due to Alfie\u0027s health battles and his struggles to speak he has just a handful of friends as he really struggles to make them and there were only six other children in his class at school. Alfie also has a small family but his mum wants to get him a few more cards for him to open on his birthday on Saturday, October 13, to show how loved he is and teach him that it doesn\u0027t matter that he is dferent. She said: Alfie doesn\u0027t like toys but loves cards and reading them. It would be amazing to get him a few more he can open on his day to show how loved he really is, and it doesn\u0027t matter  you\u0027re dferent. We will never know  speech will ever come. He also has hypermobility and struggles to walk and needs a wheelchair, but as you can see from his smile he has a great sense of humour.  Bronya said she also wanted to raise awareness of her son\u0027s condition, and that  members of the public see an older child who appears to be having a tantrum, they are probably having a meltdown. I\u0027ve had a lot of people tut and give comments when Alfie been screaming in town, she added. It\u0027s important to remember you cannot always tell that someone is autistic by looking at them. Autism is a disability, not a disease, and does not go away. Everyone who has autism is dferent, some may need more support and some may need less. People with autism find it hard to express themselves, say what they need, or how they feel.

Overnight, the lowest temperature recorded was -1.7C in Eskdalemuir, Scotland, while it was -1.7C at Kielder Castle, Northumberland.  A few places dipped to under 0C, the Met Office said, but conditions should improve amid sunshine today and over the course of the week.  And despite a chilly start to the week, by Wednesday and Thursday temperatures will even be slightly above average.  High pressure will be in charge for much of the rest of the week bringing balmy weather for large swathes of Britain, while staying cloudy most of the time, the Weather Channel says. The best of the warmth will be in the south-east where the mercury could reach 21C by midweek. There is a risk of some sharp showers in the north-west where low pressure and associated cold fronts brush the fringes of Scotland, forecasters say.  But generally for the rest of the UK, there will be some mild days with brightest weather in the north and spells of drizzle possible further south. Winds will be stronger in northern areas of Scotland with a chance of gale force gusts, but it should stay calmer in southern regions and the Midlands. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “It will be mostly dry with a mixture of cloud and bright, or sunny, spells under higher pressure extending eastwards from the Atlantic. “Temperatures will be around normal and above normal in the south and nearing 20C although there could be some rain for the North Sea coasts.” "},{"url":null,"title":"devastated mum says four year","story":"NewsBoy, 4, \u0027thrown to death\u0027 from seventh-floor rooftop by big brother - who then led police to bodyShimron Smith, four, was found dead in the courtyard of an apartment block in Brooklyn, New York and his older brother Shawn Smith, 20, has been charged with second-degree murderShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill10:11, 1 OCT 2018Updated10:50, 1 OCT 2018NewsShimron Smith, four, was found dead after being \u0027thrown off apartment block roof by older brother\u0027 \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old boy was allegedly thrown to his death from a rooftop by his big brother - who later led police to the body.

Tania Copeman, 41, was exploring The Village in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, with Ghost Hunts UK last month when she felt \u0027compelled\u0027 to take two pictures before she left. Tania and her husband Jared, 47, were shocked when one photo showed an \u0027evil-looking\u0027 pale face peering at the out of the gloom, with glowing white eyes - despite no one having been there. Ghost hunter Lee Roberts, who had taken them on the tour that evening, reckons the \u0027creepy\u0027 face could be one of the seven monks who burned to death there in the 1500s.  Tania, who travelled a five-hour round trip from her home in Watton, Norfolk to visit the reportedly haunted location, said: I didn\u0027t really expect to capture anything really. But I\u0027d always wanted to go to The Village. I\u0027d heard about that place for a long time and always wanted to go. Jared and I had gone into that section, which we later found out is exactly where they think the priests were burned alive. After we\u0027d done some investigating in that room but hadn\u0027t found anything, I just had the inkling to take two more pictures. I even said to Jared when we left \u0027let me take two more\u0027 - and that\u0027s when that appeared. But I didn\u0027t notice the figure until later when I was looking through my photographs. I saw the two eyes but at the time I didn\u0027t realise they were eyes - I thought they were just two white dots. But then I zoomed in on the picture and I saw this face and I was like \u0027oh my god\u0027.  I shouted Jared and he said straight away that it was a face. After Tania and Jared showed Lee what they had captured, he checked the CCTV to rule out that anyone else had been in that room with them when the photo was taken. When CCTV confirmed the duo were indeed supposed to be alone in the room, they admitted it was \u0027really creepy\u0027. Tania, a cleaner, said: I was excited to capture something. But then the doubt springs into your mind - could it be a reflection of something? You constantly think, what  it\u0027s not something paranormal? But now that everything has been checked. We\u0027ve confirmed no one else was there, there was nothing there to reflect off - so now it is a wow, what have a caught? The face does look burnt. So it makes me think I might have caught one of the priests that was burnt there. I don\u0027t know. It makes you think - what is it? Who is it? It makes me want to go back there and do some more investigating. It\u0027s certainly not put me off at all.  Lee says he has tried to recreate the photo and checked the area to ensure there is nothing there that could have made up the shape of a face and is now convinced it is paranormal. The 42-year-old runs Haunted Events UK and also takes groups of ghost hunters on tours of The Village, which was a malthouse and pub after being a slaughterhouse and is a grade-II listed building. Lee said: [Tania and Jared] were both frightened and excited by what they captured. You could tell they had been on ghost hunts before so they were excited. But at the same time they were also wary about going back down there because of the nature of what it looks like. Whether it is a nasty entity or something that it quite nice, because it looks quite evil-looking, it automatically puts that into people\u0027s minds. I am quite scientic-minded so the first thing I had to rule out was that it was not something there causing it or pareidolia - and it wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m wary of saying things are paranormal but we cannot explain this so therefore this is paranormal. There was nothing there to explain. It looks quite evil and demonic. But that\u0027s not to say that it is. That could be just the first form of manestation and that\u0027s the way it\u0027s been caught in the picture. Even stranger, Tania claims she felt a burning sensation on her face in the same area - before Lee had even told them that monks had been burned alive there.

The red-eared slider was given to a wildle rescue shelter in Shangrao city in East China\u0027s Jiangxi province. Officials say they will not release it into the wild because it may not survive on its own - and might lead to unwanted effects in the turtle gene pool. The red-eared slider is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, and is considered an invasive species in China and other countries in the world due to their popularity as pets. Wildle rescue shelter staff member Tu Jun said: It is a red-eared slider, but its probability of survival is very low because of the mutation.  Footage of the two-headed hatchling appears to show it full of le despite the freakish mutation. It is being kept in a plastic tank where members of the public can visit it. Tu added: It eats the same thing [as other turtles], but the chances of regular owners keeping it alive are slim.

The three masked men approached her dad - who had just ed home from work in a white 4x4 - and held him up at gunpoint to steal his cash while one of the gang raided the family home. The group ran back down the driveway in the opposite direction - with the only person between them and their getaway motorcycles being the little girl, who was walking back to see what the noise was.

It is hard to defend United manager Csaba Laszlo now and it would be no surprise  he is given his jotters after this most horric of days.It started when eventual hat-trick hero and former Tangerine Billy Mckay opened the scoring from close range on 11 minutes, knocking in a Josh Mullin cross.The only chink of light in the game came six minutes later as Pavol Safranko got on the end of Fraser Aird\u0026#8217s delivery to guide the ball past Scott Fox in the away net.From there United laboured and County took advantage. Scoring the most simple and avoidable goals \u0026#8211 often carbon copies of each other.The second came on 29 minutes after a Jamie Robson mistake played in Mullin to square for Mckay to knock in.On 41 minutes the same problems United had faced all game down their left-hand side were there for all to see as Sean Kelly inswinging free-kick went all the way through past Matej Rakovan in the home net. A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on 50 minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay\u0026#8217s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on 56 minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United\u0026#8217s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

It read:Sandy Davie is back at Tannadice Park.Last night, team manager Jim McLean completed a transfer deal for the big goalkeeper, an ex-Scotland U/23 cap.It’s three-and-a-half years since Davie  left United for Luton Town for a transfer fee of £8,000.He then joined Southampton two years later.The circle was completed yesterday when Sandy ed for his second spell with United.There was no fee involved.After the transfer, Davie, now 27, said: “I can hardly believe this.“The move came right out of the blue.“I’ve been hoping to get away from Southampton for some time, simply because of the consistency of Eric Martin  gave me little chance of a first-team place.“In my term there, I played just four games for the league side.“But the transfer deadline came and passed, and so did the end of the season.“I thought my chances of an early transfer were slender.“Even at that, I never dreamed that Dundee United would come for me again.”Sandy is married with two young sons.He’ll sell his Southampton house and move north as soon as possible.He’ll be a very valuable member of the Tannadice pool. A point stressed by Jim McLean.Said the boss: “With Donald Mackay away, I need another experienced goalkeeper to join Hamish McAlpine. “Sandy Davie fits the bill.”When Davie left Tannadice, McAlpine was the No 3 keeper, just beginning to challenge Davie and Mackay.McLean also announced that Davie will go on tour with United to Nigeria next week — provided all formalities can be completed in time.Soon after signing, Davie was on the receiving end of ‘jags’ for the trip.It means that 17 Tannadice players will now be making the tour, and it’s an ideal opportunity for Davie to get into the swing of things.On leaving Tannadice for a second time a year later, he emigrated to New Zealand, and played for North Shore United, Mount Wellington and Napier City Rovers.Davie was also capped for New Zealand on 11 occasions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5bae2d6329cb5-e1538141957941.jpg ","title":"blether this is when east fife previously scored six goals away from home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEach week, BwB gives a sample from the Readers’ Queries file in the old Sporting Post.SP Query – On April 20, 1991, ‘Edinburgh East Fe Fan’ asked: Prior to the recent 6-3 win over Alloa, when was the last time East Fe scored six goals away?SP answer – You’ve had to wait over 27 years.

They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-festive-old-firm-derby-date-confirmed","story":"                          THE final Rangers and Celtic clash of the year has been announced."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-striker-leigh-griffiths-to-show-humility-with-his-celebrations","story":"                          Even as the goals start to come for Leigh Grfiths, there has still been a little rebuke from his manager."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"                          THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-3-motherwell-1-comeback-kings-strike-again-as-curtis-main-lets-kilmarnock-off-the-hook","story":"                          COMEBACK kings Kilmarnock roared back from behind for the second week in a row as Greg Stewart\u0027 virtuoso display helped them turn over Motherwell at Rugby Park."},{"url":null,"title":"major-search-for-young-coatbridge-woman-who-vanished-from-her-family-home-distressed","story":"                          A MAJOR search has been launched for a young Coatbridge woman who has been dealing with personal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"young-man-24-whose-disappearance-is-out-of-character-could-be-in-glasgow","story":"                          POLICE searching for a young man whose disappearance a week ago has been described as \u0027out of character\u0027 believe he could be in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"major-retailer-signals-interest-in-new-retail-park-at-former-barrhead-nestle-site","story":"                          Developers of a former pet food factory in Barrhead have announced the first company who will set up shop as part of a \"state-of-the-art\" retail park."},{"url":null,"title":"this-morning-to-celebrate-30-years-with-birthday-party-live-in-glasgows-george-square","story":"                          DAYTIME favourite This Morning will celebrate 30 years on air with a birthday party in Glasgow\u0027s George Square."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-author-helen-fitzgerald-behind-new-bbc-drama-the-cry-explores-every-parents-worst-nightmare","story":"                          FORGET Bodyguard.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in 2016-17 by \u0026pound31.1 million. As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0027 invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0027 not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0027 investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0027 second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0027 finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0027 a dficult balancing act but it\u0027 certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Monday 1 Oct 2018 2:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Response to Charlie tale stuns cat owner","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMarie MacIver, who lives in Hilton and relies on disability benefit, lives alone with her five-year-old cat Charlie.She got in touch with the Courier after it became apparent that Charlie\u0027 injured leg needed an X-ray, which she could not afford.She had already contacted animal welfare charities without success.After we printed the story last week, we were inundated with offers of help for little Charlie \u0026ndash and Mrs MacIver admitted she was moved to tears.\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what I would have done without everyone who offered to help, she said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been in tears because people have been so nice.

There was no notion of parking the bus – instead McInnes wanted to drive a bus through a Celtic defence that had looked vulnerable this season.It nearly paid off as only a goal-line clearance and superb Craig Gordon save denied the Dons.The Reds could not secure back-to-back wins at Parkhead for the first time since 2004 but they threatened to do it.Ironically Aberdeen probably played better in this game than in the 1-0 win in May but still left empty handed.This was a high pressure game for defending Premiership champions Celtic after suffering their worst league start in 20 years.Aberdeen’s endeavours deserved a  from Parkhead but the harsh reality is they are now 10 points behind leaders Hearts after just seven games.They must  to winning ways to slash that dference.Celtic created the first opportunity in the second minute when James Forrest shot wide from 15 yards. Next Niall McGinn drilled a powerful low effort inches wide from the edge of the box.The woodwork denied Celtic in the 25th minute when Odsonne Edouard’s curling 25-yard effort beat ing keeper Joe Lewis only to crack off the post.Celtic were denied a strong penalty claim when Scott McKenna took out Edouard in an accidental coming togeher of the two players.Edouard came off worst and eventually went off injured to be replaced by eventual match winner Sinclair.The influential Mackay-Steven drove at goal and waltzed past two challenges inside the penalty box only to be denied. Keeper Gordon stuck out his left leg to superbly ert his shot wide.From the resultant corner Wilson powered in a header that beat Gordon but Leigh Grfiths was on the line to clear.In the 48th minute Lewis pushed a low drive from Callum McGregor wide for a corner.Moments later Wilson collected the ball on the right, turned sharply and curled in a 25-yard shot that Gordon ed to push wide with his left hand.Aberdeen were becoming increasingly influential and Celtic more frustrated. Which is why to concede while in the ascendancy will have been infuriating for boss Derek McInnes.Celtic went ahead in the 63rd minute when a ball from James Forrest into the box took a deflection off Considine that sent it spinning up into the box.Substitute SINCLAIR used improvisation and awareness to back-heel the ball into the net from six yards.When that goal went in the Hoops’ anxiety at their recent poor form evaporated.But the Reds were still very much in the contest.They should have equalized in the 75th minute when Mackay-Steven whipped in an intelligent free-kick towards the on-rushing Mikey Devlin but with the goal beckoning the defender volleyed it wide.In injury time Grfiths clearly tugged at Devlin’s shirt on the left wing to haul him back and gain an advantage to home in on goal. The ref bizarrely let play continue as the Celtic striker raced on then chipped wide of the advancing Lewis.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sign our petition to change time of aberdeen semi final clash at hampden3","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons fans have branded the decision to make Aberdeen’s League Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden a noon kick-off “an absolute disgrace”.Supporters’ groups, the club and Hearts have all hit out after it was revealed both semi-finals would be played at the national stadium in Glasgow on the same day.And now the Evening Express has launched a petition in an effort to make the SPFL reconsider the ridiculous scheduling of the Aberdeen v Rangers League Cup semi-final on Sunday October 28.The lunchtime kick-off is an outrageous time for fans from the north-east to get to Hampden – and scheduling the Hearts v Celtic semi on the same day at the same venue only compounds the problem.Sign this petition to send a message to the SPFL that’s loud and clear: This showpiece fixture MUST be changed to a new venue or time for the sake of the fans.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/EEbeautylaunchsociety005.jpg-338x564.jpg ","title":"official unveiling for popular aberdeen hair and beauty spot","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery salon gives their clients a makeover, but for LBR the biggest makeover has been of their salon!The popular hair and beauty salon has moved to larger premises in the city’s west end due to customer demand.Owner Kelly-Marie Rose said: “We were on Albert Street but as a growing business when the opportunity came to move into a bigger space I had to take it.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres.

This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo.

It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past 24 years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior/1st male \u0026#8211 Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: 1:10:40Female Senior/1st female –Lucy Fraser 1:15:05Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club 1:17:55Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club 1:10.19.42Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – 1:12:48Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club 1:23:34Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – 1:19:30Female Vintage  – Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club 1:38:22Male Super Vintage  – Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club 1:25:001st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend 1:19:441st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin 1:16:28The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of 1 hour 12 minutes and 56 seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage category  put in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage 70+ age group and won by over 20 minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the 12-mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage race  Alan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the 40+ veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by 20 seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of 25 minutes 33 seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a 31 minute 7 second run being 10 seconds quicker then Phil Dye and 30 seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteran  female category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veteran  category saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of 1:16:28, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at 1:20:51 and Iain MacNicol in third place 1:23:56. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at 1:19:44, in second place was Sarah Grfin at 1:21:33 and Louise Gibson at 1:25:34 in third place.\u0026nbspTeam EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were 13 teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of 7 minutes 52 seconds, followed only 20 seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only 20 seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction 4.0, ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘40 Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.\u0026nbspThanks, and Feedback\u0026nbspMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

For someone with autism, it must surely engender anxiety beyond anything others could imagine.Dean\u0026#8217s presentation at Arrochar\u0026#8217s Three Villages Hall was entitled \u0026#8216Aspergers, anxiety and me\u0026#8217. And it was all about being positive while living with autism.He makes a living touring the world talking about and spreading understanding of autism, but opened in Arrochar by making it clear that he does not claim to represent every autistic person.His attitude is: \u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m going to be autistic until my dying breath, so I\u0026#8217m going to be positive.\u0026#8217Dean went on: \u0026#8216We need to identy the challenges and put support in place, but that doesn\u0026#8217t mean we can\u0026#8217t celebrate the dferences \u0026#8211 the skills, the talents and personalities of our fabulous autistic people.\u0026#8217This year is the 20th anniversary of Dean\u0026#8217s diagnosis of autism and at the beginning, by his own admission, he did not take it well.\u0026#8216I thought friendships, a career, relationships were all out of reach for me because I was on the autistic spectrum.\u0026#8217There followed a gradual acceptance of his condition \u0026#8211 helped, he joked, by online dating  and a realisation that autism is something to be celebrated.Anxiety, though, is an ever-present for Dean. \u0026#8216Research tells us that anxiety is much more of an issue for autistics than the general population,\u0026#8217 he said.Offering some personal tips, he suggested \u0026#8216saying less, but with maximum meaning\u0026#8217 to an autistic person experiencing anxiety. And to stay calm.There are bonuses to being autistic, as Dean outlined. \u0026#8216Nobody experiences joy like an autistic. Most people will never get to that level of happiness and wellbeing.\u0026#8217He ended with a tale from his past. \u0026#8216At the age of seven, I was told that by the age of 30 I\u0026#8217d be in prison. I was suspended more times than you could count. I was made to feel I would need to work to overcome autism.\u0026#8216In the second half of my le, so far I have done lecturing, spoken all over the world, I\u0026#8217m a singer, I do a lot of things. And I came to realise that this was not despite being autistic \u0026#8211 it was because of it.\u0026#8217He concluded: \u0026#8216Autism is not about a list of deficits or deficiencies \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a list of dferences, and dference is good.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council lack of help blasted after lifeline phone peril","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/09/18, 5:52 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowStorm Ali may not have brought the devastation predicted in some quarters, but it did bring down some trees and branches around Mid Argyll.And it left one elderly Lochgilphead couple perilously close to having their leline telecare service cut off on the morning of Wednesday September 19.When a small tree fell from neighbouring land into the garden of Noreen Harvey, it was left resting on the phone line into her home \u0026#8211 which itself was supported by her washing line held up by a clothes pole.Afraid the line would break, 80-year-old Mrs Harvey called Argyll and Bute Council for help shortly after 9am the same day.It wasn\u0026#8217t until the next day , when she called the council again, that she says she was told someone had been out to have a look and it was deemed that the tree had been growing in a private garden, so was nothing to do with the council.Mrs Harvey was left angry at the treatment she received.\u0026#8216The phone line is very important for me and my husband, who is 84, and we rely on it,\u0026#8217 she said. \u0026#8216And the tree wasn\u0026#8217t in a private garden, it was growing in housing association land at the back of my house.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.  Earlier this year, Ms Howat  reshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.  Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! And  I want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work. The leaks will carry on leaking and the Ayrshire Post will carry on printing them. It was the Duke of Wellington who famously said “Publish and be Damned”. If you look out your window, Ms Howat, you can see the square they named after him.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilNorth KoreaAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents. The latest proposed plans are on display at Belleisle Golf Club.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"green-fingered-volunteers-get-gardening-gongs-in-melrose","story":"THE annual Melrose in Bloom awards have been presented.\nHeld at the Ormiston Institute last week, the group\u0026rsquos chairwoman Val Miller handed out a number of top gardening prizes to locals.\nPippa Coles, Abbotsford Gardens and estates development manger, adjudged the Station Hotel to have the \u0026lsquoBest Hotel Floral Display\u0026rsquo and Melrose caravan site to have created the \u0026lsquoBest Other Business Display\u0026rsquo.\nMeanwhile John and Ann Dick picked up the \u0026lsquoBest Private Garden\u0026rsquo accolade.

the roll out won\u0026rsquot be easy to deliver, but that is why this SNP Government has matched its ambition for broadband with \u0026pound600 million of investment \u0026ndash the biggest public investment ever made in a UK broadband project.\n\u0026ldquoI would highlight that the report also praises the Scottish Government for exceeding its target of 95 per cent fibre broadband coverage across Scotland by the end of 2017.\n\u0026ldquoAnd that, due to higher than expected take-up and lower than expected costs, the programme will in fact reach 60,300 more premises than planned \u0026ndash at no extra cost to the public sector.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos absolutely disgraceful that, despite being a reserved matter, the UK Government\u0026rsquos funding contribution to R100 is just three per cent of the total \u0026ndash perhaps Mr Lamont should focus on putting pressure on his colleagues in the Tory UK Government to step up to the plate and better support

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.

The reception also saw the premiere of a video about Mackintosh directed by John Boothman, a booklet about his le, and an exhibition of material from the university\u0026rsquos archives.  Mr Gray said: \u0026ldquoThe JP Mackintosh Committee wanted to mark this anniversary in a way that would pay tribute to his signicant contribution to British politics and contribute to current political debate.  \u0026ldquoThe panel debate at Holyrood brought together speakers from a range of dferent perspectives to consider the topic \u0026lsquowhere now for democracy?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt was a lively and interesting debate and one which I think Mackintosh would have enjoyed.  \u0026ldquoWhether it was promoting devolution for Scotland, pooling our sovereignty with our European neighbours, or his work as a Professor at Edinburgh University, democracy and how to strengthen it was very much at the centre of his political thought and action.  \u0026ldquoThe issues Mackintosh was passionate about remain at the top of the political agenda 40 years on from his death.  \u0026ldquoHis legacy is a powerful one and I\u0026rsquom very pleased we were able to celebrate it in this way."},{"url":null,"title":"finish-line-nears-for-team-running-in-memory-of-much-missed-minister","story":"  Nine family members of the Rev Jenner Macrae \u0026ndash known as Team Jenny \u0026ndash have been taking on a series of gruelling challenges across Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The runners \u0026ndash Jenner\u0026rsquos sister Susan Gibson, along with the late minister\u0026rsquos daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace, and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess, as well as Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry and Kara\u0026rsquos husband Duncan \u0026ndash have been raising funds throughout the summer in aid of Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre.  Jenner died on March 2, aged 63, having been minister of St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May. Then Elaine lined up alongside Clare, 32, Kara, 29, Duncan, 28, and Susan for the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, in July.  The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.  Now the runners are in the home straight and each of them has been overwhelmed by the generosity of members of the public.  Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.  Susan added: \u0026ldquoI think the challenge itself was original and caught people\u0026rsquos imagination but the total is not because of us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of what Jenner was to so many people.

The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable.

It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

In 2017, Leuchie House supported people with more than 35 dferent conditions to benefit from short breaks with 24-hour care.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.  But what was troubling them more was the \u0026ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.  The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.  But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.  They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death?  It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.  It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.  Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents? Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.  Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, for  it had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.  They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in 1603 which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.  It was written into statue by an act in 1609.  The Act called on all \u0026ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and \u0026ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .  And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.  When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.  It said there was a need to set an example to \u0026ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.  It continued: \u0026ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children \u0026ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.  The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be \u0026ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.  They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.  They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in 1624. They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living \u0026ldquoas  they were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be \u0026ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.  The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of 1609 was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other \u0026ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.  Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.  And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.  Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.  The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.  But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy/traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared \u0026ldquonon-settled lestyle.  But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.  They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didn\u0026rsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.  I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about \u0026lsquoTinks\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoGypos\u0026rsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.  The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not \u0026ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.  It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud \u0026ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.  It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the 1609 Act and made my spine shiver.  I didn\u0026rsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.  I\u0026rsquom ashamed about that \u0026ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"  The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It follows a successful bid to attract volunteers to join the community project which is expected to take two years to complete.  Andrew Crummy, the artist behind the Great Tapestry of Scotland and Battle of Prestonpans Tapestry, spoke at a recent event in the Old Town Hall as did Melissa Viguier from the School of Ancient Crafts.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which took place between Wallyford, Musselburgh and Dalkeith on September 10, 1547, has been described as the largest and bloodiest conflict ever fought on Scottish soil.  It began after the English king Henry VIII\u0026rsquos attempts to secure an alliance with Scotland through the marriage of his young son Edward to the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, failed.  Part of a conflict known as the Rough Wooing, it is considered to be the first modern battle in the British Isles and a catastrophic defeat for Scotland.  Now the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group is working with Mr Crummy to make sure the last pitched battle between Scottish and English armies, in which 10,000 were killed, is not forgotten.  The tapestry will be loosely based on the Marian Hangings stitched by Mary, Queen of Scots. Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.  The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.  The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured \u0026pound10,000 from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry. Chief stitcher Liz Neilson and her team will lead the work.  Volunteer stitchers are welcome to attend future workshops at the Old Town Hall from 10am to 1pm on October 13 and 27, November 10 and December 8.  Alister Hadden, treasurer of the Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group, said: \"We were delighted with how well attended the launch event was. It is really good to see so much work being done and we are sure the tapestry will be a huge success, and highlight this important battle.\""},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-resident-greatly-honoured-at-becoming-bha-chairman","story":"  Atholl Duncan will take over from incumbent Steve Harman when he steps down on November 12.

Dr Sentamu, who fled his native Uganda in the 1970s before studying at Cambridge University, was once tipped for the top role of Archbishop of Canterbury but commentators agreed his time had passed after Justin Welby was given the top job in 2013.

Dr Sentamu also thanked the Queen for allowing him to remain in the role beyond his 70th birthday, the point at which it is customary for a bishop to retire.  He will also have the opportunity to continue leading missions in the Northern Province of the Church of England in Liverpool, Southwell and Nottingham, and York.  Paying tribute, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said that Dr Sentamu\u0026rsquos service was something to \u0026ldquorejoice in with great gratitude.

Dr Sentamu, 69, made history in 2002 by becoming the Church of England\u0026rsquos first black senior bishop when he was made the Bishop of Birmingham.

Shaped on the island. Crafted with love.  Essence of Harris is a family run candle and home fragrance business located in the heart of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, created by couple Jamie McGowan, who is originally from Glasgow, and his partner Deenie MacLeod, a Hearach .    Co-founders of Essence of Harris, Jamie and Deenie started their journey into candle and home fragrance by pouring around 12 candles a day on their kitchen table for a small following of island locals. Since the beginning, they have followed the ethos of keeping the brand natural, local and affordable using their beautul island home as inspiration for their products.  They have grown their beloved craft into a bustling candle business, boosting employment within the fragile island economy on the Isle of Harris. Candles were one thing that they both immensely enjoyed having in their home yet there wasn\u0027t anyone creating the products in the Hebrides.  Inspired by the elements of the island, particularly the beaches, they started experimenting with dferent scents and candle making at home. However as the company grew, In its very first year they gained their very own production unit, allowing them to employ a great close-knit team, and supplying to a number of Scottish stockists including the departure lounge of Inverness Airport.  Indeed, with five luxurious scents each named after the stunning west Harris beaches, the \u0027Essence of Harris\u0027 brand is now stocked in over 40 retailers across Scotland with sales abroad also on the increase via sales reps.  There\u0027s a real interest in the candles and home fragrance among tourists who are blown away by the scenery on Harris and want to take a part of Harris home!  \u0026ldquoThe rugged natural beauty of the island inspires everything we do. The product packaging is striking and elemental to reflect the romance, charm and authenticity of the beautul Isle of Harris.

He also described her criticism of Labour\u0026rsquos decision to stop paying her legal bills as \u0026ldquoincredible and \u0026ldquoirresponsible.  Dugdale, who led the party for two years, is being sued for defamation by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland blog.  Labour at a UK level had originally agreed to pay her legal fees, but Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos solicitor was informed recently that the party had changed its mind.  The decision caused widespread anger as Scottish Labour members believed Ms Dugdale has been abandoned half-way through the case.  In an interview last week, Ms Dugdale said: \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party made a promise and it\u0026rsquos not a good look for any political party to fail to keep its promise.  \u0026ldquoThis is what it\u0026rsquos doing to one of its own, so how can people trust that party in any other aspect of le,  this is what\u0026rsquos happening?  But Mr Rafferty, who is the most senior figure in Unite north of the border, said the Lothians MSP could have contributed to the pot with her own cash.  Ms Dugdale, who earns over \u0026pound60,000 as an MSP, angered her colleagues last year after skipping her parliamentary duties to appear on \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! in the jungle in Australia.  She topped up her MSP salary with a pre-tax fee of \u0026pound70,000, some of which she gave to charity.  Mr Rafferty said: \u0026ldquoSome of the comments she has been making are irresponsible, basically saying \u0026lsquoI am not getting the backing in this legal case, and so the party itself cannot be trusted\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoSome party members will be wondering whether this is the same Kezia Dugdale who was in the Australian jungle not that long ago and got \u0026pound70,000 for it. So why is it that party members should be picking up her legal fees?\"  He added: \u0026ldquoI think she should have made a contribution to the legal fees.  Mr Rafferty also said: \u0026ldquoI just think the way that Kezia has attacked the Labour party, her own party, is incredible.  A source close to Ms Dugdale said: \"The last thing Labour members want to hear just now is trade union leaders parroting lines from Wings Over Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"pension-postcode-lottery-in-equal-pay-cases","story":"  In a change to the rules governing the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme, government body the Scottish Public Pensions Agency  stipulated in 2014 that all women with a valid claim for pay discrimination had to have their pensions rerated as part of any settlement.  However, a Freedom of Information request made by this paper has revealed that only a handful of councils immediately complied with the legislation while a number are still not complying and have no intention of doing so.  Argyll \u0026amp Bute Council, which has so far paid out a total of \u0026pound4.8m to settle claims, has not included pensions in any of its pay outs and does not plan to factor them in when dealing with the 120 outstanding claims against it. Similarly, East Ayrshire, which has paid out \u0026pound862,000 in settlements since April 2015, and East Renfrewshire, which has paid out \u0026pound511,000 in that time, have also failed to rerate the pensions of the affected women.  Fe Council, on the other hand, which paid out \u0026pound11.3m in non-pensionable settlements immediately after the legislation was updated, has included pensions in the \u0026pound36.2m it has paid out since. Fe will also factor in pensions as part of settling the 1,100 outstanding claims against it.  East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Highland, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian have also included pensions in recent settlements and will do so for future ones.  The overall result of the dferent approaches is that some women face being discriminated against for the rest of their lives because of the part of the country they lived and worked in, yet no public body will claim responsibility for ensuring the law is enforced.  The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, said that while inidual councils are aware of the pension regulations, \u0026ldquoit is for each employer to consider the appropriate method of settlement and agree the same with the claimants and their representatives.  Audit Scotland, meanwhile, which audits the SPPA, all 32 local authorities and the 11 pension funds that make up the Local Government Pension Scheme, admitted that it did not consider pensions as part of its 2017 report Equal Pay in Scottish Councils. It has also not included the pensions issue in any of the reports it has issued following the annual audit of each inidual authority.  Noting that there are \u0026ldquohighly complex issues around the implementation of equal pay, a spokesman for the body said it is up to local authorities to \u0026ldquoagree the pensionable elements with claimants as part of any settlement.  Even the SPPA, which forced North Lanarkshire Council to include pensions in its settlements after being asked to intervene in 2016, said it has \u0026ldquono powers under pensions legislation to ensure compliance.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are independent bodies of the Scottish Government so negotiations entered into to settle equal-pay claims are a matter for them, an SPPA spokeswoman said. \u0026ldquoIf dferent agreements have been reached it\u0026rsquos for the councils to have ensured they are appropriate and compliant.  Stefan Cross QC of Action4Equality Scotland, who led the case against North Lanarkshire, said this shows that public bodies are \u0026ldquopassing the buck on the issue and failing to uphold the rights of the women the pensions legislation is designed to protect.  \u0026ldquoThe women are left dangling because none of the authorities will take responsibility for upholding the law, he said.  Peter Hunter of the trade union Unison agreed and said that as some women have been receiving the incorrect pension for over a decade, while others have died without ever receiving what they were entitled to, the Scottish Government should intervene.  \u0026ldquoPay is pensionable and therefore equal-pay settlements are pensionable. All this is crystal clear in the law, rulings and guidance on pensions so non-payment of pension contributions for low-paid women is yet another example,  one were needed, of the fact that public bodies need to wake up, he said.  \u0026ldquoMany councils still don\u0026rsquot pay equally, pension fund administrators are inactive in the face of missing millions and auditors still can\u0026rsquot grasp the cost and risk of systemic inequality.  \u0026ldquoThis is a complete system failure. Government has the power to act and the time for action is long overdue.  Despite this, a Scottish Government spokesman, who did not answer questions relating specically to pensions, reiterated the SPPA\u0026rsquos viewpoint that local as opposed to central government should deal with anything related to equal pay.  \u0026ldquoWe have made clear we believe pay discrimination is unacceptable and that equal pay claims should be settled as quickly as possible, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs such as we would urge councils, in line with their legal obligations as employers, to resolve any outstanding claims.  Equal pay and pensions: The history  THE Equal Pay Act 1970 made it illegal for employers to offer men and women dferent employment terms, but it wasn\u0026rsquot until 1997 that a UK-wide agreement was put in place to ensure all local authorities complied with the legislation.  It then took until 2010 for all Scottish councils to implement the so-called single status agreement, with most paying compensation to female workers who had been discriminated against up to that point.  Despite this, all councils went on to receive further equal-pay claims in relation to single status itself. The issues raised included the fact that bonuses that only male staff had been entitled to were protected under the new scheme while the job evaluation element of single status deemed some roles done mainly by women to be less valuable than those done mostly by men.\u0026nbsp  In both rounds of claims most councils treated their settlements as compensation, meaning they were neither taxable nor pensionable. In 2014 HMRC ordered that practice to stop, stressing that all equal-pay settlements must be treated as arrears of pay, with tax and pension contributions becoming due as a result. The rules of the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme were updated to clary the point in the same year.  Not all councils complied, however. In North Lanarkshire, affected women took legal action against their local authority in a bid to have their pensions - which are calculated based on salary - increased to the level they would have been at had they not been underpaid.  In 2016 the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Scottish Public Pensions Agency ordered the council to abide by the law. The effect was to increase the amount the affected women had been paid in the years they were making claims for and, as a result, their pension entitlement too.  The SPPA wrote to all public bodies in the wake of the North Lanarkshire case to \u0026ldquoclary the policy intent that a payment of arrears of pay, made in respect of an equal-pay claim, should be treated as pensionable.  Equal pay and pensions: The impact  LIZ Melrose, who is enjoying a late summer holiday in Tenere, is looking forward to retiring at the end of this year after putting in a 25-year sht at North Lanarkshire Council.  Yet while the thought of entering the next phase of her le is an enticing one, Mrs Melrose admits that money will be tight to begin with because she is taking early retirement and so won\u0026rsquot receive the state pension for another two years.  Despite this, thanks to a fight put up by her and fellow North Lanarkshire staff, the home support worker will be almost \u0026pound1,500 a year better off than she expected to be because the equal-pay settlement she received from the council in 2015 has finally been reflected in her pension.  As a result, Mrs Melrose\u0026rsquos retirement income will rise from \u0026pound5,695 to \u0026pound7,133 a year when she clocks off for the final time in December. While the numbers are not huge, when her state entitlement is factored in in two years\u0026rsquo time it will make the dference, Mrs Melrose says, between being able to continue to take holidays in retirement and not.  \u0026ldquoThat \u0026pound1,500 a year is a substantial increase, she says.  A retired care home warden is in a similar position. Having stopped work 11 years ago after 30 years of service, also with North Lanarkshire Council, the 71-year old had been receiving the incorrect pension every month in the intervening period until, three months ago, it was bumped up by 30 per cent.  It has, she says, \u0026ldquomade quite a big dference to her and her husband\u0026rsquos lives. Her husband agrees, noting that the couple no longer has to be quite so \u0026ldquoguarded about what we\u0026rsquore spending and what we\u0026rsquore not spending.  Yet the outcome is bittersweet, with the woman\u0026rsquos husband noting that due to ill health his we is no longer able to fully enjoy the extra money.  \u0026ldquoThis would have made a big dference to us, a substantial dference, but my we\u0026rsquos heath has deteriorated and deteriorated and she can\u0026rsquot go abroad now because she can\u0026rsquot get insurance, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe both worked all our days and were in the habit of going on a Continental holiday every year until her ill health prevented that. [If the correct pension had been paid from the start] we might have been able to have a winter holiday and a summer holiday.  \u0026ldquoWhen you get to our age you are on the downward slope as regards time."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-denies-knowing-about-alex-salmond-allegation-five-years-ago","story":"  It was reported yesterday that Mr Salmond, who is facing claims of sexual harassment, apologised to a woman for a \u0026ldquomisunderstanding in 2013 and that \u0026ldquono action was taken by the Government.  A Government spokesperson said Ms Sturgeon, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos deputy at the time, had not been aware of concerns raised by the woman.  In January, two women accused Mr Salmond of sexual misconduct when he was First Minister, allegations that were investigated by civil servants.  The probe led to the Government handing over the findings last month to Police Scotland, which has since launched its own investigation.  As revealed by the Herald on Sunday, the police probe is examining a twenty-month period spanning March 2013 to November 2014 - the last month of Salmond\u0026rsquos time in office.  Mr Salmond angrily denounced the internal Government probe, describing the procedure and unlawful and unfair. He denies any sexual harassment and is challenging the civil service process by way of a judicial review.  It was claimed yesterday that one of the women who came forward this year had also made the complaint five years ago.  According to the account, the complaint was resolved after the woman accepted Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos apology for the \u0026ldquomisunderstanding, which took place at Bute House in Edinburgh.  The claims were said to raise questions about why civil servants ordered another investigation this year when the issue had been apparently been dealt with.  Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said:  \"It now appears a complaint was made against Alex Salmond in 2013. If that is true, it contradicts what the public has previously been told about when issues around Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct were first raised, and who dealt with them. It is essential the public is now given a clear timeline of events that have lead to this point, including who knew what - and when.\"  In response to the story, a Scottish Government spokesperson said:  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond. These could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \u0026ldquoNo complaints were raised with the then Deputy First Minister about Alex Salmond under the previous process and, as we have said, the first the First Minister became aware of the fact of an investigation was from Alex Salmond in April 2018.  Asked whether Ms Sturgeon had been aware that a female staffer had complained about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour in 2013, the spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoNo.  On whether the First Minister was aware that the woman had raised concerns about Mr Salmond\u0027s behaviour, the spokesperson gave the same response.  A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: \u0026ldquoWe have no comment to make because our Petition for Judicial Review against the Permanent Secretary is now before the Court of Session. We expect it to be called very shortly and we intend to do our talking in court. Our objective is to establish that Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints procedure used against Alex is unlawful."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8751583.jpg?type=article-full","title":"revealed-the-leaked-document-which-shows-the-scottish-government-has-gone-back-to-the-drawing-board-on-the-merger-of-railway-policing","story":"  The Herald on Sunday can reveal justice minister Humza Yousaf could be ready to roll back on plans to integrate railway policing with the single Scottish force and may concede that there could instead be an informal arrangement with British Transport Police .  An internal document obtained by the Herald on Sunday reveals there are now three merger options on the table, two of which would see officers working in Scotland still employed by British Transport Police Authority, with the Scottish Police Authority  given oversight. When the plan to devolve railway policing was first mooted, three options were suggested by BTP.  But Yousaf\u0026rsquos predecessor Michael Matheson, who is now transport minister, rejected the first two options and spent three years trying to force a takeover of the work of BTP in Scotland. Matheson and Yousaf swapped jobs in First Minister Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos summer cabinet reshuffle.  A discussion paper marked \u0026ldquoOFFICIAL circulated to key stakeholders this week at a meeting chaired by Scottish Government civil servants shows that three options are now under consideration. Option one is a \u0026ldquonon-statutory governance arrangement involving BTP and the SPA, option two is described as a \u0026ldquostatutory route which would give the SPA \u0026ldquoenhanced accountability, and option three is \u0026ldquofull integration, a policy the Scottish Government pursued when Matheson was justice minister. Option three could take eight years to implement, according to the report.  Rail trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs\u0027 Association , which represents BTP staff in Scotland, said the Scottish Government had performed a \u0026ldquoU-turn and called on Sturgeon to sack Matheson for \u0026ldquoincompetence.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said millions of pounds had been spent on an \u0026ldquounworkable merger and Yousaf should now \u0026ldquojunk the original plan altogether.  The s of BTP in Scotland were due to be absorbed into the national force in April next year but Matheson announced in February that the merger had been postponed, amid concerns about IT and pensions arrangements.  The move followed a scathing report from Scotland\u0027s police watchdog which said no authoritative business case was made for the integration. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland, Derek Penman, said a detailed study of the risks should be undertaken.  Penman praised BTP officers and staff for their professionalism amid uncertainty about their position. BTP has 213 officers, 38 police staff and 26 special officers in Scotland, who are charged with looking after 358 stations and 1700 miles of track.  After Yousaf took over the justice department, he announced he would \u0026ldquore-examine all options for the devolution of railway policing, which was originally recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission in 2014.  A Joint Programme Board  was set up in 2017 to integrate BTP in Scotland into Police Scotland. It is chaired by the Scottish Government and UK government\u0026rsquos Department for Transport , and includes representatives from BTP, the SPA and Police Scotland.  A JPB paper circulated this week set out the three options and said each of them \u0026ldquowill be tested on merit as a standalone solution to deliver devolved accountability and responsibility or as part of a phased approach which may progress to full integration to achieve the desired aim.  The report said the SPA does not currently have the s to deliver railway policing. This echoes an SPA report presented to the body\u0026rsquos finance committee last month which said some services may have to be outsourced, resulting in \u0026ldquosignicant dferences to the actual cost base for Police Scotland in integrating BTP-Scotland.  The JPB report, obtained by the Herald on Sunday, states: \u0026ldquoThe options appraisal will provide an evidence-based comparison, considering strategic fit with recommendations from the Smith Commission benefits case risks/impact to the safe and effective management and operational delivery of railway policing in Scotland and the UK and costs \u0026ndash including value for money and affordability.  The document said the timeframe to \u0026ldquogenerate, capture and test the three options will be just over two months, and the justice minister will update the cabinet in early December, with an update provided to MSPs who sit on the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos justice committee by the end of the year.  TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s taken three long years for the Scottish Government to finally accept what our members have told it from the outset \u0026ndash that the breakup of BTP and its merger with Police Scotland was unnecessary and unfeasible.  \u0026ldquoIt continues to be unwanted by anyone connected with our railways in Scotland because it puts passengers and our members at peril. Let\u0027s face it, BTP and Police Scotland themselves never wanted it either.  \u0026ldquoThe U-turn is the right thing to do. It\u0027s just a crying shame it\u0027s taken them so long to make it. The paper circulated at the Joint Programme Board earlier this week represents a signicant change of heart away from the entrenched nationalism surrounding the earlier decision by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  Cortes praised Yousaf for \u0026ldquohaving the decency to review the merger and the \u0026ldquopolitical courage to force his party to accept that it made a mistake.  The union leader said BTP staff and officers deserve an apology and \u0026ldquorecompense for the unnecessary amount of stress and anxiety forced upon them by Matheson\u0027s idiotic policy for the last three years.  An impact report by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research  found that 83 per cent of staff and officers who took part in a survey were unsupportive of the merger. \u0026ldquoThe responses to the online survey demonstrated a deep strain of scepticism, cynicism and opposition towards the integration of BTP s into devolved policing structures, said the report.  Co-author of the SCCJR report Dr Kath Murray welcomed the decision to consider the original options. \u0026ldquoIt suggests a sht away from full integration as an end in its own right, towards an effective devolution arrangement, the criminal justice researcher told the Herald on Sunday. \u0026ldquoRetaining the single specialist service within a devolved accountability structure would allow railway policing in Scotland to be underpinned by principles set by the Scottish Government, build on the respective strengths of the BTP and Police Scotland, and crucially, remove the signicant challenges to date, including the risks to public safety and costs to the public purse.  The TSSA\u0026rsquos Cortes said reasoned arguments made to Matheson about the impact of the merger on staff and officers fell on \u0026ldquodeaf ears. \u0026ldquoHe never once got that safety and crime prevention on our railways is far too important to be treated like a political football, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s why we now have deep reservations about his position as transport secretary. Put simply, nobody in our business trusts the man or has any confidence in him. Yousaf\u0027s decision to overturn the injustice done to transport police staff is an indication of Matheson\u0026rsquos lack of judgement. And frankly, Matheson should be made to resign for his incompetence. It\u0027s inconceivable that he can carry on in the transport brief.  Cortes added: \u0026ldquoWhilst I welcome the Joint Programme Board\u0027s latest thinking, make no mistake, this is also an embarrassing climbdown for the SNP. If they want us to believe they have integrity when it comes to security and transport policy then they don\u0027t just need to sink this dangerous and mindless merger proposal, they need to sack Matheson who has no right to expect trust to be vested in him again.  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: \u0026ldquoWhen alternative, less risky options were put forward the Scottish Government dismissed them in a high-handed fashion, choosing instead to barrel ahead with the abolition of the BTP in Scotland without even bothering to develop a proper business case.  \u0026ldquoThat decision cost millions of pounds, shredded the confidence of staff and took us back to square one. It\u0026rsquos no wonder that officer\u0027s representatives have been so critical of ministers\u0027 handling .  \u0026ldquoFor BTP officers and staff the future remains uncertain. The new justice secretary needs to junk the original plan altogether, given two years of work has shown it to be unworkable, and squarely focus on the other viable options for the future of this service.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAs the Justice Secretary highlighted to the Justice Committee recently, there is a need to identy interim arrangements that could give effect quickly to the devolution of railway policing, as recommended by the Smith Commission.  \u0026ldquoIn August, the Justice Secretary committed to re-examining all options with Police Scotland, the Scottish Police Authority, the British Transport Police and other partners. This process is currently underway and is being discussed by the Joint Programme Board. An update on the next steps will be provided in due course.    TIMELINE OF AN ATTEMPTED MERGER  Smith Commission published its report on further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament and railway policing was one of those areas.  British Transport Police sets out three options for future devolution of transport policing in Scotland. The third option \u0026ndash breaking up BTP and amalgamating Scottish operations into Police Scotland \u0026ndash is described as the \u0026ldquomost complex. This option would have implications for employment and pension arrangements, as well as financial and legal liabilities.  Scotland Act 2016 is given royal assent, which passed the recommendations of the Smith Commission into law.  The Scottish Government launched a consultation on option three, the integration of railway policing.  Consultation responses are published, showing \u0026ldquomuch opposition to the policy. \u0026ldquoMany considered that a strong case for integration had not been made, said the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos executive summary.  A survey of TSSA members found a third would leave BTP in the event of a merger.  The Railway Policing  Act was passed and TSSA launched a petition opposing the merger, which attracted more than 11,000 supporters  The merger, which was due to be implemented in April 2019, was postponed by former justice minister Michael Matheson.  New justice minister Humza Yousaf announces a review which will explore further options.    THE 2015 AND 2018 OPTIONS    Option One  This option is the simplest route to achieve devolution \u0026ndash that is, through administrative means, rather than legislation.  Option Two  This option consists of a number of measures, both legislative and administrative, to devolve transport policing within Scotland.  Option Three  This is the most complex route to devolution and it would entail breaking up BTP and absorbing its Scottish operations into Police Scotland.    Option 1  Establish a governance arrangement  through BTPA and SPA .  Option 2  Establish a model for SPA enhanced accountability and responsibility in the delivery of railway policing in Scotland .  Option 3  Proceed to full integration, with date to be informed by Police Scotland ."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-government-backs-greater-human-rights-checks-on-firms-after-dodgy-10bn-china-deal","story":"  Public bodies will also have to undertake stricter due diligence on potential commercial partners in the wake of the Government\u0026rsquos botched \u0026pound10bn investment agreement with a Chinese consortium.  In 2016, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon signed a \u0026ldquomemorandum of understanding with SinoFortone and China Railway No. 3 Engineering Group  at Bute House.  At the time, SinoFortone said the partnership could lead to \"signicant investment\" in areas including clean energy, transport and affordable housing in Scotland.  Ms Sturgeon did not publicise the agreement when it was struck and details only came to light after reports surfaced in the Chinese press.  It then emerged that CR3 parent company, China Railway Group , had been blacklisted by Norway\u0026rsquos oil fund following corruption allegations.  The ethics council of the Norwegian pension fund warned in 2014 there was a \"high degree of probability\" the firm \"paid bribes to government officials for contracts regarding construction of railways and housing projects\" in China.  The negative publicity was followed by the companies withdrawing from the memorandum and the proposal collapsed.  It was then revealed last year that the London-registered SinoFortune had failed to carry out many of the projects it had been linked to.  The report stated that the firm had not registered any company accounts and the only deal it had finalised was the purchase of a Buckinghamshire pub - the Plough Inn at Cadsden.  Sir Richard Heygate, who was SinoFortune\u0026rsquos UK agent, later described the firm as \u0026ldquoall bollocks. He added: \u0026ldquoIt shows how careless the first minister was to put pen to paper on a deal with Chinese companies she knew absolutely nothing about.\"  In June, the Government released its \u0026ldquoengagement strategy with China, but it also published a \u0026ldquoguidance document on due diligence and human rights for public bodies.  According to the recommendations, the Government and its quangos should assess whether a company, including a parent firm or subsidiary, has been linked to human rights abuses anywhere in the world. The checks would apply to where \u0026ldquodirect financial support is provided through grants, loans, financial investments and equity shares.  Non-financial support, such as when the Government acts as a broker between \u0026ldquotwo or more private sector partners, would also be put under the microscope.  Ministers have insisted the \u0026ldquoinitial checking should take place ahead of any meetings and more \u0026ldquosubstantive due diligence should occur as the relationship \u0026ldquodevelops and deepens.  The document also notes: \u0026ldquoCan the organisation or investor provide assurance on financial viability? Does it have any past record of financial wrongdoing, for example bribery or corruption?  Two months after the guidance was published, it was revealed that jobs quango Scottish Enterprise had given arms manufacturer Raytheon nearly \u0026pound200,000 between 2014 and 2017.

But with less than three weeks to go to the crunch October European Council, Mr Raab will use his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham to rule out any deal which \"locks in\" Britain to the EU by membership of a customs union or the European Economic Area.  He will also reject the European Commission\u0027s proposal for a \"backstop\" solution to the Irish border issue under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU customs area.  The Secretary of State will say: \"We are leaving the European Union in fact not just in name. If we can\u0027t obtain a deal that secures that objective... an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union...or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union, then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.\"  Restating his backing for Mrs May\u0027s Chequers Plan, Mr Raab will say: \"My approach to Brexit is pragmatic, not dogmatic. Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.  \"A deal that delivers on the referendum, because that\u0027s our democratic duty\u0026hellipthat manages the risks of Brexit, because that\u0027s our responsibility\u0026hellipthat grasps the opportunities of Brexit, because we\u0027re at our best when we\u0027re optimistic about the future.  \"And a deal that protects our precious Union, because we are the Conservative and Unionist Party,\" he will declare.  Mr Raab\u0026rsquos words follow remarks from Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, who hit out at the EU for \"taunting\" the UK since its rejection of the Chequers Plan at the Salzburg summit.  The first day of conference was dominated by the party\u0026rsquos Brexit psychodrama with Theresa May and her colleagues defending her compromise proposals against Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos attack in which he branded them \u0026ldquoderanged.  The Prime Minister insisted her beleaguered Chequers Plan was not dead as she refused to rule out making any more compromises to secure a deal.  She sought to reject Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos suggestion that, as a true believer in Brexit, his \u0026ldquosuper-Canada trade deal plan was better placed to succeed than her blueprint, by declaring: \u0026ldquoI believe in Brexit.  Mrs May also did not deny that a no-deal scenario would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, simply stating repeatedly that the UK Government was \"committed\" to ensuring that a hard border would not happen.  Ruth Davidson came to the PM\u0026rsquos defence, suggesting Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos harsh putdown of her Brexit compromise was \u0026ldquonot wise and called for Tory colleagues to observe a \u0026ldquoperiod of silence to give Mrs May the space to secure a deal.  Today in her address to conference, the Scottish Conservative leader will strike out again at the former Foreign Secretary and his fellow Brexiteers by extolling the Conservative virtues of pragmatism and practicality and decrying the \u0026ldquoivory-towered schemes of the ideological puritan.  She will tell conference: \u0026ldquoHere\u0026rsquos the truth: we can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn. I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.  Last night, Mrs May failed to turn up at the Scottish Conservative reception or indeed any other reception in a bid, said party sources, to \"save her voice\" and avoid a repeat of last year\u0026rsquos embarrassing episode when she lost it repeatedly during her end-of-conference speech. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, filled in for the PM at the Scots event.  Earlier, the PM unveiled a plan for a Festival of Brexit Britain to celebrate our \u0026ldquoprecious Union planned for 2022.

Judges were drawn from the meat industry experts and enthusiastic sausage aficionados.Paul Boyle, President of the Scottish Craft Butchers said: “All butchers think we make the best products but it is not until you pitch them against others that you find out just how good they really are. “To win awards in this evaluation is a great honour for the recipients because the standards are high and by highlighting the best available this serves as an important signpost for sausage lovers on the quest for the best.                                                                                                         “I know how important sausages are to customers and I hope that all recipients of awards attract new and repeat business.”Jill Bartlett of The Dalesman Group added: “Speciality sausages are undoubtedly a key driver in the revival of the great British Banger.“Families are seeking artisan gourmet ingredients as well as healthier options including low fat and leaner proteins from their local craft butchers.“Dalesman continues to deliver inspiration through its innovative speciality culinary and al speciality sausage mixes to the artisan butcher.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"udny chef set for vietnam culinary event","story":"        The Kilted Chef will take the flavours of his homeland to Hanoi next week when he takes part in a festival of food and drink, featuring Michelin star chefs from across the world.

Other areas of strength include the University’s role in supporting the local and national economy through its energy-related teaching and research activities, recently demonstrated by the creation of a National Decommissioning Centre.The Guide has also taken into account Aberdeen’s activities in areas of importance including widening access, investment in facilities, student welfare, and internationalisation – the University opened its first overseas campus in Qatar last year.Professor George Boyne, Principal, said: “This is a major honour and a testament to the efforts of our staff and students, as well as the great sense of identity and community that we have at Aberdeen.“As an institution we consistently attract students with exceptional ability and potential, and this - along with the quality of our teaching - has been an important factor in our success in areas such as degree outcomes and graduate employability.                                                                                                         “In addition, our strength in research - exemplied by the Queens Anniversary Prize for our contribution to health services research - places us at the forefront of innovation in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.“This University was founded in 1495 with the purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others, and this continues to inspire our academic achievements.“Our focus on widening access and inclusivity, strength in interdisciplinary teaching and research, and international outlook are the modern-day interpretation of our founding principles, which have played a major role in Aberdeen being named Scottish University of the Year.“I’d like to congratulate everyone at the University who has worked so hard to help us achieve this honour.”                                                                                                        Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Good University Guide, said: \"Aberdeen\u0027s sharp rise up our league table this year is the biggest of any university in the top 30 and gives it a ranking commensurate to its status as one of the UK\u0027s leading academic institutions.\"It was a clear winner of our Scottish University of the Year award and earned a shortlisting for the UK University of the Year title off the back of improved performances in most of the metrics used in our tables.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Monday 1 Oct 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Monday 1 Oct 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October 1, 2018 at 11:00 amTwo men have been charged in connection with the recovery of a quantity of heroin in the Finstown area.

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Monday 1 Oct 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotMonday 1 Oct 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgMonday 1 Oct 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would close  the new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed store\u0026rsquos grounds \u0026ndash another 6000 sq ft building and one covering 2500 sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for 79 cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the future  the site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: \u0026ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shop\u0026rsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move \u0026ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community council\u0026rsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new \u0026pound4million care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community council\u0026rsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: \u0026ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Street  allowed. The care home  has set a precedent so can\u0026rsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: \u0026ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care home\u0026rsquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning.

Also scheduled is a revamp of the heating system to make it more economic and efficient and modernisation of the toilets.Additional space for rental is also part of the plans. A spokeswoman for the group said: \u0026ldquoWe anticipate that these refurbishments should enable a much better experience for the many users of the village hall and also encourage greater use of the facility.A budget of around \u0026pound250,000 has been set aside for the work which has been primarily raised from three sources \u0026mdash the Highland Council, SSE\u0026rsquos energy efficiency fund and Fairburn wind farm fund and the Highland Cross.The spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoThe Muir of Ord Hall and Facilities Company is very grateful for these contributions and some local donations, without which we would not have been able to proceed.The Muir of Ord Village Hall on Seaforth Road has been a community hub for the village since 1893.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in 2016-17 by \u0026pound31.1 million. As of last weekend, it was valued at \u0026pound2,013,164,722.61.Addressing colleagues on the audit and scrutiny committee, Cllr MacLean called for a review of investment strategy. She acknowledged the need to secure the best .But she added: \u0026ldquoSome people are not happy with some of the investments and feel that perhaps  it\u0026rsquos invested in tobacco or arms or things like that, it\u0026rsquos not ethically responsible.She asked whether fund trustees had any say in the choice of investments.The council\u0026rsquos investments change on a daily basis.Recent examples of contentious choices include British American Tobacco , liqueurs firm Pernod Ricard , pubs chain Mitchells and Butlers , Japan Tobacco  and China\u0026rsquos second largest brewery, Tsingtao .The council\u0026rsquos finance director Derek Yule explained that an investments sub-committee reports to a pension board which sets the strategy.\u0026ldquoIt is very dficult when some of the investment strategy seeks to invest in shares in companies not just in the UK but worldwide, he said.\u0026ldquoWhilst I totally understand some of the ethical debate, it is very dficult to draw a line sometimes.\u0026ldquoYou might take a view\u0026hellip would you invest in banks, for example? They might not be the best investment, anyway. But I use that as an example because banks will fund these companies.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a dficult balancing act but it\u0026rsquos certainly within your rights  you wished the pension board to look at the investment strategy.\u0026ldquoFund managers are given guidelines to work to, so that would be quite legitimate for the council to do through the pension board.According to current policy, the fund \u0026ldquorecognises that social, environmental and ethical considerations are among factors investment managers will take into account, where relevant, when selecting investments for purchase, retention or sale.However, it stresses that \u0026ldquothe overriding consideration for pension committee members is their fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and scheme members.The Scheme Advisory Board, established up by the Scottish Government to regulate such public sector pension funds, recently obtained advice from legal counsel on the duty of pensions committees.The guidance concluded that: \u0026ldquoPensions committees in Scotland owe a fiduciary duty to the scheme employers and the scheme members in general and specically in relation to investment matters.\u0026ldquoThose duties should be exercised in the best interests of the beneficiaries and in relation to investment decisions, should aim to achieve the best financial position for the fund, balancing risk and  in the usual way.Monday 1 Oct 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The creation of a specic Scottish Government ministerial portfolio focussed on international trade, reflecting both the current environment and the government\u0026#8217s priorities, has been widely welcomed.                 Whatever happens with Brexit, Scotland needs to accelerate its focus on increasing exports and attracting inward investment. Those deals are critical to our future prosperity. Building innovative businesses is key to that success.            I join a strong team of ministers in the new finance and economy portfolio. Our focus is to ensure that Scotland’s economy, and our inclusive growth agenda, is centre stage across government. Our immediate priority is to engage with businesses – listening to their challenges and understanding how government can provide effective support.             Over the summer, I met dozens of businesses across many sectors and from all parts of Scotland, including highly innovative le sciences start-ups in Dundee, successful exporters in food and textiles in the Highlands  and rapidly-growing manufacturing businesses in Fe. This article appeared in Deals 2018. A digital version can be found here. I’ve witnessed the great work our universities do to attract inward investment and to support innovation, including through our eight sector-focussed innovation centres. I’ve seen how the Scottish Government’s £48 million investment in our new National Manufacturing Institute for Scotland is being applied, building on the success of our Advanced Forming Research Centre and putting Scotland at the forefront of Industry 4.0.It’s satisfying to know that my experience of building exporting businesses before coming into politics is being put to good use.Scotland’s track record on trade is solid – the latest information reporting a 53 per cent increase in international exports over ten years. Scotland’s 2,350 foreign-owned companies are a major contributor to our economy, delivering a combined turnover of £86 billion and employing more than 300,000 staff. And we remain competitive in attracting foreign direct investment .            The 2018 Ernst \u0026amp Young Attractiveness Survey reported a 7 per cent annual increase in new FDI projects in Scotland and the highest number of jobs created for a decade. We have consolidated our position as the UK’s most popular inward investment location outside of London, and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen all feature in the top-tenUK cities for attracting FDI. The quality of that FDI is also noteworthy – Scotland secured 24 per cent of all UK research and development projects in 2017 and digital projects grew by 56 per cent to become the second-largest sector behind business services.Scottish Development International is extremely effective in attracting international companies and high-value projects to Scotland, and in anchoring investors for the long term. I’ve visited the Scottish Government’s innovation and investment hub in Dublin which – along with our hubs in Paris, Berlin, Brussels and London – is on the front line of our export and inward investment drive. The Scottish Government has increased its investment in the economy this year by 64 per cent, as part of a £2.4bn investment in enterprise and skills. We have the most competitive business rates system in the UK and provide sectoral and business growth support through our enterprise agencies. The consolidation and expansion of government support for business investment through the new Scottish National Investment Bank further demonstrates our determination to put our money where our mouth is.             We have strong foundations to build upon, but there is still much work to do.Scotland has huge economic potential across many sectors where we can boast truly world-class capabilities and we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that emerge.Our ‘Scotland is Now’, campaign, launched in April and putting Scotland in the international spotlight, showcases our world-leading assets to a global audience. It harnesses the collective efforts of Scottish Government, VisitScotland, Scottish Development International and Universities Scotland to promote the country under a single, unied national brand.  ‘Scotland is Now’ is designed to put the country at the top of everyone’s list of places to live, work, study, invest and visit – a destination of choice for tourism and a vehicle for showing that our exports, such as food and drink, oil and gas, manufacturing and financial services, are of the highest calibre. In many ways, Scotland is an optimally sized country, with an accessible, agile government able to bring together key players and decision makers in order to respond to challenges and seize opportunities. We have seen this deployed to good effect to safeguard and create jobs in steel, shipbuilding and aluminium smelting in recent years. This close co-operation between government and business is something we intend to build on.            Scotland’s public finances continue to improve and our economy is growing twice as fast as the UK as a whole. These trends – along with recent labour market, productivity and GDP data – show we are on the right track. And we will continue to use our devolved powers to best effect, which the forthcoming Export Action Plan I intend to bring forward will demonstrate. However, actions on population growth, participation in the labour market and productivity are also essential and require Westminster to play its part too, or to give the Scottish Parliament the tools to deliver them. This is a government committed to growing the economy in a sustainable and inclusive way. Scotland has huge economic potential and the Scottish Government is determined to work alongside business to unlock it.Ivan McKee is minister for trade, investment and innovation.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807526.1538381287!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch scotland s modern day clearances under way","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Duke of Buccleuch may be legally within his rights but sale plans to clear land for forestry are morally flawed, writes Lesley Riddoch.                Is Scotland’s biggest landowner victimising the tenant farmer who accused him of clearing people to make way for trees?            Last week, the Duke of Buccleuch put a portfolio of land on the market called Evertown, which includes farms, productive farmland, commercial forestry and planting opportunities near Canonbie in Dumfries and Galloway. The 9,000 acres is composed of 18 lots on sale for £19.5 million – most hill ground is priced at three times its agricultural value and advertised as “suitable for forestry planting”.            : Video: Who are Scotland’s biggest landowners?It includes Alison and David Telfer’s tenanted farm near the Dumfriesshire village of Langholm, despite earlier promises that the duke would reflect on local anger about removing tenants to secure lucrative forestry planting grants. Local MSP Joan McAlpine has been working behind the scenes on this case and says: “The duke and his factors are unflinchingly cruel in the case of the Telfers. He could easily allow them to see out their working lives at the farm – instead he has split their farm into two lots for sale, removing part of it imminently. The Telfers believe they are being victimised by a powerful and vindictive organisation, and I am inclined to agree.”• : Duke of Buccleuch to sell off thousands of acres of land in BordersThe higher ground of the Telfer’s farm, Cleuchfoot, is being sold for planting under the locally unfamiliar name of “Tansy Hill” combined with a small block of forestry five miles distant. The farmhouse and lower ground are up for sale in a separate lot, though the Telfers have been allowed to stay till next November.            Ms McAlpine said: “Alison and David say breaking up the farm disguises the fact it’s their ground being cleared and sold for tree planting. Cleuchfoot is synonymous with their fight, Tansy Hill means nothing. They think this is deliberate and misleading.”The Telfers say the Buccleuch estate intends to value their sheep for sale on 10 October and will remove the animals soon after. It’s unclear whether Forestry Scotland has approved tree planting. Government ministers have said forestry grants shouldn’t be misused and the duke may know he will be refused permission for mass planting on tenanted farms because of the public outcry when news of terminated leases broke earlier this year.Joan McAlpine said: “Potential purchasers need to be made aware of the situation. The duke could easily allow Alison and David to retire in five years and then sell the land, as promised. It would not hurt His Grace at all. But being forced out is definitely hurting Alison and David.”Of course, the Buccleuch Estate contests this account.            A spokesman refuted the suggestion that the Telfers are being “cleared off their land” as “a complete distortion of the facts” and described Ms McAlpine’s comments as “ inaccurate and inflammatory.” The estate maintains this is not an eviction, but simply the ending of a lease. They say the Telfers have always known of the estate’s long-term plans and the idea they’re being removed for tree planting is “utterly wrong.” They say the Telfers have been given extensions beyond their removal date and the chance to buy the farmhouse and surrounding ground. But how would two people on a frugal income, approaching retirement with no assets find an asking price of £600k? Furthermore, the Telfers have been farming at Cleuchfoot for almost 20 years on a succession of insecure tenancy agreements. Why have these been the only option available? And  the estate has no plan to plant trees, why the urgent need to remove them? Of course Scotland’s Tenant Farming Commissioner, Bob McIntosh, did investigate earlier complaints of bullying and found the duke’s estate acted in compliance with the law.Buccleuch have said the current land sale will honour existing leasing agreements and tenant farmers with secure, long-term tenancies have the chance to buy their farms. It’s believed none have been completed yet though – in part because of restrictive sale conditions.Scottish Land Commission chair Andrew Thin says “We will review the actions Buccleuch now takes with care, and stand ready to offer advice where required.” But he welcomes the move to ersy land ownership. So do farming organisations. So do I.            I’d welcome it a lot more  local farmers were guaranteed a fair chance of becoming future owners. But the question remains.Is it morally acceptable for landowners to get Forestry Commission Scotland grants for planting trees on land where tenant farmers have been cleared and evicted? If not, then the law must change and removals must stop.The practice of shipping people off the land for fracking, tree-planting and wind farms is no more acceptable today than evicting tens of thousands for sheep farming and deer hunting in the Highlands or agricultural and industrial uses in the Lowlands. As Tom Devine’s new book The Scottish Clearances makes graphically clear, eviction and removal of insecure tenants by the landed classes has been a Scotland-wide way of le for centuries. Recent removals of tenant farmers Andrew Stoddart from Haddington and the Paterson family from Arran show that grim way of le continues. It shames Scotland.So who will protect the Telfers?Forestry Commission Scotland  say: “The current forestry grant scheme guidance states applicants must have control of the land and a legal right to plant trees.  We want to be confident that where control has recently changed, or land has come out of farming, any actions taken to end a tenancy or farming partnership by the previous or new owner have been entirely legal.”But these moves are always entirely legal. The question is – are they moral and is the law an ass?FCS may be shamed into declining grant applications from new and existing owners of contested, cleared land.  But that won’t help the Telfers, the campaign to reforest Scotland, the empowerment of local people on quasi-feudal sporting estates or public faith in our land lawsNo new land reform bill is planned for this parliament. Yet we desperately need a way to protect all tenant farmers and ersy large landholdings. Progress is painfully slow and public support for a land tax system is growing.None of this will be formally discussed at the SNP conference. But where does rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing stand? I’m sure the land reform supporting public and the Telfers would love to know.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4807555.1538375591!/image/image.jpg","title":"tories ready to walk away from brexit deal over eu demands","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The UK will walk away from Brexit talks  the EU pushes too hard for concessions on Theresa May\u0026#8217s plans, Dominic Raab is set to warn in the toughest rhetoric towards Brussels yet.                The Brexit Secretary will today tell the Conservative conference in Birmingham that “our willingness to compromise is not without limits”, and warns that “we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal”  the EU’s position threatens the integrity of the Union.            Yesterday the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also struck a defiant tone towards Brussels, claiming the UK will not be the only “prisoner” wanting to leave the EU  it is turned into a jail.            Mr Hunt warned EU negotiators to “never ever mistake British politeness for British weakness” and likened their desire to “punish” the UK to the Soviet Union.The tough talk comes after the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham descended into fresh infighting over Brexit, with senior Conservatives hitting back at Boris Johnson for calling the Prime Minister’s strategy “deranged”. The former foreign secretary crashed through the first day of the Tory conference in Birmingham, saying the Chequers plan was “entirely preposterous” and suggesting that Theresa May wasn’t committed to delivering Brexit.• : Theresa May warned she faces ‘polite rebellion’ over BrexitIt brought a sharp response from Brexiteers and Remainers, with the former Brexit secretary David Davis mocking Mr Johnson’s plans for a bridge linking Britain and Ireland, and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson calling for a “period of silence”.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Johnson said: “Unlike the Prime Minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”            Last night at a pro-Brexit fringe meeting, Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson called Chequers an “unmitigated disaster that has humiliated us at home and in the EU, and is breaking this party apart”. The isions will continue today with a fringe meeting attended by two former ministers calling for a second EU referendum on the terms of the UK’s Brexit deal.Mrs May insisted she was acting in “the national interest” by pushing ahead with a plan to keep the UK aligned with the EU in trade of goods, in a bid to maintain the status quo along the Irish border and limit the damage to the economy.The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: “I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future.”She said the onus was on the EU to come forward with detailed explanations of its concerns, along with counter-proposals for discussion. “Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland,” the Prime Minister told Marr.            “Where they have problems, let’s actually hear them and it’s only then that you can actually identy what the issue really is, where there are issues that lie behind this.“My mood is to listen to what the EU have to say about their concerns and to sit down and talk them through with them.”Ms Davidson questioned why the former foreign secretary was against a plan for the Irish border that was signed off by the full cabinet in December.“There’s been time over the last two years for debate,” she told the BBC’s Sunday Politics Scotland programme.“The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed – and praised it as soon ago as last year.            “In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one.”Addressing the conference today, Ms Davidson will appeal for unity and call for party members to “go back to our Conservative principles” and reject Brexit dogma.“We can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives, or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn,” Ms Davidson will say. “I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.”In his speech in Birmingham, Mr Raab will describe his approach to Brexit as “pragmatic, not dogmatic”.“Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.“But our willingness to compromise is not without limits. We are leaving the European Union in fact, not just in name. If we can’t obtain a deal that secures that objective…  an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union… or  the only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union. Then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.”Former Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who quit Mrs May’s Cabinet along with Mr Johnson in protest at the Chequers plan, was dismissive of a series of policy suggestions from the pretender to the Tory leadership. “I think one of the blights of British politics is politicians having fantastic ideas that cost a fortune and don’t do much good,” Mr Davis told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday.“Quite a lot of his ideas, I think, are good headlines but not necessarily good policies.”Mr Davis confirmed he would vote against Chequers  it came before the House of Commons in its current form, but rejected Labour suggestions that defeat for Mrs May at the hands of Tory rebels would collapse the Government.“I will vote against Chequers, full stop, and it won’t lead to a general election,” he said.“We are capable of managing this through.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046476.jpg--.jpg?1537863861000\n","title":"par ful good effort for dementia charity","story":"  \nBallymena Golf Club did par-ful well by raising \u0026pound5,130.00 at a Charity Golf Day event for Dementia NI.\n  \nThe even saw approximately 136 golfers in 34 teams take to the greens on a superb sunny day .\n  \n The overall ladies winner was Elaine Mark and the overall men’s winner was John Devlin.\n  \nBallymena Golf Club members Noel Gourley and partner Evelyn Allen gave their support leading up to and during the event, securing sponsorship, taking photographs and running a raffle at the evening prize-giving.\n  \nFionnuala Savage Income Generation Manager Dementia NI said:\n  \n“Thank you so much to everyone who supported the Ballymena Golf Club charity day and raised \u0026pound5,130.00 for support local people living with dementia. \n  \nToday, it is estimated that there are currently 20,000 people across Northern Ireland living with dementia.

She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!\n  \n“Some people put our Facebook link \u0027Ballymena Rocks\u0027 on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.\n  \nThe more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!\n  \nThere certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.\n  \nDoreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.\n  \nIn Ballymena the most likely places to find a \u0027rock\u0027 is at the People\u0027s Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.\n  \nDon\u0027t forget to upload a picture of a rock  you find one.\n  \nDoreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.\n  \nC\u0027mon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while you\u0027re doing it!\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1054808.jpg--.jpg?1538146635000\n","title":"population aged 85 and over continues to rise","story":"  \nTHE NUMBER of people aged 85 and over has risen again in the last year.\n  \nBy June 2017 the population aged 85 and over living in Northern Ireland was estimated to be 37,200. \n  \nThis is a 2%, or 700 person, increase on the mid-2016 estimate.\n  \nThis is one of the findings of statistics published by the Northern Ireland Statistics \u0026amp Research Agency .\n  \nCo-Ordinator of Good Morning Ballymena, Debbie Chestnut, said she has noticed an increase in people getting in touch with them and unfortunately has had to turn people away.\n  \nIt is really dficult that we can\u0027t help every elderly person that gets in touch with us but we just don\u0027t have enough volunteers, Debbie explained.\n  \nGood Morning Ballymena provides a vital service for older people in the town and are in desperate need of volunteers.\n  \nDebbie added: Some people can\u0027t get out of their house so  we are able to call them on the phone or go and visit them then this makes all the dference.\n  \nLonliness is the biggest killer in this age group of people and it is vitally important that they aren\u0027t forgotten.\n  \nOver the last decade  the population aged 85 and over has increased by 9,200 people or 33%.\n  \nThis population, sometimes referred to as the oldest old, has grown over five times faster than the rest of the population.\n  \nThis faster growth is being driven by historical improvements in longevity.\n  \nIn 2017, Northern Ireland’s oldest old made up 2% of our population. \n  \nThis is the lowest percentage of the four United Kingdom countries. \n  \nHowever, the growth rate over the last decade in Northern Ireland  was signicantly higher than in Great Britain .\n  \nWhile last year women accounted for two thirds  of the population aged 85 and over, the proportion of men in this age group continues to rise.\n  \nThe statistics indicate that there were 274 centenarians  living in Northern Ireland. \n  \nThis is equivalent to one centenarian for every 10,000 people living in Northern Ireland.\n  \nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n  \n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n  \n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n  \n\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650056.1538064776!/image/image.jpg","title":"banbidge gallery marks a decade of artistic triumph","story":"\nF.E.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott. The gallery’s award-winning sculpture garden provides the perfect setting for these stunning works in bronze, stone, steel and glass.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"\nA spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.\n\n                \nThe church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Church\u0027s Harvest service\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. \n\n“There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nMinister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.\n\n“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOf the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.\n\n“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”\n\nThe Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October 7 at 11.30am and 7pm.\n\nRev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from 3pm to 6pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”\n\n

Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He\u0027s always tinkered and restored cars and I wanted to help him. I guess this was my apprenticeship,\" said the 26-year-old nurse from Middletown.\n\nMandy and her dad spent weekend after weekend lovingly restoring the car over the past four years.\n\n\"We just started it as a weekend project. We both work full-time, so it was a hobby for both of us,\" she said.\n\n\"My dad has always tinkered with cars but we took on quite a lot with this one. However, looking at it now, there\u0027s no way I\u0027d ever part with it. It has a lot of sentimental value.\"\n\nThe Cortina caused quite a stir as Mandy, husband Justin Gormley, Robert and mum Jessica made their way through the Continent on the 3,350-mile road trip. \n\nThe family spent a lot of their spare time posing for photographs. \n\nThe Cortina was even commandeered for a photoshoot by a model agency in Paris.\n\n\"The whole experience made us feel pretty cool,\" added Mandy.\n\n\"Once the Cortina got through the MoT in June we decided we\u0027d go for it. We turned it into our family holiday, though we had to load the boot up with a lot of spare parts just in case, as we weren\u0027t really sure  our work on the car would last the pace.\n\n\"We thought about driving straight to Cortina and back again, but it was too good an opportunity to waste, so we planned the trip to take in a lot of the sights all of us wanted to see around Europe. It all went so well and we might plan another one.\"\n\nApart from the UK, the car passed through the Republic, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Monaco.\n\n\"We\u0027ve been through the Black Forest, driven across the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the highest bridge in the world, and around the famous Stelvio Pass in the north of Italy with its 49 hairpin bends,\" said Mandy.\n\n\"When we arrived in Cortina D\u0027Ampezzo in Italy the locals were amazed to see the car. \n\n\"There are not that many of them still around, and even fewer managed to make it back to the town they were named after.\"\n\nBack in 1964 a new Ford Cortina would have completed around 32 miles to the gallon, but Mandy said she wanted to make the car as economical as possible.\n\n\"You could say I had a trip like this in the back of my mind when we put a diesel engine in it, and in the end we were getting up to 62mpg, so that was well worth it considering how far we\u0027ve managed to travel in it.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"chaotic scenes at belfast international airport as travellers report long delays","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And last Monday the airport blamed equipment failure for long delays though its security.\n\nMichael Smyth - a union official for Nautlilus International which represents ferry workers - arrived early at the airport for his flight to Liverpool for his organisation\u0027s annual conference. \n\nHe is a regular flyer visiting many of the UK\u0027s ious ports. He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\n\n\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said. \n\n\"I just couldn\u0027t understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\n\n\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"\n\nHe added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a 40 minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters. \n\n\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\n\n\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"\n\nThe airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November 1.\n\nBelfast International Airport was asked for comment.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"documentary claims to have identified suspected ira pub bombers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has labelled the behaviour of Lord Melchett as \u0026ldquodisgraceful and called for immediate action.\n\nThe furore centres around a five year-old girl whose father wants her to attend a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan. However, because she lives in the country outside Castlewellan she would need to have school minibus transport provided for her.\n\nAccording to Mrs Smyth, she has been told by the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the child will have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe child\u0026rsquos father wants her to go to a controlled school and he is entitled to have her do so, Mrs Smyth said. \u0026ldquoI am thoroughly disgusted and I think that the Department of Education must be totally inefficient  they don\u0026rsquot answer within a month.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash There just seems to be no stopping the Downpatrick supergroup Rosetta Stone, who recently completed another dynamic tour of Japan and will be setting off on a trip to Thailand later this year.\n\nThe five members of the group \u0026mdash Damien, Terry and Colin McKee, Andy LeGear and Ian Mitchell \u0026mdash are just back from their second conquering trip to Japan where their latest hit, Sheila, is currently number one.\n\nIn the last year the band have been playing constantly across the globe and have built up a huge following in many countries, including Germany and Canada. But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working. When he arrived back at the vehicle an ignition key and a boot key had ben taken.\n\nPolice in Strangford have since been informed that a children\u0026rsquos sponsored walk was passing through the area at the time and they have appealed to parents to ask the children who took part  they know anything about the theft.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash A burning interest in art has led Newcastle couple Margaret and Gerry Grant into an unusual project \u0026mdash the opening of a new art gallery in their own home.\n\nWith over 200 paintings and sculptures of their own they have opened the gallery in an extension to their Bryansford Road house.\n\nBut it isn\u0026rsquot only for the fun of it. The Grants will be buying and selling works and promoting exhibitions. Already they have lined up an autumn show with exhibits from a Spanish painter and an Italian sculptor.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are aiming at the professional rather than the amateur, Mrs Grant said. \u0026ldquoOur main aim is to share our interest in art, but we do see the commercial and promotional sides to it.\n\n\u0026ldquoReally there is a wide range of work on show. My husband and I have been interested in art for a long time.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash A phantom clothes line thief has struck again \u0026mdash this time in Dundrum. The thief, who has been confining his acts to the Newcastle and Dundrum area, struck during the night at a house on the Dromara Road.\n\nA considerable number of children\u0026rsquos clothes were taken from the line, making it a profitable night for the thief.\n\nPolice in Dundrum and Newcastle are anxious to catch the thief, who must have a considerable wardrobe stocked up by now. Anyone with information or who sees anyone acting suspiciously around houses at night should contact them immediately.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash Plans for a new primary school in Killinchy have brought a \u0026rsquono go\u0026rsquo sign from local residents. In a petition to the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the residents of Ardview Park have expressed serious concern about the plans.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos not the building of the school they object to, but rather the fact that access to the site will be off Ardview Park. They say they are concerned about traffic which will be using the road, both during the construction of the school and when it is opened.\n\nTheir petition was recently shown to members of the Board\u0026rsquos Finance Committee. Afterwards it was agreed to set up a special sub-committee to visit the school and report back on the plans.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash A Ballygowan housewe will be one of eight ladies who will be taking part in the national finals of the Cook of the Realm contest.

The top prize is valued at more than \u0026pound4,000.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Ardglass boxer Ray Ross has been offered a wonderful chance to make an impact on the British lightweight scene.\n\nEvery since he lost a close decision to Charlie Nash for the Irish title two years ago, the 28 year-old slugger has shown indferent form. But now the Ardglass golf course greenskeeper has a chance to make the top before he runs out of fight time and interest.\n\nRoss has been matched with the experienced Jonnie Elliott, of Bournemouth, over eight rounds at Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast on October 11 and a win would hoist Ross up the lightweight ladder and on to bigger punch for paydays.\n\nRay is part of a big British title fight night involving Antrim southpaw Jim Montague against Clinton McKenzie for the vacant light welterweight title.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Kilclief in full flow as ‘Fin are bottled up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA RESILIENT Kilclief outfit produced a rousing second half display to shatter Aughlisnafin\u0026rsquos championship dreams at St Colman\u0026rsquos Park, Drumaness, on Saturday.\n\nDespite going into the break only 0-6 to 0-4 down, Kilclief were staring down the barrel of an ignoble defeat after losing the influential Louis McMullan and James McGrath to early black cards.\n\nTo make matters even worse, they also lost the talismanic Ciaran Sloan to a hamstring injury and almost down to the bare bones, they looked vulnerable and there for the taking.\n\nHowever, led brilliantly by Aiden McCann and Eoin King they took the game to Aughlisnafin with a swagger and sparkle that Willie Megoran\u0026rsquos side were unable to contain.\n\nAughlisnafin were impressively out of the traps first.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.\n\nA Force 8 gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some 90 minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.\n\nOn arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasn\u0026rsquot.\n\nThe leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at 6pm, ing home one hour later.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.\n\nSome of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekend\u0026rsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellan\u0026rsquos Lower Square for generations.\n\nSlieve Croob councillor Ro\u0026iacutes\u0026iacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the town\u0026rsquos permanent Christmas tree.\n\n\u0026ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8715694.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

claim to have identied two prime suspects in the 1974 IRA Birmingham pub bombings.\n\n                \nThe explosions at the Tavern in the Town and Mulberry Bush killed 21 people and injured another 220.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOne of the men named in the ITV Exposure programme, to be broadcast on Monday night, is convicted IRA bomber James Francis Gavin, who has since died.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nGavin, a former British soldier, is alleged in the documentary, Hunt For The Birmingham Bombers, to have been one of the people who planted the bombs.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe second suspect is shown being asked about his alleged role by programme-makers outside a Belfast supermarket.\n\nHe declined to comment and his lawyers told the programme: \"Our client denies all the allegations ... and does not intend to respond any further to the unfounded allegations you have made.\"\n\nThe documentary will suggest that the Crown Prosecution Service previously examined the case against the new suspect and concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge him.\n\nA botched criminal investigation by West Midlands Police immediately after the atrocity led to the jailing of the Birmingham Six - one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in English legal history.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTheir convictions were quashed in 1991 after a long battle by campaigners, including MP and journalist Chris Mullin.\n\nNobody else has been brought to justice for the attacks.\n\nJulie Hambleton, whose 18-year-old sister Maxine was killed in the blasts, has for years led the Justice4the21 campaign and was interviewed for the programme.\n\nMs Hambleton said: \"What do I want? Me, personally, I want the bastards who killed my sister and the other 20 to be brought to justice, short and simple.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe added: \"We could have walked past him when we were in Belfast.\n\n\"When people ask you how\u0027d you feel  you met them or saw them, you can never answer that question.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled last week that a coroner had been right to exclude identying alleged perpetrators of the attacks in fresh inquests.\n\nThe documentary will be
