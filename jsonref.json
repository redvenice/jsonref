I was searching on Christian Mingle and s**t and I seen her profile pop up and I’m like, “This b***h is fire.”‘So I slid in her Christian Mingle messages and s**t and she responded to my email so then we had linked up and s**t… I don’t wear a condom!Blac Chyna ‘loses deal with stroller company’ as she \u0027uses one as weapon\u0027 in scuffleWe mean, these quotes are really something, but anything could happen in this Kardashian-offshoot universe. contacted reps for comment."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9813133.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"elizabeth olsen isnt happy boobs show avengers costume","story":"Elizabeth has just one want for her costume (picture: Marvel, Backgrid)Elizabeth Olsen has opened up about her thoughts on her Avengers costume, as the latest offering Infinity War smashes the box office.And, sorry to say, like Shania Twain, it didn’t impress her much.You see, the actress – who plays the powerful Scarlett Witch in the newly-released MCU epic – felt a little miffed she was the only woman whose costume showed off her cleavage, throughout the various sagas.‘It would just not be a cleavage corset. I like corsets, but I’d like it to be higher,’ the 29-year-old said, when asked by Elle about what she’d change on her costume. ‘Everyone has these things that cover them – Tessa Thompson does, Scarlett does. I would like to cover up a bit.The character shows a touch of cleavage for some pretty epic scenes (picture: Marvel)‘It’s funny because sometimes I look around and I’m just like, “Wow, I’m the only one who has cleavage”. And that’s a constant joke because they haven’t really evolved my superhero costume that much.’We have to say, her costume is perhaps a little more conservative in Infinity War, as opposed to Age of Ultron, when she was rocking a full on, busty corset.Still, she praised the MCU for sticking to their ‘iconic’ vision for the cast’s costumes, that continued to draw inspiration from the OG comics that championed powerful women.‘But then you look at where it started in the comic books and it was a leotard and a headband so…oh, it’s horrible, it’s so horrible,’ she added. ‘So at least they know that’s not cool. But then they made Wonder Woman, you know? And that’s what she’s in.‘I think of the costumes and what we have to wear—it’s more about iconic images, because that’s what these movies are…. I think that’s the goal with the costumes, and it’s not representing the average woman.’The actress – and sister of the Olsen Twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley – revealed recently she’d like to ‘explore’ the back story of her character.Talking to Digital Spy, Elizabeth revealed her hopes for Scarlet’s relationship with The Vision to be explored in more depth and said she would like the comic book back story to be brought into the movie.How much did Avengers Infinity War cost to make?Where was Valkyrie in Avengers: Infinity War?

Her resignation letter said she ‘inadvertently misled’ parliament.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt will also take on Ms Rudd’s former responsibilities as Minister for Women and Equalities, Downing Street announced.It follows intense pressure for Ms Rudd to step down over the Windrush generation crisis, which saw people who came to the UK as citizens detained in immigration centres, denied healthcare and threatened with deportation.The Hastings and Rye MP became the fifth minister to leave the Cabinet since last year’s snap general election.Her resignation letter said she took ‘full responsibility’ for not being aware of the existence of targets.Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to see her successor as home secretary leave the post, while Ms Rudd’s opposite number Diane Abbott said she had ‘done the right thing’.James Brokenshire becomes the new Communities and Local Government Secretary (Picture: PA)The pressure had been building on the former banker ever since the emergence of the ‘appalling’ treatment of Caribbean immigrants to the UK between the 1940s and 1970s – the so-called Windrush generation.Concerns had been raised about the immigration status of the Windrush generation and there had been stories of people being forced to prove their annual presence in the country for decades in order to prove they were here legally.Ms Rudd referred to the Windrush ‘scandal’ in her two-page resignation letter, admitting that people with a right to live in the UK had not always been treated ‘fairly and and humanely’.Opposition parties said she was paying the price for Mrs May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy towards illegal immigrants when she was Home Secretary which had led to people being wrongly stripped of their rights and threatened with deportation.Sajid Javid, left, with Amber Rudd, centre right (Picture: Getty)Diane Abbott said: ‘This was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.‘The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.’Ms Rudd had appeared to be prepared to ride out the storm announcing her intention to come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ ‘legitimate questions’ about the removals targets.She had previously apologised in the House for the ‘appalling’ treatment of the Windrush veterans, announcing a taskforce to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.However, she was criticised for saying the Home Office was ‘too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’, prompting accusations that she was trying to put the blame on civil servants.Her resignation follow those of former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel as international development secretary, Damian Green as first minister and James Brokenshire, who left his role as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds since June last year.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Home Office workers, said: ‘The Windrush scandal has highlighted how inhumane immigration policies coupled with cuts to Home Office staff and increased workloads is a recipe for disaster.‘The resignation of Amber Rudd should be a wake-up call to the Government to end the hostile environment they have created for people wanting to come to this country and to put a stop to the blame culture where Home Office staff carry the can for the failings of ministers.’MORE: Diane Abbott gets so much racist abuse her aides update police every weekMORE: Flood alerts issued as month’s worth of rain due to be dumped on Britain today"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9816187.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"tories keep standing like","story":"Sajid Javid outside the Home Office today (Picture: Reuters)What impression do you get when you look at this photo?Is it an overwhelming sense of competence, authority and strength?Presumably that’s what Sajid Javid was going for when he struck this power pose outside the Home Office on his first day in the new job, staring into the middle distance to contemplate the full historic weight of his appointment.But some people noticed something else.He’s not the only Tory politician to stand like this.

The finished work features a black background splashed with red, pink, orange and whiteHowever crude, it’s joyful and there’s a strong, athletic abstract resemblance to a match – with the ball being shot from the background to the foreground.It almost looks to me like he’s used the ball as a paint brush. It’s very vibrant, very energetic, very different. He was probably covered in paint by the end. Is it a piece of performance art? I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow. Maybe Andy was getting some aggression out, maybe he wanted to burn off some energy. I think he was just having a bit of fun.

There had been reports of a \u0027negative presence\u0027 from people visiting their loved ones\u0027 graves\u0027When I watched back the footage and actually saw the spirit flying at me, it was really weird.\u0027It is a very strange experience but it is also great to have how you feel validated.

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas. It was accepted that there would be minor post-completion remedials which the purchaser accepted. The images recently reported in no way reflect the property on the day of occupation.’As for Mr Buller’s issues with his sewage plant, a satisfactory resolution looks some way away.A spokesperson for Linden Homes says that when the Bullers purchased their home it was in a ‘virtually finished state’ and that they had requested an early legal completion. She says the price they paid ‘reflects the overall amenity of the plot’.She adds that the manhole covers on the plot would have been ‘clearly visible’ at the time the property was reserved.She says: ‘Mr and Mrs Buller have complained of a “sewage odour” to the rear of their property. There are no foul sewers to the rear associated with the Heathlands development.‘There are however existing foul and surface water sewers, which are the subject of imminent upgrade works by Thames Water, following complaints of unpleasant smells from residents. We have offered to commission an air quality assessment to establish the source of any odours around the property.‘In the unlikely event that the survey indicates that odours from the pump station exceed acceptable levels, we will undertake any necessary works required.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B7E48E700000578-0-image-a-17_1524783490880.jpg","title":"TSB closed branches early weekend","story":"    TSB closed some of its branches early over the weekend and turned off the lights to avoid having to deal with irate customers, it has been claimedHalf of its customers were still locked out of their online accounts last night – ten days after the bank began an ill-fated systems upgrade. Many of the 1.9million customers affected have been unable to make bank transfer payments, meaning vital bills have gone unpaid.TSB’s problems stem from a failed switch-over from the IT system of its old owner Lloyds Banking Group to one owned by its Spanish parent company Sabadell.TSB chief says the bank\u0027s IT chaos is bringing company to...One million TSB customers are STILL locked out of their...Share this articleThe bank provoked more fury as branches closed early on Saturday – the first day many workers were able to visit a branch since problems started.Branches in Hull, Lincoln, Clifton in Nottingham, Greenock, Falkirk and Elgin in Scotland were reported to have shut early.TSB in Hull closed at 1pm on Saturday when it usually shuts at 4pm.The branch then directed customers to its nearest branches 46 miles away in Doncaster or Retford in Nottinghamshire, which is 65 miles away.

Pictured: Theresa May and Netanyahu meeting in London last yearBritain has never been \u0027naive\u0027 about Iran\u0027s nuclear programme, a spokesman for the government said tonight, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Islamic republic of lying to the world about its ambitions. The spokesman also said inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are vital to ensure Iran\u0027s nuclear programme is used for peaceful means. Netanyahu stepped up pressure on the United States to pull out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, holding a primetime address on Israeli TV to present what he called evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme.\u0027We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions. That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords,\u0027 a British government spokesman said in a statement.\u0027It remains a vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal and that Iran\u0027s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\u0027 Intelligence experts and diplomats said Netanyahu did not seem to have presented a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 showing that Iran had violated the agreement, although he may have helped make a case on behalf of hawks in the U.S. administration who want to scrap it.          In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027    The premier accused the Islamic Republic of \u0027brazenly lying\u0027 to the United States and Europe by maintaining nuclear materials in a secret location - a violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action          Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his intelligence services have obtained documents proving that Iran maintained a secret nuclear program in violation of a landmark agreement Tehran reached with the West. Netanyahu points to a slide which is purported to show \u0027massive safes\u0027 where Iran\u0027s \u0027secret archive\u0027 were storedMost of the purported evidence Netanyahu unveiled dated to the period before the 2015 accord was signed, although he said Iran had also kept important files on nuclear technology since then, and continued adding to its \u0027nuclear weapons knowledge\u0027.Tehran dismissed Netanyahu as \u0027the boy who cried wolf\u0027, and called his presentation propaganda.President Donald Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the international deal unless it is renegotiated by May 12. After Netanyahu spoke, Trump repeated his criticism of the deal, suggesting he backed the Israeli leader\u0027s remarks.\u0027Iran\u0027s leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,\u0027 Netanyahu said at Israel\u0027s Defence Ministry, standing in front of stacks of files representing what he described as a vault full of Iranian nuclear documents obtained weeks before.\u0027I will do whatever it takes to put this right\u0027: Sajid Javid...Trump says he\u0027s been \u0027100 per cent right\u0027 about Iran\u0027s...\u0027If we can\u0027t fix it, he\u0027s going to withdraw\u0027: Pompeo tells...Share this article\u0027Tonight I\u0027m here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.\u0027\u0027Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons programme,\u0027 he said. \u0027One hundred thousand secret files prove it did. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.\u0027Although the presentation was live on Israeli television, Netanyahu made clear that his audience was abroad: he delivered most of his speech in English, before switching to Hebrew.Netanyahu said he had shared the intelligence with the United States and would dispatch envoys to France and Germany to present it. He also spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Tehran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses its arch-foe Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it.          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesA senior European diplomat told Reuters: \u0027We knew all of this and what especially stands out is that Netanyahu doesn\u0027t speak of any recorded violations\u0027 of the deal itself.Speaking after Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, Trump told a White House news conference the nuclear deal was \u0027a horrible agreement for the United States\u0027. He said it would let Tehran develop nuclear arms after seven years and had \u0027proven right what Israel has done today\u0027 with Netanyahu\u0027s disclosures.However, Washington itself has concluded that Iran has not violated the deal\u0027s terms. Two U.S. intelligence officials who have monitored Iran\u0027s nuclear weapons program for years said nothing in Netanyahu\u0027s remarks appeared to contradict that view.\u0027We have seen no new and credible evidence that Iran is violating the agreement, whether in the Prime Minister\u0027s remarks today or from other sources,\u0027 said one of the officials, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.Moments before Netanyahu spoke Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: \u0027The boy who can\u0027t stop crying wolf is at it again\u0027.Abbas Araqchi, a senior Iranian foreign ministry official, was quoted by Iran\u0027s Tasnim news agency as calling Netanyahu\u0027s presentation \u0027a childish and ridiculous game\u0027 with the goal of influencing Trump\u0027s decision ahead of the May 12 deadline.Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, though it neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/22/4BB6BA3200000578-0-image-m-11_1525124277043.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS Meghan shouldnt mess winning formula rugged Prince Harry","story":"Harry, pictured left in 2016 and right last week, has a new slimline look for the royal weddingThird — I speak from personal experience — our hero possibly did not much enjoy the subtle tutting when the tailor took his measurements for the morning-coat. ‘Tsk-tsk, been at the biscuit barrel, sir?’For Harry, reared on nursery food and Army canteen grub, nutritional self-denial may not come easily.

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of having a secret plan called ‘Project Amad’, whose goal is to produce five ten-kiloton nuclear weapons.This unverified claim will of course have been music to the ears of Donald Trump and the anti-Iran hawks the President has surrounded himself with in the White House.Even before this dramatically theatrical display from Israel, Mr Trump appeared determined to scrap the controversial nuclear deal next month, because he sees it as being fatally flawed. The deal is still strongly backed by Britain, the EU, Russia, China and the UN-sponsored watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency. All remain adamant that inspections show Iran has and continues to abide by its principles.Indeed, during a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela Merkel.          The Israeli leader said that the \u0027atomic archive\u0027 where Iran kept its files was in the Shorabad District of the capital, TehranBut is Mr Trump listening more closely to his old friend Mr Netanyahu?What we do know is that, as the deadline nears for Mr Trump’s decision on whether to re-ratify the nuclear deal, unprecedented threats and counter-threats of death and destruction are being hurled between Tehran and Tel Aviv.British government says it has \u0027never been naive\u0027 about...Share this articleIn the past few weeks, each has promised to destroy the other’s major cities if threatened, raising fears that the proxy war they have been waging in Syria may soon explode into a direct military confrontation.We should remember that over the past few decades Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly, but erroneously, suggested that Iran is just months away from declaring it has developed a nuclear weapon. Still, it is easy to see why he is so paranoid. Since the revolution in 1979 brought the Shia Islam mullahs to power, the Tehran regime has proudly promoted the destruction of Israel as its top foreign policy objective.    During a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela MerkelWorse for Israel, the civil war in Syria has resulted in thousands of Iranian fighters joining thousands more militia men from Hezbollah, Iran’s main regional Shia ally, which has already fought numerous wars with Israel.Their ostensible aim was to help Assad fight Islamic State and other Islamist rebel groups, but that brutal experience means they are now battle-hardened, armed to the hilt and entrenched right on the Jewish state’s border.Until now, Russia – which is allied with Assad, Iran and Hezbollah, but also has warm relations with Israel – has played a delicate diplomatic balancing act, backing Israel’s enemies while turning a blind eye to the Jewish state attacks against them in Syria.          Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run outBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run out, and he has promised to deliver the advanced S-300 air defence missile system to Assad to help him defend against such aerial attacks. Israel responded by saying that any such system would be destroyed before it could become operational.It is easy to see, then, why the price of oil is soaring on the back of Mr Netanyahu’s claims yesterday. It’s a sign that the international markets are afraid supply will be disrupted by strife and conflict in the region.The great fear for diplomats around the world is that, if Mr Trump does decide to withdraw from the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions, Israel will launch unilateral strikes against what it says are Iran’s nuclear facilities. That would almost certainly provoke a devastating military response – not just from Tehran, but also its allies in Syria and Lebanon.And if that happens, it will take a massive effort of will to stop America and Russia coming to the aid of their allies – at which point the risks of a global conflict will rise sharply.

It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.Remainer Lords vote to strip Theresa May of ability to walk...\u0027I will do whatever it takes to put this right\u0027: Sajid Javid...Share this articleA law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government. At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’.But yesterday Ken Clarke told the BBC: ‘I agree with some of my predecessors you cannot control illegal immigration until you have identity cards in this country which unfortunately were proposed, supported by the Conservative Party at first and then ditched a few years ago.          When Theresa May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary‘Trying to control mass immigration of the kind we now have coming from Africa and the Middle East without an identity card law is I think impossible.‘The Blair government made a bit of a mess of overcomplicating it, it would have taken years to introduce but an ID system would have helped.‘What you don’t want is these kinds of policies to be applied to elderly British citizens who came here legally and have been working, paying taxes all their lives.’ Charles Clarke and Mr Johnson argued in a letter to the Times that the decision to abandon ID cards was ‘ideological and unwise’. Britain should adopt them like most major European countries, they argued.They said Britain had an ID card system when the Empire Windrush migrants docked in 1948 and through until 1952. ‘It’s time to put identity cards back on the political agenda and give everyone confidence that those using our services are fully entitled to do so,’ they said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/19/4BB5DC6F00000578-0-image-a-29_1525112343926.jpg","title":"ALEX BRUMMER Sainsburys Asda deal designed cover shortcomings","story":"    Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealingsIn these pages yesterday, I argued that the deal was misguided because it could limit choice and convenience for customers. And as the financial details of the merger were revealed early yesterday, my phone rang off the hook.Sainsbury’s most senior executives were clearly fearful that regulators and politicians will be more concerned about potential harm to consumers and suppliers than with the positive impact for investors.I was assured by one of the architects of the deal that it must be a ‘win-win’ situation.Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealings.Astonishing moment Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...Share this article    Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe (pictured) wants to win consumer support with the promise of ‘lower prices by 10 per cent on many of the products customers buy regularly’This is not quite true, however, because Walmart will be the biggest shareholder in the new Sainsbury’s-Asda set-up with 42 per cent of the shares and a third of the votes in the company. There is always excitement when a major merger is announced, but experience tells me that when the public-relations machine is running at full tilt, one should never allow spin to outweigh basic economics.Consumers shouldn’t kid themselves that Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe’s 10 per cent price reductions will necessarily mean an overall cut in the cost in a shopping basket across the huge range of branded, own label and fresh produce goods offered by the new group.Other concerns were aired in Parliament yesterday, where MPs expressed fears not only about job security, but also on whether supermarkets would close in their areas.Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long run. The thinking is that, if there are only Sainsbury’s and Asda stores in a given area, they could effectively operate a monopoly and so one would have to be sold off to a rival supermarket chain.Analysis suggests that, as a result of such overlap, as many as 75 Asda stores will have to be disposed of if this merger is to have any chance of winning approval.Such a large estment could undermine the financial rationale for the deal, and could take years to complete at a time when the whole retail sector is under stress. It is suggested that the new merged company will seek to keep the Sainsbury and Asda brands separate, with the former maintaining its focus on quality, and Asda continuing to push cheaper own-brand products which will compete with the upstart discounters like Lidl and Aldi.But Sainsbury’s tried this with Dutch discounter Netto, and ended up losing £20million after having to close a series of stores where the brands had been sited together.    Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long runLargely the brainchild of Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s and his ex-colleague Dave Cheesewright at Asda, this merger has been two years in the making. Both firms have been trying to figure out how to deal with the huge global threat from Amazon, which arguably has the best logistics, warehousing and delivery technology, as well as almost unlimited financial resources.Amazon is challenging Asda owner Walmart in the US with the purchase of bricks-and-mortar retail firm Whole Foods Market, and starting to make incursions in the UK, too. Sainsbury’s argues it is in a strong position to integrate Asda because both companies have embraced the best of new technology.Be that as it may, we should heed the lessons of last week’s disastrous IT meltdown at the TSB – that technological change can be chaotic if companies get it wrong.Sainsbury’s is still digesting IT and distribution changes that came with the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail Group two years ago.The Sainsbury’s-Asda merger gives the impression of being a sensible deal designed to create a new leader in British shopping. But like many big mergers, it is a roll of the dice designed in part to cover-up grave shortcomings in the strategy of the managements concerned. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/16/4B92989300000578-0-image-m-116_1524758274646.jpg","title":"Land value levy cost families 10 000 year","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, who has praised the Labour Land Campaign (LLC) which calls for a new levy based on the value of land a home is built onPub angers community by putting parking meters in car park...Council unveils plan to restrict foreign languages on...Share this articleLLC suggests charging as much as £96,534 a year for a three-bedroom home in the richest part of London. Residents of Band D homes in parts of Manchester would pay £11,239 per year and those in Bristol £9,567.Critics warn it would hit London and the South-East the hardest, putting at risk lower-income households and those who bought their ex-council houses at a discount under the right-to-buy scheme.The LLC is not affiliated to the Labour Party, and a party spokesman said a land value tax was not Labour policy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/00/4BB3602000000578-0-image-m-18_1525131196230.jpg","title":"Pharmacy grade Xanax sold openly Instagram","story":"    Reporters discovered that a pharmacy-grade version of the highly-addictive drug was being sold on InstagramOne pharmacist in central London, Anatolijus Kostiukevicius, sold Xanax and the highly addictive painkiller tramadol to an undercover reporter without a prescription.

This is what happened to me.I can trace its beginnings to my older sister’s hen do, surrounded by her beautiful friends. They all had perfect jobs, perfect skin, perfect bodies. I’d just finished drama school, was in debt and living with my parents, and had no plan.Later, chatting to a friend, I said I wasn’t feeling good: bloated, foggy brain, generally ‘bleugh’. She recommended a ‘clean living’ book. ‘It will change your life,’ she said. ‘It teaches you how to be kind to your body, your skin, your weight, your mind, your energy levels, everything.’ An easy sell.I was a healthy size 8-10.  Daniella posted flattering photos on social media, despite suffering from an eating disorderI’d been diagnosed with coeliac disease (an auto-immune condition where the body reacts to gluten) a few years earlier, so I had already cut gluten out of my diet, but otherwise I enjoyed food and ate a varied diet.But the book insisted I cut out dairy, then sugar and then meat and grains.Then, it promised, I would be clean. I would feel better.Why getting a dog is so good for you: People raised in...Should you be worried about E. coli in your lunchtime salad?...Which tea to drink to make you healthier, happier and...A stick-on skin patch for hay fever that blocks the release...Share this articleI joined my local gym, too — and along with my new diet, it gave me a much sought-after routine. It was around this time I downloaded the social media app Instagram. I started posting about my progress online and got endless compliments. I finally felt I was in control.And I was supported by a whole community. Bloggers such as Deliciously Ella, Honestly Healthy, Clean Eating Alice — they were all there to inspire me. The weight dropped off. It became my religion.Then, a theatre show I’d created and acted in transferred to Australia. This is where my ‘clean’ lifestyle went up a gear. My days consisted of exercise first thing, brunch (so I didn’t have to eat breakfast and lunch) of avocado and eggs, and later a vegetable-filled dinner.  Daniella was inspired by bloggers such as Deliciously Ella (left) and Clean Eating Alice (right) When I came back to London, I couldn’t get off the wellness treadmill. I started ghost-writing for ‘clean living’ brands, developing recipes. I even launched a brand of granola.The job was the perfect way to retain total control: alcohol was banned from events, every menu was free from sugar and gluten, and detailed descriptions of exercise routines were accepted as dinner party conversation.After about six months of eating clean, my sister and mum voiced their concerns to me, but I ignored them.Even when a wellness expert I was writing for took me to one side and said my lifestyle was getting ‘excessive’ . . . I didn’t listen.It was only in November 2016 that I began to reassess. My sister announced she was pregnant — it was a sharp wake-up call reminding me that I hadn’t had a period in over two years.  Daniella moved to Australia where her eating disorder worsenedI went to the gynaecologist who said that although my weight was within the ‘normal’ range, my oestrogen level was non-existent. He explained that to conserve energy, my body had stopped releasing the hormone.I now know that I was in the grip of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised as an unhealthy obsession with healthy living. The doctor didn’t diagnose this specifically, because it is not yet officially recognised by medical bodies.But once I had explained my lifestyle to him, it was clear my disorder was far from rare. ‘If you were a plant,’ he said, ‘you’d be withered and on your way out. Your body hasn’t been nourished in a long time. You need to learn to love yourself again. What are you scared of?’I hated the question. I was scared of the thoughts in my head, scared of being a failure.I knew I had to change if I wanted to bring my periods back. I felt angry at the wellness world. I’d spent so much time, money and headspace obsessively following the rules, only for them to make me sick.          Daniella would eat just avocado and eggs for brunch and vegetables for dinnerThe gynaecologist suggested therapy, but I wasn’t ready for deep reflection (and the NHS waiting list was long), so I turned to a group I found on Facebook called ‘No period, now what?’ Here, I found hundreds of women like me. Many had fallen into orthorexic habits.Their advice was simple: ‘Let go’. No rules, no recipes, no detoxes, no cleanses, no selfies.I started with small, incremental steps. I’d miss one day of exercise, I’d have porridge for breakfast instead of a smoothie. Then, I’d let friends choose where we went for dinner. I ate carbs, real carbs.I hated seeing my body change. My hard-earned abs turned to soft rolls. I had bursts of rage and deep sadness. I felt like a failure, mentally and physically.Each month I went back to the fertility clinic for blood tests. I’d be surrounded by women who were hoping to get pregnant I was just hoping to feel like a woman again.It took six weeks before my oestrogen level rose. After four months my period came back, just in time for opening night of my new show, Hear Me Raw.I wanted the production to reveal the dirty truth behind the clean living movement.Because despite how it might have looked on Instagram, I had never felt less well. The so-called wellness industry isn’t really selling wellness, is it? It’s the diet industry dressed up in candy-coloured phrases of empowerment. And it’s making us sick."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4BAB49F100000578-0-image-a-2_1524987300622.jpg","title":"London born scientist flies Swiss clinic end life regrets having lived 104","story":"    Australia\u0027s oldest scientist , Dr David Goodall (pictured), wants to fly to Switzerland to end his life          Dr Goodall (pictured middle) does not have a terminal illness but greatly regrets having lived to 104Dr Goodall was born in London in 1914, and is an eminent botanist and ecologist. He came to Australia to in 1948, taking up a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne.   Dr Goodall celebrated his 104th birthday in early April and has since decided it is time to access voluntarily euthanasia in Switzerland.\u0027People who are gravely ill should have their pain relieved,...Landmark euthanasia bill passes as Victoria becomes the...Share this articleWest Australia is still in the process of introducing voluntary euthanasia laws which would be restricted to people with a terminal illness. Premier Mark McGowan said the government would not assist Dr Goodall due to the fact he is not suffering from a terminal illness.

We are present in this country at the request of the government of Syria,\u0027 said Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, spokesman for parliamentary national security and foreign policy commission. The Syrian government has focused its efforts in 2018 on securing the capital Damascus, the heart of which was spared the worst of the seven-year-old conflict but was long surrounded by rebel-held pockets.Backed by massive Russian military support, the regime took full control of the Eastern Ghouta enclave earlier this month.The sprawling semi-rural area east of Damascus had been home to thousands of armed Islamist and jihadist fighters, who were besieged for years but sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds on the capital.Pro-regime forces are now battling jihadists from the Islamic State group and other armed groups in southern neighbourhoods of Damascus.After days of air strikes and heavy fighting, state media reported late Sunday that those areas would be evacuated under deals similar to those that emptied other enclaves around Damascus in recent weeks.Buses started arriving Monday near Yarmuk, a neighbourhood once home to a Palestinian refugee camp and the main hub of IS forces in southern Damascus, state media reported.The transfer deal does not include IS fighters, but other jihadists from a former Al-Qaeda affiliate who control pockets inside Yarmuk, Abdel Rahman said. Netanyahu Says Israel Has Proof Iran Cheated on Nuclear Deal - The AtlanticNuclear Iran: The Birth of an Atomic State: David Patrikarakos: 9781780761251: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/17/4BB587A800000578-5674835-image-a-49_1525104074634.jpg","title":"Man asks internet sick day shown no mercy living room","story":"    The mirror took the most online abuse when the Reddit user asked for adviceA man who was pulling a sickie from work was savaged by angry Reddit users after asking how to spend his day off.The man posted an image of him from what appears to be his sofa, under a blanket and infront of the TV.He captioned it: \u0027Sick day today.

That is why the IAEA inspection regime agreed as part of the Iran nuclear deal is one of the most extensive and robust in the history of international nuclear accords,\u0027 a British government spokesman said in a statement.\u0027It remains a vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal and that Iran\u0027s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\u0027 Intelligence experts and diplomats said Netanyahu did not seem to have presented a \u0027smoking gun\u0027 showing that Iran had violated the agreement, although he may have helped make a case on behalf of hawks in the U.S. administration who want to scrap it.          In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027    The premier accused the Islamic Republic of \u0027brazenly lying\u0027 to the United States and Europe by maintaining nuclear materials in a secret location - a violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action          Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his intelligence services have obtained documents proving that Iran maintained a secret nuclear program in violation of a landmark agreement Tehran reached with the West. Netanyahu points to a slide which is purported to show \u0027massive safes\u0027 where Iran\u0027s \u0027secret archive\u0027 were storedMost of the purported evidence Netanyahu unveiled dated to the period before the 2015 accord was signed, although he said Iran had also kept important files on nuclear technology since then, and continued adding to its \u0027nuclear weapons knowledge\u0027.Tehran dismissed Netanyahu as \u0027the boy who cried wolf\u0027, and called his presentation propaganda.President Donald Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the international deal unless it is renegotiated by May 12. After Netanyahu spoke, Trump repeated his criticism of the deal, suggesting he backed the Israeli leader\u0027s remarks.\u0027Iran\u0027s leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,\u0027 Netanyahu said at Israel\u0027s Defence Ministry, standing in front of stacks of files representing what he described as a vault full of Iranian nuclear documents obtained weeks before.\u0027I will do whatever it takes to put this right\u0027: Sajid Javid...Trump says he\u0027s been \u0027100 per cent right\u0027 about Iran\u0027s...\u0027If we can\u0027t fix it, he\u0027s going to withdraw\u0027: Pompeo tells...Share this article\u0027Tonight I\u0027m here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.\u0027\u0027Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons programme,\u0027 he said. \u0027One hundred thousand secret files prove it did. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.\u0027Although the presentation was live on Israeli television, Netanyahu made clear that his audience was abroad: he delivered most of his speech in English, before switching to Hebrew.Netanyahu said he had shared the intelligence with the United States and would dispatch envoys to France and Germany to present it. He also spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Tehran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses its arch-foe Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it.          Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that Iran is keen to develop ties with the rest of the world, which is \u0027not merely\u0027 the United States and European countriesA senior European diplomat told Reuters: \u0027We knew all of this and what especially stands out is that Netanyahu doesn\u0027t speak of any recorded violations\u0027 of the deal itself.Speaking after Netanyahu\u0027s presentation, Trump told a White House news conference the nuclear deal was \u0027a horrible agreement for the United States\u0027. He said it would let Tehran develop nuclear arms after seven years and had \u0027proven right what Israel has done today\u0027 with Netanyahu\u0027s disclosures.However, Washington itself has concluded that Iran has not violated the deal\u0027s terms.

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of having a secret plan called ‘Project Amad’, whose goal is to produce five ten-kiloton nuclear weapons.This unverified claim will of course have been music to the ears of Donald Trump and the anti-Iran hawks the President has surrounded himself with in the White House.Even before this dramatically theatrical display from Israel, Mr Trump appeared determined to scrap the controversial nuclear deal next month, because he sees it as being fatally flawed. The deal is still strongly backed by Britain, the EU, Russia, China and the UN-sponsored watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency. All remain adamant that inspections show Iran has and continues to abide by its principles.Indeed, during a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela Merkel.

Still, it is easy to see why he is so paranoid. Since the revolution in 1979 brought the Shia Islam mullahs to power, the Tehran regime has proudly promoted the destruction of Israel as its top foreign policy objective.    During a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela MerkelWorse for Israel, the civil war in Syria has resulted in thousands of Iranian fighters joining thousands more militia men from Hezbollah, Iran’s main regional Shia ally, which has already fought numerous wars with Israel.Their ostensible aim was to help Assad fight Islamic State and other Islamist rebel groups, but that brutal experience means they are now battle-hardened, armed to the hilt and entrenched right on the Jewish state’s border.Until now, Russia – which is allied with Assad, Iran and Hezbollah, but also has warm relations with Israel – has played a delicate diplomatic balancing act, backing Israel’s enemies while turning a blind eye to the Jewish state attacks against them in Syria.          Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run outBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run out, and he has promised to deliver the advanced S-300 air defence missile system to Assad to help him defend against such aerial attacks. Israel responded by saying that any such system would be destroyed before it could become operational.It is easy to see, then, why the price of oil is soaring on the back of Mr Netanyahu’s claims yesterday. It’s a sign that the international markets are afraid supply will be disrupted by strife and conflict in the region.The great fear for diplomats around the world is that, if Mr Trump does decide to withdraw from the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions, Israel will launch unilateral strikes against what it says are Iran’s nuclear facilities. That would almost certainly provoke a devastating military response – not just from Tehran, but also its allies in Syria and Lebanon.And if that happens, it will take a massive effort of will to stop America and Russia coming to the aid of their allies – at which point the risks of a global conflict will rise sharply. Once again, the tinder box Middle East threatens to drag two of the world’s great powers to the edge of the abyss. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/23/4BB4DD1600000578-0-image-a-22_1525127609121.jpg","title":"Spotify music downloads reveal mood nation Bank England claim","story":"    Music downloaded from Spotify can give decision-makers an insight into consumer moods, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist‘Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence,’ he said, referring to an important monthly survey in the United States.‘And why stop at music?

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

It was Pound who introduced him to vorticism, the short-lived British avant garde modernist movement created by artist and writer Wyndham Lewis as a reaction to the dominance of landscape and figurative art. Equally frustrated by the representative nature of photography, Langdon Coburn immediately sensed the liberating potential of the vorticist dynamic of geometric shapes and cubist fragmentation. In the Shape of Light, Langdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow, made using a set of mirrors to fragment the subject in an almost kaleidoscopic way, set the tone for an epic exhibition that traces the history of photography as experiment. Here, portraiture, landscape and documentary give way to abstractions – created either by manipulations of light and chemicals or by distorting or fragmenting the actual world. The result is a kind of mirror-history of the medium’s relationship to documentary and abstract art.  Spread over 12 rooms, Shape of Light is also a history of innovation, in which the darkroom and the studio are more akin to the laboratory. The early-to-mid-century masters of light and form are all present: Brassaï, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, their embrace of abstraction a kind of compliment to their more traditional documentary work. Their often stark monochrome photographs are contrasted with the formalist paintings of Braque and Kandinsky as well as the shiny curves of a gold Brancusi sculpture, Maiastra (1911), which Steichen must surely have been aware of when he made his oddly mystical study, Bird in Space, 15 years later. It is instructive, too, to see an image from Germaine Krull’s still-undervalued series Métal (1928), a hymn to the angularity and materiality of steel, and to contrast it with the cleaner lines of Margaret Bourke-White’s ground-level view of the NBC Transmission Tower (1934). In a room entitled New Vision, the work of the great self-taught Hungarian modernist, László Moholy-Nagy, inevitably dominates. His painting K VII (1922), a minimalist arrangement of lines and blocks of colour, is echoed in an untitled photograph by him from the same year and, much later, in Mondrian’s supremely ordered arrangement of colour and form, Composition C (No 111) With Red, Yellow, Blue from 1935. Similarly in the following two rooms, the restlessly innovative imagination of Man Ray makes its presence felt. One of his mysterious rayographs from 1922 is an early example of camera-less photography made by placing everyday objects directly on to photosensitised paper and exposing them to light.Both artists cast a long shadow: Moholy-Nagy in his architectural understanding of scale, angle and detail, and his subversion of the same Man Ray in his seemingly instinctive grasp of photography as an essentially surrealist medium, capable of bending the real out of shape in astonishing ways. Bafflingly, though, there is not a trace of one of photography’s great female pioneers, Berenice Abbott, who made formally brilliant architectural photographs of modernist New York as well as pioneering scientific images of great beauty – including what she called her “rayograms-in-motion” – that surely deserved inclusion here.  In a show that tends towards the cerebral, it is a relief to encounter some more tactile nudes by Brassaï and Imogen Cunningham, in which the curves and surfaces of the female body retain a palpable sensuality. Bill Brandt’s distorted female forms, though, seem a little too forced in comparison. All three of the aforementioned artists could have featured in room eight, which is titled Surface and Texture. It begins with three images from Brassaï’s Graffiti series, in which he photographed anonymous carvings and etchings made on the walls of Paris, some recognisably representational, some abstract, all seeming to hark back to older forms of expression such as cave drawings. More intriguing still are Aaron Siskind’s photographs of cracked, peeling paint on weathered surfaces, which possess a tangible sense of materiality and a tonal quality that speaks of time passing and, with it, the slow, inexorable decay of buildings, objects and those who created them.  This is an exhibition that demands a constant attentiveness to detail and, as such, will repay a second or even third visit. The sheer amount of work on display is at times overwhelming and here and there the endless riffs on angular shapes, circles and patterns of light began to blur into a long series of slight variations on a single brilliant idea. In this context, Lewis Baltz’s almost blank minimalism is a much-needed breathing space. His evocation of the banality of postwar suburban American architecture – grey concrete surfaces in small frames – has a social, even political, undertow in that it draws attention in its deadpan way to the spread of these soulless environments. This is the mundane made abstract.  The final room is given over to contemporary abstraction and, perhaps inevitably, reflects the dilemma of current photographic practice in our profligate image culture. Both Maya Rochat and Daisuke Yokota, in their differing ways, subject their images to intense, almost destructive, transformative techniques using chemicals, heat, paint and, in Daisuke’s case, constant rephotographing, reprinting and rescanning. The visceral nature of their approach both degrades and heightens the photographic image and, by extension, the very idea of photography as a recording medium. The end results are images that are, among other things, traces of a process that is akin to improvisational music insofar as it allows, even thrives on, spontaneity and accident.  London-based Antony Cairns produces traces of a different kind, his shadow-images of London at night emanating an almost ghostly atmosphere that is both Ballardian and oddly Victorian. His silver gelatin prints are shown here behind glass plates in a large grid, each one a glimpse of a cityscape, indistinct yet recognisable, familiar yet unknowable.

I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide,” he added.Assisted suicide is illegal in most countries around the world and was banned in Australia until the state of Victoria became the first to legalise the practice last year. But that legislation, which takes effect from June 2019, only applies to terminally ill patients of sound mind and a life expectancy of less than six months.Other states in Australia have debated euthanasia in the past, but the proposals have always been defeated, mostly recently in New South Wales state last year. It was legalised in the Northern Territory, which is not a state, in 1995, but the commonwealth government overturned that legislation in 1997.Exit International, which is helping Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia’s “oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity”.“A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it. And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it,” it said on its website Monday.The group has launched a GoFundMe campaign to get plane tickets for Goodall and his helper upgraded to business class from economy and has so far raised more than A$17,000 ($13,000).Goodall, an honorary research associate at Perth’s Edith Cowan University, made international headlines in 2016 when he was declared unfit to be on campus.After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed.He has produced dozens of research papers and until recently continued to review and edit for different ecology journals. • This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to acknowledge the legalisation of euthanasia in the Northern Territory from 1995 to 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208a1feb51ad344580b20b9246670dddeb8bca5c/0_577_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2627a880ad7e465cb27bbf11201f1751","title":"transhumanism movement wins wellcome book prize mark o connell","story":"Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine, about humanity’s attempts to conquer death through technology, wins £30,000 prizeIrish debut author Mark O’Connell has won the Wellcome book prize for his exploration of transhumanism, a movement that seeks to use technology to solve “the modest problem of death”, as O’Connell puts it.To Be a Machine won the £30,000 award, which goes to the best work of fiction or non-fiction to “illuminate the many ways that health and medicine touch our lives”, at a ceremony in London on Monday night. O’Connell’s book saw off competition that included the Nigerian author Ayòbámi Adébáyò, nominated for Stay With Me, a novel about sickle cell disease, and Sigrid Rausing’s memoir about the impact of addiction on her family, Mayhem.Chair of judges Edmund de Waal called To Be a Machine a “passionate, entertaining and cogent examination of those who would choose to live for ever”.To Be a Machine sees the 38-year-old O’Connell meet with those working to conquer mortality through technology – from the self-proclaimed cyborgs who insert tech implants beneath their skin, to the developers trying to translate human minds into code. Exploring the beliefs and work of several high-profile transhumanists, including PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, inventor Elon Musk and Google’s head of engineering Ray Kurzweil, O’Connell also examines the philosophy and science behind the movement, as well as the opportunities and concerns it may create in the future.“What are my chances, would you say, of living to 1,000?” the author asks gerontologist Aubrey de Grey. “I would say perhaps a little better than fifty-fifty,” de Grey replies. “It’s very much dependent on the level of funding.”De Waal said: “Mark O’Connell brilliantly examines issues of technology and singularity. In doing so he brings into focus timely issues about mortality, what it might mean to be a machine and what it truly means to be human. It is also unequivocally readable, in that what it does is address hugely complicated areas of new science to do with AI and ethics, simultaneously. That’s very remarkable, to be able to traverse bits of cutting-edge scientific research and make something that is funny, engaged, cogent and lucid, all at the same time.”O’Connell, a journalist, essayist and literary critic, “hasn’t got multiple PhDs in this area,” said de Waal. “What he does have, which is critical, is an absolutely ferocious, forensic, enquiring mind. He drills down into what people are saying and gets them to reveal all kinds of complicated and ambiguous aspects to do with their desires and their aspirations. He looks at scientific discoveries through the messiness of human desire. That’s really difficult to do.”Previous winners of the Wellcome prize include Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and Marion Coutts’s The Iceberg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aeef2b8e471635f539ae6edc496e71be2df84d6/17_14_3435_2062/master/3435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3d2978eae424e832f57d6449100209c","title":"experts have their say on sainsburys asda merger","story":"From fears about job losses to a view of two businesses trying to ‘future-proof themselves’Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB:Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like ‘rationalisation’ in the name of ‘efficiency’.

In a speech about the possibilities created by big data, Haldane said it was “devilishly difficult” to work out how people felt because traditional surveys of market participants or the general public tended to be “biased in their sampling and framed in their responses”.He said researchers were using non-traditional methods in an attempt to understand consumer behaviour.“To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people’s sentiment.”Haldane said the results were at least as good at tracking consumer sentiment as the monthly Michigan University survey, which is considered by economists to be a good guide to how confident Americans are feeling.Multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft already had “primitive” economies attached to them that economists were studying, not only to gauge the public mood but also to assess how iniduals would respond to policy changes such as moves in interest rates or tougher regulations.“Indeed, in the latter role, the game could serve as a test bed for policy action – a large-scale dynamic, digital focus group.”Haldane noted that not all attempts to harness online searches have been successful. Google tried to predict flu outbreaks based on online searches with little success after a promising start.But he expressed confidence that big data would fulfil its promise and help the Bank of England “to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather.“Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows.

John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: “Ultimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices … customers will see reduced choice.”However, responding to an urgent question about the deal in parliament, the business minister, Andrew Griffiths, appeared to support the merger, saying the two grocers were trying “to get ahead of the curve” in a competitive market.The proposed merger of the UK’s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major competition inquiry. Analysts predicted that if the deal was approved, it would result in at least 75 store disposals to ensure competition did not suffer. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since Morrison bought Safeway in 2003, when dozens of stores changed hands.Sainsbury’s said the merger would not be completed until the second half of 2019 as regulators will have to calculate the potential overlaps between the two groups’ stores and the impact on local competition. Coupe, who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”. He insisted the merger would be “a great deal for everyone”, with benefits for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders.Coupe said the retail landscape had changed dramatically since the MorrisonsSafeway deal, with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl and online specialists led by Amazon.“It’s never been more competitive and customers have more choices than ever, not just in the grocery sector but in other retail sectors. You can see the consequences of that playing out every day,” Coupe said.The CMA confirmed the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury’s said it had asked the watchdog to skip straight to a detailed “phase two” stage.Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the impact on consumers who, he said, would benefit from lower prices and more choice in deciding how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least £500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers.John Hannett, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, said: “Both companies operate significant nationwide distribution networks employing thousands of staff. We will be seeking urgent clarification on the future for those workers.” Coupe admitted that some head office functions were likely to be combined over time but insisted new jobs would also be created. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be the current boss, Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury’s.Coupe insisted that the Sainsbury’s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by the association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices.The deal enables Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market, where it is struggling to compete with Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, which controls almost a third of the grocery market.Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: “We believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.”She said Walmart was interested in expanding the Sainsbury’s-owned Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e73c40fbf134863ac5f9d47e5fb4af5da97f76/0_455_1417_850/master/1417.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc43320a96f42ed5d2b9186eecd6530e 960w","title":"the guardian view on amber rudds resignation now change the policy","story":"This was a textbook example of the press holding government to account and a classic illustration of the importance of that effort. But it is not just Ms Rudd who was exposed by it. It was also the policy itself. The wish to expel an arbitrary level of illegal migrants managed to catch hundreds of legal arrivals – notably the Windrush-era migrants who arrived without modern papers – in the net. That should not have happened and it must cease.The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, must therefore change the policy as a priority. He made an effective start in the Commons on Monday, with a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to give justice and security to the Windrush cases. But he faces practical obligations too, including a comprehensive support and compensation programme for the Windrush families. He must also end a target culture that may encourage a culture of disbelief among officials. And he must provide a new adjudication system, with checks and balances, for handling cases, in order to reduce injustices. These are large challenges, but they are also a big opportunity to press the reset button.Targets are not wrong in principle. They can be useful tools for measuring the quantity and quality of delivery. But targets must also be fair, credible and should be understood and explained in the public interest. The hostile environment targets were none of these things. They were indiscriminate, unachievable and riddled with too much injustice and fear.Ms Rudd’s approach to them was cynical. She adopted fierce targets because that was the line of least resistance, politically speaking. It allowed her to prove her support for their ultimate author Theresa May, whom she rightly supported against the recklessness of the dogmatic Brexiters. But she also seemed a reluctant believer, unable and unwilling to make the case for them. In the end she was caught out saying one thing to one audience and a different thing to another. She should not have followed the policy in the first place – the public can sometimes be much fairer than politicians imagine – and she should not have blamed her officials when it all went wrong.Ms Rudd is a liberal pro-European Conservative. Her fall has been an object lesson in the perils facing liberal Tories when they allow cheap rightwing rhetoric to outweigh their better and more practical instincts in important areas of public policymaking. The Home Office has increasingly found itself an arena for this dilemma in recent decades. Successive home secretaries of all parties have lapsed into gesture politics and facile toughness rather than thinking calmly, strategically and effectively. They have been encouraged to do this by the tightness of public money in a continuingly low tax age, and by the tendency of political leaders, in the absence of expanding state welfare and spending projects, to try to justify themselves to an anxious public and a febrile press in more authoritarian ways. Yet it simply does not have be this way.Ms Rudd is the fourth member of Mrs May’s post-election cabinet, and its second senior woman, to go in just over 10 months. The wastage rate is high. It indicates the fragility of the cabinet, the government and the Tory party. It does not bode well for the Tories in the local elections. What it says above all, though, is that this government currently lacks the confidence, ability and shrewdness to generate effective and routinely fair policy delivery, making lives better and strengthening social solidarity. That is the larger task that Mr Javid must undertake if he can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af6a31c4908271160283b22fa0028231d0b79ad/0_0_1200_800/master/1200.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=719b73c48da0bf2ebe080d5b1e66c7ba 480w","title":"ministers 400m plan for electric car charging infrastructure delayed","story":"Plan for fund combining taxpayers’ cash and private investment significantly behind schedule, it has emergedA £400m government plan to build electric car charging points looks likely to be significantly delayed, in a blow to car manufacturers and efforts to tackle air pollution in UK cities.The Treasury pledged last year to support the switch to zero-emission vehicles with a £400m fund for charging infrastructure. Half of the money was to come from the taxpayer, with the rest matched by the private sector, according to an announcement in the autumn budget.However, nearly half a year later, it has emerged that the government has not even started the recruitment process for an official to raise the £200m of private investment – let alone begin the process of securing the funding. “We expect to launch the procurement for the private sector fund manager in summer 2018,” Robert Jenrick, a junior Treasury minister, said.In a written parliamentary answer, he said the government had been busy engaging with the private sector to ensure the fund was “set up in the most effective way”.Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “The government’s electric vehicles policy has run out of power before leaving the driveway. Ministers failed to admit they hadn’t secured a penny of investment and didn’t intend to raise anything in the near future. They have announced £200m that isn’t theirs and hasn’t been promised to them.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had called the support a “positive step to boost buyer confidence”.Electric vehicles are also a cornerstone of efforts to tackle dirty air in cities. Ministers have lost three legal battles over their failure to clean up air pollution as quickly as possible, as required under EU law.A delay to the government’s £400m electric charging plan could hamper efforts to reduce pollution from cars.

The operation is not painful for the butterfly, but experts and conservationists say the outcome for the animal is unknown, and efforts would be better directed towards cultivating flowers and plants that would attract and aid the wider population.“To many people it’s just a butterfly, but to me it’s worth trying to save. There’s nothing to lose,” wing surgeon Linda Archer told Stuff in New Zealand.“I’m a bit of a sook really, I just think you should help animals where you can.”Dr Jennifer Jandt, a specialist in social insects at the University of Otago said although the stories of monarch enthusiasts devotion was “moving”, their efforts may be in vain, as some were replacing the wings of female monarchs with male wings, which would interfere with the mating process and could confuse the insects.“As a human being I think this is a beautiful way to interact with nature. As a scientist I don’t see it as being an effective solution to the monarch issue,” said Jandt.“It is important to let nature take its course, because the stronger animals are the ones you want to stay in the population. A sick or injured inidual maybe has some sort of mutation, you don’t necessarily want that particular gene to perpetuate.”Monarch butterflies are mainly found in North America, Australia and New Zealand.Jacqui Knight from the Monarch Butterfly New Zealand Trust said videos of monarch wing transplants were largely produced in North America, and New Zealanders learnt techniques from the web and posted on forums asking for dead butterfly wings.Knight said New Zealanders devotion to the monarch butterfly started more than half a century ago, when images of monarchs were painted on the sides of buildings.“In New Zealand generally people are very attached to the monarch butterfly,” said Knight.“But we don’t view the surgery as very effective. The chances are that butterfly is deformed through disease or pathogens something that we can’t see. We think they should be left to their natural course.”Dr Jandt said if people wanted to make their gardens monarch friendly planting zinnias, milkweed or swan plants was a good start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bb23224e08bb948029743b524333069647a348/0_136_4078_2447/master/4078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e4d7707db8e46ede8dcf26b9a62ada","title":"juup heynckes denies real madrid complex but calls for bayern efficiency","story":"At the end of the final session at Bayern Munich’s Säbener Strasse training ground their players took penalties but Jupp Heynckes said it had nothing to do with the prospect of a shootout at the Bernabéu on Tuesday night.Instead, their manager claimed, the explanation was simpler than that: the practice match had finished in a draw. Heynckes said there was no way to recreate the pressure and tension of penalties and dismissed Franz Beckenbauer’s suggestion that Bayern have a “complex” when it comes to Real Madrid but he did appeal for his side to seek “inner peace” as they arrived in Spain looking to reach the Champions League final on 26\u0026nbspMay.Bayern were defeated 2-1 in Munich but Heynckes believes the first leg showed Madrid could be “hurt” and welcomed the prospect of the semi‑final being decided from 12 yards. Although he said there would be small changes, he insisted that above all his side needed to be more “efficient” than in the first leg, during which they racked up 18 shots but finished with a sixth successive defeat against their European rivals – a run that includes two in last season’s quarter-finals. Bayern lost 2-1 at home then as well but levelled the aggregate score in Madrid, taking the tie into extra time before being defeated 4-2.“Everyone saw we were defeated by two offside goals,” Thomas Müller said but the club’s honorary president had suggested there might be a different explanation. “There will never be a time when it’s so easy to beat them they weren’t brilliant,” Beckenbauer claimed three days ago. “I fear we have a complex with Madrid.”The other major problem they have is injuries: Jérôme Boateng, Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben, Kingsley Coman and Manuel Neuer are absent.“Recent losses play no part, because I wasn’t the coach then and tomorrow is a different team from last year,” Heynckes said. “For all of us here, what other people say is irrelevant – even if it is our president. This season we have shown we can be successful in close games and tomorrow will be very difficult for us but I think it will be for Real Madrid, too.“I have a lot of players with experience, internationals who have had success, and we come here to take our chance. We face a team that has been champion two years in a row, three times in four years, and are used to big games, but we never surrender and we want to be in the final. Faith moves mountains. If you want to win the Champions League, you have to have talent, good players, luck in the draw and in certain moments the right referee.“We have to have balance between attack and defence. Even if it sounds comic, we have to find an inner peace, that balance we had in 2013. I think we have a better squad now but in these big games we need leaders, people who step forward. That’s the art of great players.”It was put to Müller that he had never scored against Madrid and that Robert Lewandowski’s failure to score in the first leg had cost Bayern. “If you don’t win, people always look for a scapegoat. If we don’t score, people look at Lewandowski. But he has 28 goals and he is undisputed, a great striker. Ronaldo didn’t score in the first game either,” he said. “I didn’t know I hadn’t scored against Madrid. Maybe that’s extra motivation but personal stats don’t interest me much if the result is good without me scoring, fine. Although it wouldn’t be bad to score.”Zinedine Zidane, meanwhile, vowed that Madrid would attack, not seek to protect the lead, even if Sergio Ramos did claim that the most important factor would be “defensive seriousness” and that the counterattack might be key. Despite the probable absence of Isco and injury to Dani Carvajal, Zidane said: “Bayern are a great team and will go for it. We have to go out there to win, to score as soon as we can, without dropping back at all, without trying to contain the game or doing anything odd.”Asked which opponent he would prevent from playing if he could, Bayern’s former Madrid midfielder James Rodríguez said: “I’d take all 11 out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d557062a207bfbf3765c71526f44992eb0b94828/0_44_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ae86cb2ac1d9f0188b8510cc06410","title":"tottenham hotspur watford premier league match report","story":"If the result is all that matters at this late stage of the season, then Tottenham will reflect on this low-key victory with a measure of satisfaction. It did not bother Mauricio Pochettino that there were times when his bruised players tried too hard to extinguish their disappointment at failing to reach the FA Cup final. They still won with plenty left in the tank and, in the end, this was a timely reminder that the modern Tottenham possess more resolve than many of their predecessors.That is why Pochettino likes to speak about this young team’s development. The Argentinian has hardened their mentality and, while Tottenham’s wait for their first trophy since 2008 will not end this season, the bottom line is that they can guarantee a top-four finish by beating West Brom on Saturday and Newcastle next Wednesday.Dele Alli’s opener provided them with a springboard to move five points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea and Tottenham will pip Liverpool to third place if they win their final three matches. They endured some awkward moments here and Watford, who are still not arithmetically safe from relegation, felt aggrieved not to have won for the first time since 3 March. Harry Kane’s 38th goal of the season killed off Javi Gracia’s side, though, and left Pochettino praising his team’s response to losing their FA Cup semi-final to Manchester United last weekend.“It is important in the last few games that we win,” Pochettino said. “We were all disappointed. Our fans the same. You felt it. I am so proud of the mentality and commitment they showed.”The game was played in a subdued atmosphere, with plenty of empty seats dotted around the ground, and Spurs were often there for the taking. There was a slight air of edginess about their play and Pochettino frowned at his team’s tentativeness in the final third, especially when Kane spurned a decent shooting opportunity with an awkward piece of control in the 12th minute. Watford sensed an opportunity to exploit that unease, showing inventiveness on the break, and Spurs’ defenders were relieved to see Hugo Lloris deny Andre Gray in the 25th minute.The frustration for Watford, however, was that one defensive aberration had already undermined their enterprising approach by the time Gray saw his snapshot pushed away.A team with Tottenham’s attacking options rarely require a helping hand from their opponents and Orestis Karnezis will wince when he watches a replay of the mistake that handed the home team an undeserved lead.The threat looked minimal when Kieran Trippier whipped a cross towards the near post from the right flank. It should have been a routine catch for Karnezis. Instead, the Watford goalkeeper was distracted by Christian Kabasele ducking underneath the ball and his fumble presented Christian Eriksen with the chance to tee up Alli, who drove a low shot into the unguarded net.However, Pochettino was mistaken if he thought that isolated show of composure from Alli would settle his players. Watford targeted Tottenham’s unconvincing high line, forcing Lloris to race out of his area to beat Abdoulaye Doucouré to a through-ball, and all that was missing was a touch of ruthlessness.A lovely backheel from Will Hughes released Doucouré, who shot straight at Lloris, and Richarlison also had an effort pushed away after combining with Gray. “We conceded a few chances but Lloris showed fantastic skills in goal,” Pochettino said. His side would make Watford regret their generosity. “We conceded cheap goals,” Gracia said. “When we created chances we didn’t score.”Tottenham emerged with renewed focus at the start of the second half and normal service was resumed when Kane made it 2-0. The goal stemmed from one of those flowing moves that have made Spurs so enjoyable to watch under Pochettino, Eriksen shuffling a pass to Alli, who poked the ball through to Son Heung-min on the left. Son wasted no time turning the ball across goal and, although Kane slipped in the middle, the striker sprung back to his feet to meet Trippier’s centre with a crisp shot.Watford, winless on their travels since 25 November, had been put in their place. Richarlison contrived to fire over from close range and Gerard Deulofeu had a goal correctly ruled out for offside. But despite losing Mousa Dembélé to an ankle injury, Tottenham closed out the game after Kane’s goal.The striker has looked out of sorts since returning from an ankle injury and he is still playing himself back into form. Yet his importance to this team has never been in doubt and, with Gareth Southgate in the stands, this was a good time for England’s best hope at the World Cup to rediscover his scoring touch."},{"url":null,"title":"best new android iphone games 2018","story":"Be a neighbourhood god in The Sims Mobile, a Viking hero in Oddmar or start a craft beer empire in Brew Town. Along with Fortnite, Evoland 2, Trick Shot 2 and more new mobile games to tryThe first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel.A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself.Oddmar sounds like a standard action game about a Viking hero searching for his lost village while ridding the local forest of critters. What sets it apart is the sheer craft that’s gone into it, from its super-smooth animation as Oddmar leaps through the 24 beautiful (and visually varied) levels to its finely honed touch controls – often an Achilles heel for this genre on mobile. You can breeze through in a matter of hours, but the challenges on each level – from collecting coins to finishing as quickly as possible – give you more for your money.Building on the crafting’n’survival principles that Minecraft popularised and countless other games have refined and experimented with, The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands has you building a settlement in a snowy wasteland by day, then protecting it from monster attacks by night. This day-night cycle gives the game an enthralling rhythm, as you unlock new buildings to craft and uncover more of its story (which, although it falls into the “mysterious ancient civilisations” trope, isn’t too stale).Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops.2015’s Trick Shot was a slow-burning hit: a set of minimalist physics puzzles created by one of the designers of Monument Valley. This sequel keeps the stripped-down “get the ball in the box” idea, with a think-test-repeat dynamic to making best use of the buttons, teleporters, levers and other items. The inclusion of a level editor is heartening too. The majority of players may not have the patience to create their own puzzles, but the ones that do can share them with the community – which should ensure a steady supply of new trick shots to master.“A dark world plagued by beasts and demons” is a setup we’ve seen before, but never quite in this context. Keep in Mind’s hero is Jonas, whose own darkness encompasses alcoholism and depression. His night-time “mirror” world is the key to confronting his issues. The developer created the game for playersfacing their own mental-health issues, and it deserves a wide audience. The exploration and monster interactions are relatively simple, but the message stays with you long after you’ve completed it.One of the first big App Store hits in 2008 was a novelty app to pour a virtual pint. 10 years later, we have games about brewing craft beer. This sits in an accessible spot between full business simulation and mobile-friendly “clicker” game, with a smooth path from your first brew to a thriving business. It’s impossible not to be enjoyably sidetracked by the game’s label-designer section, welding decals, shapes and lettering together for your own ugly-beautiful beer labels.Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience.If you ’re familiar with Final Fantasy XV, it’s unlikely you’ll want to play it on a phone, but this edition is an excellent introduction for everyone else. It is a unique and endearing mix of road trip and Japanese fantasy, starring a boyband-esque group of friends who spend as much time tooling around in an open-topped sports car as they do battling monsters. It’s simplified well for touchscreens: the characters fight for themselves, with you influencing the action through well-timed taps to dodge, block and use special attacks. Final Fantasy is an acquired taste, but try the first episode for free to see if you like it. The next two cost 99p each, and the final seven cost £3.99 apiece.The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic.Kitty Powers is the drag alter ego of games developer Richard Franke and the star of 2014’s Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker, which saw her (and you) matching cartoon clients for a dating agency. This sequel is about those successfully matched couples, who are now falling in love – and you are a God-like figure in charge of their town. Getting up and running takes a while, but you’ll soon be learning your villagers’ likes and dislikes and enthusiastically barging in on their romantic lives. It’s a nice twist on Sims-style, life-management genre.This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming.More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler which will likely have you missing your train or bus stop, such is its one-more-go factor.“You control the level, not the character” isn’t an original twist, but in the right hands it can be inventive, as developer Alike Studio proves here. Your job is to guide alien hero Polo through a host of platform levels to find his kidnapped pet. Swipe vertical sections of the level up or down to swap in different obstacles and items before sending Polo through to see how he fares. It’s a cross between a game and a children’s mix-and-match book: pretty tough, but rarely frustrating. Already popular on consoles, Death Squared has you sliding two miniature robots through more than 80 levels, manipulating mechanisms and avoiding triggering traps to ensure both reach their end markers. You can play alone but Death Squared’s main appeal is as a co-op game for two players, each controlling a robot with gestures on one half of the screen. It’s less fiddly on an iPad, and one of the better family games of 2018, even though it wasn’t especially designed for children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2577555a6130b19b567a9d3b3df5e302d55231/184_384_4996_2997/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc526dc8be4c3c37ca2538c64bf9693","title":"disappearing jobs around the world in pictures","story":"Before May Day, AFP’s video and photo teams spoke to men and women around the globe whose jobs are becoming increasingly rare as technology transforms societies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/71_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb43c929806bbd6ffaa84c3d196cc961","title":"fresh lords defeat for government makes no deal less likely","story":"Cross-party amendment, passed with support of 19 Tory rebels, is seventh Lords defeat for government on EU withdrawal billThe government has suffered a heavy defeat on a crucial Lords vote that could pave the way for parliament to send ministers back to the Brussels negotiations if MPs vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Labour said the amendment, which is the seventh Lords defeat for the government on the EU withdrawal bill, would effectively prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal. The cross-party amendment was supported by 19 Tory rebels, winning by a majority of 91.Ministers have previously warned that should parliament vote down the deal agreed by negotiators, Britain would leave the bloc with no agreement. The amendment, led by former Tory minister Douglas Hogg, would change that scenario, meaning parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is designed to enhance Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, guaranteeing MPs a vote on the final deal, which won a shock victory in the Commons in December.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote “a hugely significant moment in the fight to ensure parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no-deal situation”.The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the amendment “puts parliament in the driving seat”.Rebel Tory sources have said they hope to attract cross-party support in the Commons for the plan, giving remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging Brexit deal without the fear that it will trigger a “no deal” outcome where the consequences would be worse.During the debate, Hogg told peers the clause was “designed to ensure that the future of our country is determined by parliament and not by ministers”.He said a choice between accepting the terms or crashing out of the EU would not be a genuine choice. “This is not regaining control. To act in such a manner would be to impose ministerial decisions on parliament by coercion,” he said, calling it “an elective dictatorship of a particularly flagrant kind”.Echoing Margaret Thatcher, under whom he said he was “privileged to serve”, Hogg said his response was: “No, no no!”He called the referendum vote “at the very best an interim decision” and said the public could not have predicted the terms of the UK’s departure.Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts said he was deeply concerned about the sweeping powers of the government, likening it to the 1933 Enabling Act conferring absolute power on Adolf Hitler. “Perhaps I’m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible,” he said. Later in the debate, the Brexit-backing Green party peer Jenny Jones said she had come to the House of Lords prepared to vote for the amendment on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, but said she had been put off by the speeches of pro-remain peers.“Quite honestly, the speeches in favour have turned me against them,” she said. “There is clearly more of an agenda than control of the process.”Speaking after the vote, Lord Callanan, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the amendment would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely”.The government also lost a vote on a cross-party amendment led by Labour peer John Monks, which would give parliament even greater powers over the Brexit negotiations, though Lords sources played down the significance of the victory. Peers voted to back the amendment by 270 to 233.The amendment calls on ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate – similar to the process that exists at the EU level, where leaders of the EU27 approve the mandate of Michel Barnier’s negotiating team.Brexiters have said it fundamentally undermines the government. Writing for the Sun, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical – because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.“Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give parliament the power to micromanage the government on how to carry out these negotiations.”Davis said the change would give the EU commission “a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb413fa9479d4d4a226af8ed512738d47e6043b/0_8_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b305bc0ba61b290e8dcf460ad0900fef","title":"hes a classic arch thatcherite readers on sajid javid as home secretary","story":"After Amber Rudd resigned following the publication of a deportation targets letter, you’ve been sharing your reaction Javid is a classic arch-Thatcherite his ethnicity doesn’t enter into it. He voted for every policy that created the current disaster that is the Home Office. He will do absolutely nothing to improve the situation.Javid’s appointment was the obvious no brainer appointment as home secretary. It also puts him a very strong position to take over from May should she be pushed under the wheels of a bus by furious Brexiteers or when she eventually steps down voluntarily. It also opens up a whole new possible Tory voter demographic against Labour under Corbyn should the above happen. There is no way a Brexiteer (I totally discount Gove, Johnson, Fox, Leadsom or Davis as serious contenders) could unite the Tory party in the event of May’s political demise and must also be a set back for Hunt and Williamson’s leadership ambitions.No surprises there then - Sajid Javid certainly fits the image the Tories want to portray while being a loyal ally. The noose still needs to tighten around the neck of May though, but we all know that senior Tories need her in place to take the crap for Brexit. What political intrigue we have.Had to be Javid, not much choice out of the ghastly MPs on offer. I don’t have any time for him myself, I don’t think he has been a very successful minister for housing and I think he is more a stop gap until the next reshuffle.Well, that was all a bit embarrassing wasn’t it. No minister in the past would have carried on in the way Rudd has done, but at last she has done the right thing unlike many of her peers in the current Tory party that continue to cling on. Where does this leave May? Exposed, that’s where. She was the architect of the hostility to immigrants policy, the buck stops with her. And then there’s Brexit. How can the government carry on pretending it has the authority, and the backing from the British people, to carry on imposing Brexit on us?After reading about Windrush, why should anyone in the EU27 trust the UK Home Office to protect the rights of EU27 citizens living in the UK post-Brexit? Mr Barnier should insist on a strong role for the European Court of Justice regarding those rights post-Brexit.Oh look, Theresa May has thrown another person under the bus. At a point, this tactic of blaming somebody else for her own blunders will fail because there will be no more people left to throw under the bus. This policy was as much her baby’s as Rudd’s. I hope Rudd’s resignation will not be the end of it.Do strong and stable governments typically see four cabinet ministers resign in disgrace within six months?This week could be brilliant. We’ve had a ministerial resignation, next up the palaver over the new minister, then a massive kicking for the Tories at the local elections. I suspect Boris will see this as his opportunity and will strike with all his snake-like guile and May will go. Then all we need is for Boris to be Boris and this government will come crashing down.Tomorrow is the beginning of May.

The government has defended the hostile environment policy as primarily targeted at “illegal immigrants”. A person as opposed to an action, however, cannot be illegal. And it is unwise to use harsh, derogatory language about people.To promote constructive dialogue among more than 700 people from 50-plus countries at the first World Congress on Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health being held in Edinburgh (17-19 May), we have recommended using “irregular migrant”, defined as: “A person who, owing to unauthorized entry, breach of a condition of entry, failure to gain asylum, or the expiry of his or her visa, lacks legal authorisation to reside in the country where they find themselves.”Such a change would be a step towards rebuilding the tarnished reputation of this country in relation to immigration policy and race relations.Professor Raj BhopalChairperson, First World Congress of Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health• So another piece of political theatre comes to its denouement with Amber Rudd’s resignation. Conservative Home Office scandals are as predictable as pantomimes and come with their own time-honoured tropes including: cruel heartless and usually racist Tories and their selfless Labour opponents championing the\u0026nbspunderdog.Behind the scenes the reality is rather different. The underlying driver of the Home Office’s enduring difficulties is that the views of our political, media and judicial establishments on crime and immigration are fundamentally at odds with those of the majority of the British people. The public want firm but fair control of immigration.In the case of the Windrush scandal, we expect a speedy and fair resolution for people who have long integrated into British life, whether they are technically citizens or not.It is time that all elements of the establishment grasped that control of immigration – the issue that determined the result of the Brexit referendum – really matters to the British public.Otto InglisEdinburgh• The Windrush generation are not the only immigrants who have fallen short of the increased hostility of the UK government to migrants. After I married a Japanese national in 1992, we moved to the UK. Within 12 months, she was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Similarly, in 1995 we returned to Japan for my work and I was soon granted indefinite leave to remain. However, when we came back to the UK in 2010 (in order for me to establish what has become a flourishing biotechnology company) the UK government’s attitude to foreigners had hardened to the extent that, despite 25 years of marriage, my wife still does not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK and we have paid thousands in exploitative visa fees and undergone numerous stressful tests.A British citizen should have the right to live with their long-term foreign spouse in either of their countries of birth. However, the government would rather hit its arbitrary immigration and deportation targets than see decent people treated decently.Michael JonesCEO, Cell Guidance SystemsRoyston, Hertfordshire• The elation among Labour party activists who helped bring down Amber Rudd will be short lived. It\u0026nbspwas obvious when the liberal media and Tory neoliberal globalists worked lock-step to ensure her resignation that the entire Windrush scandal was a well set up ploy designed to get rid of a home secretary who actually wanted to fulfil the wishes of the British public and control our borders, particularly after Brexit.Labour politicians will celebrate for now but in short order will face again the question of what immigration policy they will present to the public. They will be forced to explain why so many of them want continued open borders. Hopefully it will also become clear that the unknown number of Windrush deportees, plus all those Caribbean people now worrying about their citizenship status, were simply pawns in a much bigger game.Philip DuvalManchester• There is a correlation between the appalling treatment the Windrush generation has suffered and the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (Dubs children) promised safety and sanctuary but denied it by the Home Office. In May 2016 parliament voted to amend the immigration bill to allow some of the “most vulnerable” children already in Europe to come to the UK. But the implementation was at fault because this government did not honour parliament or our obligation as fellow humans.Earlier this month, Rudd said she was “worried the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”. Too right. These are children fleeing war with no adult to look out for them. They have no voice against the hostility of the UK towards immigration, and they need our help.Annabelle ZinovieffFaringdon, Oxfordshire • Green gone. Amber gone. Is the government at the crossroads?

Or rather, struck one familiar pose – the rather curious, legs-too-far-apart “power stance”.It has become a habit from leading Conservative politicians, dating back to 2015. George Osborne was the early adopter, photographed here after delivering his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester that year.The spread soon spread. Future prime minister Theresa May took her turn following her speech at the same conference. And then Michael Gove was spotted by  writer Michael Deacon, appearing backstage interviewed by the BBC, in the very same pose.A few months later, then prime minister David Cameron was also doing it – on live TV – for his doomed TV debate attempts to get the country to vote remain in the 2016 referendum.But where does it come from?Back in 2015 the  asked Dr Connson Locke, a leadership and organisational behaviour lecturer at LSE. After she stopped laughing at Osborne’s picture, she told Homa Khaleeli: “All I can think is that he got the advice that you should take up space to demonstrate confidence and he’s taken that to a weird extreme … It doesn’t mean standing with your feet so out of place that you look unnatural.”One possible source is Amy Cuddy. She did a very popular TEDTalk in 2012 that suggested that people adopting “high-power poses” for a couple of minutes a day lead to a measurable difference in how confidently they felt and acted. One of the poses she claimed had this effect is a Lynda Carter Wonder Woman-style pose, very similar to the one that the Tories keep making.Others suggested the influence might be from a beloved TV programme closer to home.With the political demise of Cameron and Osborne in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and May’s determination to put the remain-backing Conservative years behind the party, we thought the Tory power stance had disappeared.Could Javid’s resurrection of the pose be a coded message to backbench remainers?Meanwhile, with the news breaking late on Sunday night that Amber Rudd had resigned following the Windrush revelations, Labour MP David Lammy had a very different power stance in mind on his way to work on Monday morning.A vocal critic of both the prime minister and the ousted home secretary, Lammy used Twitter to suggest he’d entered the Houses of Parliament today with more than a little swagger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d16e1ba6b834ecadc07c18f4941923c889869af/0_89_3449_2069/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934733a6ee3fa133f0095074a9514184","title":"tories flounder in attempt to launch operation save theresa","story":"Amber Rudd made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her bossWith Operation Save Amber finally derailed after two weeks of fire-fighting the former home secretary’s failing memory – by the weekend she couldn’t even remember what targets she was meant to have forgotten – the Tory party’s attention turned to Operation Save Face. Aka Operation Save Theresa. With Amber Rudd out of a job, the prime minister has been left with no one else to take the blame for her hostile environment policy that caused the Windrush scandal.First out of the blocks on Radio 4’s Today programme was the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a zen master of never saying anything interesting. It took a while for Green to even admit that Rudd had been forced to resign and even then he restricted himself to a laconic: “She had to go.” Which made one wonder why he and so many other Conservatives had spent the previous week saying she had to stay.Next on the airwaves was Chris Grayling, which showed how much of a panic the government was in. The transport secretary is just about the only minister who makes David Davis look quick-witted and is the last person who should be sent out in a crisis.Sure enough, Grayling self-destructed in 10 seconds. After demonstrating he had no grasp of the situation by insisting a fourth cabinet resignation within six months was merely “unwanted noise”, he went on to say that May wouldn’t have known about the targets letter Rudd had sent her in 2017. After all, if the home secretary couldn’t remember writing the letter, then why on earth should the prime minister be expected to recall having read it? Over in Downing Street, May let out a shriek as Grayling inadvertently tried to get her the sack as well. The transport secretary pressed on. What it came down to was this: no one was really to blame for the Windrush debacle and Rudd was every bit as much a victim as the many thousands who had found themselves deprived of work and healthcare and threatened with deportation.More so, in fact. It had been a real advantage to have someone in charge of the Home Office who didn’t know what she was doing and it was a tragedy that she had resigned. Rudd’s tragedy was that she was just too good for this world. She had just made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her boss.Shortly after appointing Sajid Javid as her new home secretary, it was May’s turn to face the cameras. She looked and sounded terrible, as if she was featuring in a hostage video. Yes there had been targets when she had been home secretary, she mumbled, her eyes numb with terror. It was near enough a confession that she knew Rudd had misled parliament but hadn’t thought it important enough to mention to anyone. Amber could be very proud of her time as home secretary, she added. It’s not everyone who gets to preside over one of the department’s biggest failures in its history.Having posed with his legs thrust astride outside his new office – the department had needed a bit of manspreading to shake it up – Javid soon found himself inside the Commons to face his first urgent question as home secretary. Understandably, he chose to keep his opening remarks short and sweet. He was Windrush. Kiss the badge. Nobody cared about Windrush more than him and he would do whatever was necessary to put things right.Labour’s Diane Abbott wasn’t convinced. She had heard much the same from the last home secretary and what was required was actions not words. Would he reverse the 2014 immigration act and commit to making sure that no other Commonwealth citizens were treated in the same way?“She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger,” Javid snapped indignantly, before going on to show that he still hadn’t fully understood the nature of the problem by failing to acknowledge it had been the prime minister’s hostile environment policies that had resulted in British citizens being threatened with deportation.Several Labour MPs tried to put him right, but Javid wasn’t having any of it. He refused to recognise the term hostile environment. “It’s a compliant environment,” he protested. Compliant as in being as beastly as possible to anyone who looked foreign without being actively hostile. Words matter.Tory Nick Boles invited the new home secretary to distance himself from legacy policies that were fundamentally wrong. Sajid declined. He’d only just got the promotion and was not about to do anything that might get him sacked on the first day. He knew where his priorities lay. His job was to appear to be different. Not be different.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eabc48a25897572716803b7e780d29c6c251a43/0_89_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c1bfac09480f9dee88157d20ea5108","title":"woman with aspergers ejected from cinema for laughing at western","story":"Tamsin Parker, 25, was removed for laughing during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in LondonThe British Film Institute has apologised after staff forcibly removed a woman with Asperger syndrome from the cinema in what onlookers described as a “disgusting” sign of “naked intolerance”.Tamsin Parker, 25, an artist and animator, was watching a screening at the BFI’s cinema on London’s South Bank of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, directed by Sergio Leone – with two friends. She was asked to leave for laughing too loudly.Her mother added: “She was completely humiliated and it ruined her birthday.”The BFI released a statement saying it was sorry and had got it wrong in a “challenging and complex situation”.“We are taking this situation extremely seriously and this morning we have been investigating further ... We can and must do better in accommodating all the needs of our customers and we will be addressing what additional provisions and staff training we can put in place,” the institute said.Parker’s mother, who is speaking to a lawyer about what happened, said: “It would be nice to arrange a screening for Tamsin and her friends. The manager did not seem very apologetic at the time.” Parker was eager to see the BFI screening and has watched the film eight times, according to her mother, who went to collect her daughter after she was thrown out. “She was in floods of tears ... she was really scared,” her mother said.Lydia Parker, a theatre director, said it had been heartening to see messages of support on Twitter. The story has been shared widely on social media, with people voicing concern.One cinemagoer, Lloyd Shepherd, expressed his disgust after the incident. “She’d been laughing very loudly, but at moments which were supposed to be funny. Some people complained. She was dragged out shouting: ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s.’ She was incredibly upset,” he said.He said some people applauded her removal while others were upset, with a large number leaving.“I am shaking with anger. That poor, poor woman. Just a little bit of empathy and everything would have been fine. Such naked intolerance. In the middle of London. Disgusting,” Shepherd said.Parker’s sister, Sabrina Parker, tweeted that she had taken her sibling home to watch the rest of the movie. “Thank you for sharing this ... we’re horrified that they would treat her so badly,” she wrote. “Obviously she’s still very upset. It’s her favourite movie and it was her 25th birthday celebration.”The National Autistic Society said many autistic people felt venues were not autism-friendly enough, which is why it runs the autism friendly award to encourage businesses to be more accessible. The charity added that it works with cinemas and theatres to hold autism-friendly screenings.Jane Harris, the NAS’s director of external affairs, said the incident was shocking and a colleague was at the screening, “along with others who were equally distressed by what they had witnessed”.“It’s great to hear that so many audience members were sympathetic, but this incident shows just how far we have to go for autistic people to get the understanding they deserve,” she added.Harris said the NAS would be reaching out to the BFI to discuss ways to improve its staff members’ understanding of autism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3212429511c0d322731047eaeed54e2589471c/0_445_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce46de4b47eb1855c5723d4ba9b8fb04","title":"philippa york macho culture cyclists coming out","story":"Philippa York has suggested the macho culture in professional cycling is preventing riders from coming out as gay.York was King of the Mountains on the 1984 Tour de France while competing as Robert Millar and later disappeared from public life before transitioning to become a woman.It is 30 years since York struggled with gender dysphoria while still competing but she believes there is still an absence of a support system to allow an active rider to be openly homosexual. York was speaking before the Giro d’Italia which begins in Jerusalem on Friday, the first time the Grande Partenza – or start of the race – has been held outside Europe. There will be 175 riders competing for 22 teams and hundreds more backroom staff but York said her information was that none of them is openly gay.“There’s certainly no back up in any of the teams which would allow you to show any kind of gayness, anywhere on that gay spectrum,” she said.“It’s that whole macho culture of everybody’s straight white male and that’s it. The crazy thing is that the cycling model is set up by sponsorships, and those big sponsors, they’re usually big companies, they have a whole system of dealing with what I call the gay spectrum and they have no issue with it at all.“You can’t show any kind of weakness because, being gay, anywhere on that gay spectrum is seen as a weakness. In the macho world you can’t show that, because you’ll get more abuse from the side of the road than you get already.”York believes it will take at least a generation for the culture to change.“That is going to change when the young riders who are coming through school nowadays who get taught differently,” she said.The massive logistical operation of the Giro d’Italia was already under way on Monday with a Boeing 747 aircraft transporting the equipment, including several hundred bikes, to Israel. The race begins with a 9.7km time trial in Jerusalem on Friday.There will be two more stages in the country before the plane is loaded up again and flown the 2,000km to Sicily next Sunday when the Giro d’Italia transfers from Israel to Catania for the remainder of the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef0acab79cc76eea6572628cb9021f39d09892e/13_146_5157_3094/master/5157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d546719485da5360801e1d2f64f32f6f","title":"lewis hamilton mercedes ferrari sebastian vettel red bull f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton was absolutely honest after his unlikely victory in Baku. He knew he had inherited a win that with three laps to go was looking like a third place and a further deficit to Sebastian Vettel in the world championship. He came out of it on top and rightly did not opt to celebrate as he might have were it a harder won victory. He is four points ahead of Vettel but made it clear that relying on good fortune would not be enough in what is shaping up to be a highly contested season. The reality, Hamilton knows, is that with the exception of Melbourne, Mercedes have been unable to match Ferrari. The issue of unlocking performance from the car by working the tyres at the correct temperature is key and as things stand Ferrari do not face the same problem. How Mercedes fare at the next round in Barcelona, in a European climate similar to that we are likely to see at many summer meetings, will be telling. If they struggle at the Circuit de Catalunya it may be that far from last year’s a, this year they have created a monster.The stewards found both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen at fault for the accident that caused the crucial safety car in Azerbaijan. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, in public at least, said he held both drivers responsible and that both would be required to go to the factory in Milton Keynes and apologise to the workforce. Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko also blamed them both. “We let the drivers race and then they are doing that. Unbelievable. Both were wrong,” he said. Verstappen’s ill-advised moves against Hamilton and Vettel already this season have put him under more scrutiny than most but it is hard to ignore that moving as he did in Baku is always increasing the likelihood of contact. Red Bull do let their drivers race and until that moment it had been hugely entertaining. They insist they will continue to do so. It has proved costly but absolutely gripping for the sport. Let’s hope they stick to it.Azerbaijan is becoming a race of some import for the Monégasque rookie Charles Leclerc. Last year in Baku on his way to the F2 title, he won here just three days after the death of his father. An emotional weekend in which he wanted to deliver in his father’s honour. He repeated the feat this weekend. His sixth place in the Sauber was a magnificent drive and absolute confirmation of the exceptional promise he has previously displayed. The 20-year-old’s opening race weekends have been patchy at best as he comes to terms with an F1 car and his team do the same with a design that is completely new, conceptually brave and still in the process of being understood. However, on Sunday Leclerc looked absolutely in the groove, controlled, fluent and unafraid to attack. He described his first F1 points-scoring result as feeling like a win and with a few more performances like this Ferrari may consider promoting him to the Scuderia sooner rather than later.Vettel was insistent that he “had to try” his attempt to pass Bottas on the restart and from a psychological perspective, it is likely a claim as much to reassure himself as anyone else. But the move, which ultimately cost him an almost certain second place and potentially a win, could have been given greater consideration. There were three laps to go at that point, time still to close on Bottas and plan the overtake. Moreover, out of the pressure cooker of the restart he would likely have been able to take a calmer approach to it. Certainly Hamilton was harrying him on the restart but he could have gone defensive. Instead he committed to the attempt, did so clumsily and failed to pull it off. There were shades of the costly start in Singapore here, the bigger picture lost in a moment. Last season those moments were ultimately crucial in the championship he cannot afford to repeat them.Sergio Pérez’s third place was the culmination of a quite superb race. He had been hit by the Williams of Sergey Sirotkin on lap one, which pushed him into Kimi Räikkönen, breaking his front wing and requiring an immediate pit stop. He then took a five-second penalty at his second stop for a safety car line infringement. Yet he came back with remarkable resolve. Finally finding himself behind Vettel when the German flat-spotted his tyre on the final restart, Pérez spotted his chance and went for it, taking fourth. But he then had to hold the place – a huge task as Vettel came back at him. He did so brilliantly. “I had to give it everything in the last two laps,” he said. “My pace was unbelievable and I think they were the best two laps of my life.” His eighth podium is a new Mexican record, one more than Pedro Rodríguez scored with second place at the 1971 Dutch GP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a467a4da07dbc879f821b576b274e00f26122b1a/0_375_4093_2455/master/4093.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dccc8a0ec049777236edd19ce771e11","title":"frankie vah luke wright soho theatre london atiha sen gupta","story":"Delivered entirely in verse, Wright’s coming-of-age tale Frankie Vah is set in Thatcher’s Britain but the debate is as relevant as everWhat happens if you love your parents but loathe their politics? In Frankie Vah, the second verse play written and performed by Luke Wright, Frankie struggles to reconcile his father’s “Christian empathy” as a vicar with the fact that he puts a cross next to Margaret Thatcher’s name at the ballot box. Frankie abandons the vicarage for a life on the road as a radical left punk poet. The dog collar is traded in for a pair of DMs.Before the show begins, a spool of TV footage from the 1980s unfurls on the wall: flitting images of Spitting Image, Neil Kinnock falling into the sea and a post-Falklands Thatcher triumphant atop a tank. Frankie Vah is born Simon Mortimer in the life-sapping Dedham Vale (the part of Essex that John Constable used to paint). With his teenage years spent watching water mills, altar screens and ponds, our hero longs for university. There, he discovers himself both politically and poetically after chancing upon a gig by the Ranting Poets, “forged from punk and now at war in Thatcher’s Britain”. Deciding to become a performance poet, Mortimer metamorphoses into Frankie Vah less pen name, more nom-de-guerre. He finds love with fellow ally and artist Eve, flings his father’s faith back in his face, escapes to a “scabby flat” in London and joins a Red Wedge-inspired indie band on tour as a support act during the 1987 general election. Wright is a clever playwright and a charismatic performer he conjures minor characters to life with wit and verve in particular the boastful lisping Liverpudlian tour manager Petey. Delivered entirely in verse, Frankie flies between filling us in on where he’s at in life to performing his poems to the “paying” public we are cast as both his confidants and his audience. This creates an interesting tension particularly towards the end when his growing fame and self-destructive behaviour begin to unravel the persona he’s created for us. Throughout the piece, Frankie highlights how the left have to fight on two fronts – against not only Thatcher’s Tories but also against the centre of their own party. Debates rage on stage about the best way for Labour to gain the keys to Number 10 – how much principle should be lost for how much power gained? Times may have changed, but it seems the fundamental questions are eternal. Some argue that there’s no place for the political in plays – and I know of several playwrights who would reject that label – but drama and politics have much in common. They’re both fundamentally about a disruption to the status quo. Whereas most coming-of-age stories on the stage tend to focus solely on the personal, Frankie Vah is all the richer for its political and poetical layers. If the purpose of poetry is to make us bilingual in our own language, Wright succeeds in finding new and beautiful ways of expressing the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204/589_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6c91812e9a67782fce923bee7edeeb","title":"windows 10 april 2018 update microsoft task management cortana edge sharing","story":"Microsoft has released the latest version of Windows 10, adding improvements to task management, Cortana, Edge and sharingThe next version of Windows 10 is finally ready to download as a free update that adds some potentially game-changing new features as well as some welcome features that bring it up to par with what you might expect from a smartphone.Instead of adding tools for people creating media, as the previous two updates have, the latest version of Windows 10 is focused on time and task management.“We want to give you back some of your greatest currency, your time. Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group.That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense.It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community.Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out.The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that.In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release.That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading.The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off.As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS.Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing.Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate.Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking.Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added.Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements.Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568e7dc1d1f66c2ffc6dc97eaac1da6373bda7b6/0_0_6314_3788/master/6314.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ceede9edce61b13b110046a9e5c9a04","title":"art on the bbc the genius of leonardo da vinci","story":"Kenneth (Civilisation) Clark, Henry Moore and other ghosts from the BBC Archives bring us a bargain-basement portrait of the renaissance manJanina Ramirez, the art historian, is walking purposefully towards me, along a corridor. It has become a television bugbear for me, the “approach” approach to presenting, walk and talk. Like the – worse still – camera whirling around the head thing, AKA helicoptering. I mind less if the walk is connected to what they are saying, if they are pointing things out as they go. But Ramirez is talking about the Mona Lisa and she is not in the Louvre, she is in Blenheim Palace. It is walking for the sake of walking and I find it a little unsettling. Ramirez is great and has lots of interesting things to say. She makes me want to sit and listen, not feel as if I am walking backwards and\u0026nbspworrying about tripping over.While I am moaning, here is another little one that is specific to art on TV and also on show here: the slow pan over a work. You don’t look at a picture in a gallery like that, do you, unless you are drunk? You look at the whole thing, then you might focus on areas or details. And that is fine, if the camera zooms in for the expert to point something out or explain something. But the slow\u0026nbsppan is meaningless.Both of the above, I think, are about television’s fear of stillness. Everything has to keep moving or, they seem to think, people will get bored. There is a similar fear about a different kind of stillness – a lack of noise – which is why silence must be filled with music. But stillness – both kinds – can be powerful and make you sit\u0026nbspup and listen.Moan over. Ramirez is talking about Leonardo, his insatiable curiosity, his quest for knowledge and his use of light and shade. There is time spent on his technical innovation and his revolutionary anatomical research. In short: his genius. “Genius, genius, genius …” echo a chorus of critics and art historians and presenters from the ghost of television past. Ramirez’s journey takes her not just along the corridors of Blenheim, but also deep into the BBC archive, to see how television has influenced our understanding of the man and his work.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspkind of TV history of L da V.So here is Kenneth Clark in the seminal series Civilisation talking about that curiosity, and timelessness (see, Clark’s not walking, but sitting, and I am listening). And Robert Hughes bringing some antipodean early-70s cool, and excellent hair, to the table.And, most tantalisingly, Henry Moore from a 1978 Arena programme – caressing what seems to be the leg bone of a large animal, but may be one of his own creations – talking about Leonardo’s unending childlike quest for knowledge and his desire to share what he felt\u0026nbspabout life through his work. I would like to have seen more of that one, artist on artist that is the problem with this hooked-on-snippets approach.Here is reconstructed Leonardo (did Mark Rylance really need to do flickery candlelit recon?) in 2003. And Fiona Bruce on the search for lost works.

Illustration: iStockPeople who suffer from moderate to severe anxiety during middle age could be more likely to develop dementia in later life, researchers in the UK have found.An in-depth study of research into anxiety diagnosis has found that mid-life mental illnesses may be associated with dementia, with a gap of at least 10 years between the diagnoses.However, researchers could not determine whether active treatment, including non-drug therapies such as mindfulness and meditation, could curb the risk of developing the disease.The researchers trawled studies looking at the association between mid-life anxiety, in isolation or combined with depression, and the development of dementia. Only four out of more than 3,500 studies met these criteria, but they involved a total of nearly 30,000 people.Dementia is a term used to describe a number of conditions that cause damage to brain cells. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common and well-known cause of dementia and occurs when a build-up of protein on the brain forms plaques and tangles that stop the brain from working as it should. Vascular dementia is another common form of dementia and occurs when the blood supply to the brain is damaged.The study, which was published by the BMJ Open online medical journal on Monday night, follows recent evidence which revealed a link between anxiety and mild cognitive impairment, and is also connected to the known association between depression and dementia.Researchers note that abnormal levels of stress can speed up brain cell ageing and degenerative changes in the central nervous system and thus make people more vulnerable to developing dementia later in life.“Anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced in the years preceding a dementia diagnosis and have been associated with cognitive impairment,” write researchers from the University of Southampton and University College London. Whether reducing anxiety in middle age would result in a reduced risk of dementia “remains an open question”, they write.The study recommends that GPs consider anxiety as well as depression as an indicator of risk for dementia and that “close monitoring of subtle cognitive decline in older adults with a history of anxiety, depression and cerebrovascular disease (conditions that affect blood supply to the brain) would be encouraged”.Research into the benefits of treating anxiety without the use of drugs should also be investigated, notes the study. “Non-pharmacological therapies, including talking therapies and mindfulness-based interventions and meditation practices, that are known to reduce anxiety in midlife, could have a risk-reducing effect, although this is yet to be thoroughly researched.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Woman at centre of 2005 breast cancer misdiagnosis scandal says change neededSpokeswoman for Clinical Pathology Laboratories says it has \u0026lsquono comment at this time\u0026rsquoCabinet to discuss scope of Hiqa inquiry as well as possible redress schemeFears of prosecution for copyright infringement means few cases are reported, watchdog saysCourt of Appeal also significantly increases prison terms of offenders sentenced in lower courtsLabour Court finds woman discriminated against for dismissal on maternity leaveLegislation allowing for voluntary disclosure has not been brought into operationMore than 6,000 calls to CervicalCheck helpline, which one woman branded \u0026lsquouseless\u0026rsquoVaradkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutionsLiving within 500 metres of a pig lessens the likelihood of an allergy, according to researchersVegetarians tend to go through the menopause earlier than meat eaters, study findsAbnormal levels of stress in middle-age can speed up brain cell ageing, says studyCourt criticises HSE for permitting doctors work as consultants without being on specialist registerHealth service chief apologises for \u0026lsquocompletely unacceptable\u0026rsquo practicesCurrent reporting model needs to be reformed due to errors, Minister saysTony O\u0026rsquoBrien says he had no knowledge of Vicky Phelan case until he read about it in mediaTax will see price of some sugar-sweetened drinks rise 60c for a two-litre bottleGroup says move is \u0026lsquomost important\u0026rsquo step yet in fight against childhood obesity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479492.1525112611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier tries to calm politics around unresolved border issue","story":"Speaking in Dundalk during a two-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has urged rapid agreement by June on the scope of any British alignment with the single market.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to the Border again and crossed it but first had to deny that the “backstop” option for the post-Brexit frontier was an EU land grab for Northern Ireland.The suggestion, in a question from a journalist with the pro-Brexit Daily , shows the extent to which the political noise in London around the negotiations on Britain’s departure is making Barnier’s job so difficult.“We have no intention of questioning the UK’s constitutional order,” Barnier told the All-Island Civic Forum on Brexit in Dundalk. “This is none of our business.”Almost two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and less than a year until its departure, nobody is any clearer about what Brexit means for the Border – and the temperature around Brexit is still too high to figure it out.Barnier, on his second visit to the Border since Brexit, said this was exactly why he had come to visit both sides of the Border: to find “technical and practical solutions to assure safety controls” that protect the EU’s single market and, he suggested, the UK’s internal market too.“We have to de-dramatise this point to avoid any kind of ideology,” he said.“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the European Union being interested in a land grab,” stressed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, sharing a stage with Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The clock is ticking down to the next critical deadline in the Brexit negotiations, the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of June, and the issue of how to maintain an invisible border remains unresolved.So far, the only solution on the negotiating table is the backstop, the default position that will effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market.It is an option the UK has agreed to and conceded should be covered by a legal text in the Brexit treaty, but it does not want it and has so far failed to agree to the legal text or proposed an alternative acceptable to the EU.In an attempt to keep the pressure on the British to come up with other concrete proposals, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney displayed a unified line of offence here near the Border. The three were “absolutely united,” the Taoiseach said, in seeking “meaningful progress” by the June summit.Barnier suggested June was a “stepping stone” to October’s deadline for a final Brexit treaty but warned that until there was agreement on an operational backstop, there was “a risk” of a disorderly Brexit.He inadvertently had a dig at Davis when he took a question from a Northern Irish journalist about Davis believing the backstop wasn’t necessary.“Who?” he asked, not quite catching the Northern accent. The backstop was there not to change the UK’s red lines (leaving the EU single market and customs union), he replied, but “because of the UK’s red lines”.The heaviest punches were thrown by Opposition politicians during the forum’s plenary session.Labour leader Brendan Howlin referred to the “civil war” that had erupted in the UK Tory party over Brexit. Independent Alliance Minister Shane Ross suggested that England’s difficulty should be Ireland’s opportunity.“If they insist on imposing this self-inflicted wound, it is probably something that we can take advantage of,” he said, pointing to the opportunities for financial services and tourism.While Barnier wants no drama, no visit to the Border area by anyone so connected with Brexit could avoid it.Hours before his visit, DUP leader Arlene Foster questioned Barnier’s honesty as a broker. He was “not ready to engage in polemics,” Barnier replied, calmly.For some hard Brexiteers, they do not seem ready to move beyond them.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"project arts centre removes repeal mural","story":"  April 23, 2018Charities Regulator deems Maser mural on Project Arts Centre a \u0026lsquopolitical activity\u0026rsquo   April 24, 2018However, Varadkar says murals and posters will not convince people to change minds   April 27, 2018Maser\u0026rsquos mural was removed from side of the Project Arts Centre on Monday "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479500.1525112908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"with no sense of direction theresa may is the plaything of events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May arrives for a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Sale, near Manchester, on Monday as part of the Conservative Party’s local election campaign. Photograph: Oli ScarffPA WireFive years after her arrival in parliament, Amber Rudd was given the UK energy department to run. Her credentials for such a strategic role in a $2.9 trillion economy were her sound intellect and common sense. An unquantifiable hunch that she was doing well spurred her promotion to the Home Office a year later, where she had to master another wad of detail from scratch. On Sunday, she resigned over the mistreatment of the Windrush migrants, or rather a false statement about the policy behind it.The light-speed rise and fall, the intellectual generalism tested to destruction, the almost holy significance put on matters of communication: Rudd’s was the echt career in British politics. It could only be more typical of our public life if she returns to cabinet before long with another portfolio to wing her way through. Her replacement, Sajid Javid, who is running his fourth department in as many years, should be on his fifth by then.The British state is set up for low-key shambles. What permanence there is resides in a civil service that has interests, if not beliefs, of its own. Indeed, Conservatives wonder about the source of the leak that did for Rudd.A good prime minister can withstand these administrative fumbles and 10-a-penny resignations by espousing a central mission. Margaret Thatcher weathered crises as serious as the Westland affair because her quest for economic reform put them in perspective as transient news stories. Theresa May has no quest beyond Brexit and her own survival. There is little in the way of a domestic policy programme. Parliament is scrutinising such momentous legislation as the Civil Liability Bill, with its new measures against vexatious motor insurance claims. In the air is the kind of listlessness that attends the ninth year of a premiership. It is the second year of May’s.Having promised to stand for more than Brexit, the prime minister has managed to stand for less (given her constructive ambiguity on even that question). Her circumstances provide her with good excuses. Without a majority in either house of parliament, she cannot venture any contentious bills. Without the political capital to fire senior ministers, she cannot impose herself on government. While talks with the EU proceed, she cannot devote herself to anything else. Nor does her legislative inhibition have to be a problem for the nation. There are worse things than an inactive government, such as an active government. Savour this break from do-somethingism, the most righteous religion of our time, while it lasts.The problem is for May herself. With no sense of direction, she is the plaything of events. Each resignation – there have been five in six months – matters more than it should. Losses in the local elections this week would be no trouble to brush off for a prime minister with projects of their own to pursue. In May’s case, losses will renew gossip about her position.The Windrush scandal is traceable to decisions taken before Rudd’s time. Critics say that May’s own tenure at the Home Office is returning to dog her. They cannot know how right they are.The Home Office is a (necessarily) negative department. Its job is to stop bad things from happening, of which crime, terror and illegal immigration are the most serious. In her six years in that confoundingly avant garde building, May never had to create, only enforce. It is life-and-death work but inadequate preparation for Downing Street, to which parliament and the executive look for drive.There have been prime ministers of her reticent type before but they tend to be paired with a more dynamic chancellor of the exchequer. May has Philip Hammond, who compounds her own caution. The result is a government that avoids outright crisis in favour of ennui and drift. A very small mercy, that. May’s admirers still talk about her debut speech as prime minister as though Cicero is up there kicking himself for having been beaten to it. Even at the time, though, it was colour-by-numbers flannel about “burning injustice”, influenced by advisers who are no longer with her. She was never a seer. She was a conscientious, civic-minded politician who needs instructions to be getting on with.That was what Britain required in the summer of 2016, when zanier Tories were vying for power after the Brexit vote. But there are diminishing returns to mere diligence. Rudd’s departure would be a non-event for a busier prime minister. It matters to this one, but then so does every glancing blow. Britain can live without a governing vision. Whether May can is less clear. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

I\u0027m not happy. I want to die. It\u0027s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide, he added.Prof Goodall made headlines in 2016 when his university tried to force him from his role on the grounds that, at the age of 102, he was no longer fit to be on campus.Prof Goodall with Carol O\u0026#39Neill of Exit International, which advocates for voluntary euthanasiaAssisted suicide is illegal in most countries around the world and was banned in Australia until the state of Victoria became the first to legalise the practice last year.But that legislation, which takes effect from June 2019, only applies to terminally ill patients of sound mind and a life expectancy of less than six months.Other states in Australia have debated euthanasia in the past, but the proposals have always been defeated, mostly recently in New South Wales state last year.Exit International, which is helping Mr Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia\u0027s oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity.A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it.

Iran and other members of the P5+1 bloc of world powers have said it is not possible to renegotiate the agreement or strike a new pact.  Mr Netanyahu’s talk served as a counterweight to a furious diplomatic effort by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, who both visited the White House last week to implore Mr Trump not to scrap the agreement.  Con Coughlin: Israel\u0027s only aim is to persuade Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal - and it could workBritain supports remaining in the agreement and Theresa May spoke to both her German and French counterparts about the situation over the weekend. Mr Netanyahu said the files had already been shared with the US and that American intelligence “can vouch for its authenticity”. Israel plans to share it with other Western countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog.   Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, mocked Mr Netanyahu’s speech before it even began. “The boy who can\u0027t stop crying wolf is at it again,” Mr Zarif said. “You can only fool some of the people so many times.Mr Netanyahu said the 55,000 pages and 55,000 electronic documents had been secreted out of an archive in the Shorabad district of southern Tehran. “Few Iranians knew where it was, very few, and also a few Israelis,” he said. Mr Netanyahu said Israeli spies had pulled off one of their “biggest-ever intelligence achievements” by getting the files out of Tehran but gave no details about how they ended up in Israeli hands. The files  were from “Project Amad”, which Mr Netanyahu said was a secret Iranian programme to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s leaders have said consistently that they did not want a nuclear bomb and that their nuclear intentions were entirely peaceful.  Benjamin Netanyahu presents his evidenceProject Amad was shelved in 2003 but elements of it secretly continued and remain functional to this day under the direction of the same Iranian scientists who conducted the original research, Mr Netanyahu said. He charged that Iran had failed to “come clean” about its past nuclear activities in 2015, after the nuclear deal was signed, when Iran was required by the agreement to tell the IAEA about all its previous research. Iranian officials “denied the existence of a coordinated programme aimed at the development of a nuclear device and specifically denied the existence of the Amad Plan”, the IAEA wrote in its December 2015 assessment.   Mr Netanyahu said that Iran was preserving its nuclear knowhow, which could be applied again in 2026 when parts of the nuclear deal expire and Iran is allowed to return to largescale enrichment of uranium. Mr Netanyahu did not present evidence that Iran was currently violating the terms of the nuclear deal, for example by secretly enriching uranium now.The IAEA has said consistently that Iran is abiding by the terms of the agreement. since it went into force in January 2016. It last certified Iran’s compliance in February of this year. Senior US and Israeli military officers have also said in recent weeks that the Iran deal may be flawed but is achieving its central purpose of stopping Iranian progress towards a nuclear weapon. “Right now the agreement, with all its faults, is working and is putting off realisation of the Iranian nuclear vision by 10 to 15 years,” said General Gadi Eisenkot, the head of the Israeli military, in an interview on March 30.General Joseph Votel, the top US commander in the Middle East, said on March 14 that the deal “addresses one of the principle threats that we deal with from Iran”.The announcement was in character for Mr Netanyahu, who has a history of theatrical flourishes when it comes to announcements on Iran. During a speech before a security conference in Munich in February, the Israeli leader brandished a piece of an Iranian drone shot down by Israel’s air force. Six years ago, he brought a cartoon poster of a bomb to the United Nations as he warned against allowing Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump delays steel tariff decision for UK and other allies until JuneCardinal George Pell, Vatican treasurer, will stand trial on historical sex charges\u0026#39Jack the Ripper warning card\u0026#39 sells for £22,000 at auctionUK asthma death rates among the worst in EuropeTree crashes on to school softball game injuring 10 people in Pittsburgh suburbJohn Kelly denies calling Donald Trump an \u0026#39idiot\u0026#39 saying it is \u0026#39total BS\u0026#39Mindfulness could help to stave off dementia, research suggests Australia\u0026#39s oldest scientist, 104, plans to fly to Switzerland to end lifeSotheby\u0026#39s accused of misleading Sultan to pay £725,000 for sculptureThe Woman in White, episode 3 review: a gripping study of domestic abuseRed Cross urges public to sign up as terror attack responders after one of charity\u0026#39s busiest post-war yearsTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 Comment: Israel\u0026#39s only aim is to persuade Donald Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal - and it could workWhat the Sainsbury\u0026#39s-Asda deal means for shoppers?Comment: On Iran and Korea, Donald Trump\u0026#39s ambition is the same: to get the world to look after itselfCalls for Spain\u0026#39s justice minister to quit for questioning judge in \u0026#39wolfpack\u0026#39 rape trial Roses could smell sweeter and last for longer after scientists crack genetic codeComment: A wider conflict is coming to the Middle East unless Iran mends its waysComment: Sajid Javid v Diane Abbott: the battle beginsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000142792471_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqoy0UijBRPlBgfQSD9mX1zUYMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"roses could smell sweeter last longer scientists crack genetic","story":"Munstead Wood (Ausbernard) English Rose at David Austin RosesA rose by any other name would smell as sweet, so William Shakespeare’s Juliet famously declared.But a rose that has been genetically improved would smell even sweeter according to scientists who have cracked the DNA code of Britain’s favourite flower.Experts have created the first complete map of the popular flower, which they believe could help restore the heady scene that has dulled in recent years.Researchers said that by developing the blueprint - the first high-quality genome of the flower- they could engineer roses to be more fragrant, more colourful and longer lasting.Due to extensive cross-breeding, modern roses have complex DNA sequences that are difficult to reconstruct and previous attempts to fit together rose DNA molecules have resulted in fragmented and hard-to-read assemblages.But now they have found a way to edit the genes of roses, even if such bouquets are still a few years down the line.For the new work, researchers used advanced techniques to sequence the genome of the species Old Blush (Rosa chinensis). The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Donald Trump delays steel tariff decision for UK and other allies until JuneCardinal George Pell, Vatican treasurer, will stand trial on historical sex charges\u0026#39Jack the Ripper warning card\u0026#39 sells for £22,000 at auctionIsrael\u0026#39s Benjamin Netanyahu says he has \u0026#39conclusive proof\u0026#39 Iran lied about its nuclear weapons programmeUK asthma death rates among the worst in EuropeTree crashes on to school softball game injuring 10 people in Pittsburgh suburbJohn Kelly denies calling Donald Trump an \u0026#39idiot\u0026#39 saying it is \u0026#39total BS\u0026#39Mindfulness could help to stave off dementia, research suggests Australia\u0026#39s oldest scientist, 104, plans to fly to Switzerland to end lifeSotheby\u0026#39s accused of misleading Sultan to pay £725,000 for sculptureThe Woman in White, episode 3 review: a gripping study of domestic abuseRed Cross urges public to sign up as terror attack responders after one of charity\u0026#39s busiest post-war yearsTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 Comment: Israel\u0026#39s only aim is to persuade Donald Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal - and it could workWhat the Sainsbury\u0026#39s-Asda deal means for shoppers?Comment: On Iran and Korea, Donald Trump\u0026#39s ambition is the same: to get the world to look after itselfCalls for Spain\u0026#39s justice minister to quit for questioning judge in \u0026#39wolfpack\u0026#39 rape trial Comment: A wider conflict is coming to the Middle East unless Iran mends its waysComment: Sajid Javid v Diane Abbott: the battle beginsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161938198_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-fLBx2bsq5a1S3CGjPVQ4C9gK37-FtPvAMvEiDN4qaA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sothebys accused misleading sultan pay 725000 sculpture","story":"Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi has taken the auction house to courtAn Egyptian sculpture being sold through the mother of a Sotheby’s consultant has become the subject of a £725,000 court case, the  can reveal.The sculpture, Au Bord du Nil by Mahmoud Mokhtar, was sold in 2016 to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, who now claims he paid ten times over the odds for it after the date it was made was misrepresented in the auction house catalogue.In a High Court case, it has now emerged that the selling agent of the sculpture, art and antiques dealer Nesreen Farag, is related to a Sotheby’s consultant involved in the sale.The relationship, Al-Qassemi\u0027s legal representatives say, appears to be contrary to Sotheby’s Code of Business Conduct because it could have...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.The introduction does appear to be a test ahead of rolling it out on Facebook more broadly, however, and so the feature is expected to come to more people in the future.Facebook says that the button is for voting down comments that are abusive or disrespectful, so that they will not get promoted to the top of a discussion. As such, it mostly functions like the downvote button on Reddit, allowing people to express their dislike of a comment and offset any positive reactions it might be getting.MPs laugh at Facebook boss during intense grilling in parliamentIn doing so, the feature should be able to make conversations on the platform less centred around those comments that generate the most engagement – whether good or bad.Facebook has been struggling with how exactly to integrate a dislike button since at least 2015, when Mark Zuckerberg noted that not every moment is a good moment. He also noted that any feature would have to be carefully designed to avoid spreading negativity or to be used for bullying.To solve that, Facebook introduced its Reactions – allowing people to not only like something, but also to offer a range of other reactions, such as anger or laughter. But doing so introduced yet another problem: reacting angrily still counted as a reaction, and so content that made people upset was still being engaged with and promoted on the site.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It\u0027s clear that the government must develop a national alcohol strategy to address the harm they and their families face, and include treatment at its heart to reduce the suffering of the four in every five who currently do not access the services they need.This report shows very clearly what action is needed and we urge policy-makers, practitioners and service providers to join together to implement these recommendations to help the hundreds of thousands of people who are in desperate need of support.Press Association contributed to this report. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It also helps both humans and animals to navigate, and protects our telecommunication and satellite systems.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field foundIf the two magnetic poles were to switch places, something that has happened periodically over the course of Earth’s history, all of this would be compromised.Since 1840, the year scientists began to measure such things, the global strength of the Earth’s magnetic field has been declining at a rate of around 5 per cent per century.This weakening, combined with the expansion of a particularly weak area in the planet’s magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to speculation that Earth’s magnetic fields were about to\u0026nbspreverse.The last time such a “geomagnetic reversal” or “excursion” happened was 780,000 years ago, but coverage of this phenomenon has suggested such an\u0026nbspevent is right around the corner.\u0026nbspAn extract from a book by journalist Alanna Mitchell was published on the science website Undark.The book was titled The Spinning Magnet: The Electromagnetic Force That Created the Modern World — and Could Destroy It, and the extract included a warning that it was “time to wake up to the dangers and start preparing” for a magnetic pole reversal.This warning was picked up with gusto and soon many other articles were popping up warning of the dangers of an imminent pole reversal.However, the new study suggests the worst of these fears may have been unwarranted.Based on the Earth’s history of flipping its magnetic field, something which can be calculated based on magnetics minerals in rocks, they think such an event is unlikely to happen any time soon.“There has been speculation that we are about to experience a magnetic polar reversal or excursion,” said Professor Richard Holme, a geomagnetism expert at the University of Liverpool.Why the Earth’s magnetic poles could be about to swap places – and how“However, by studying the two most recent excursion events, we show that neither bear resemblance to current changes in the geomagnetic field and therefore it is probably unlikely that such an event is about to happen.Our research suggests instead that the current weakened field will recover without such an extreme event, and therefore is unlikely to reverse.Instead, the scientists predict it may take thousands of years before Earth’s magnetic field reverses again.Scientists are certainly aware of the possibility that the Earth’s magnetic field will flip its polarity at some point in the future. As Nasa states in a post on its website from 2011: “Reversals are the rule, not the exception”.In the Undark extract, Ms Mitchell quotes physicist Dr Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, Boulder saying he fears parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during such a reversal.However, the consensus still seems to be that even if such an event did take place, its outcomes would not be as serious as some commentators have made out:“Many doomsday theorists have tried to take this natural geological occurrence and suggest it could lead to Earth\u0027s destruction,” Nasa continued in their post.“But would there be any dramatic effects? The answer, from the geologic and fossil records we have from hundreds of past magnetic polarity reversals, seems to be \u0027no.\u0027”Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers.

The MEPs also warn that EU data protection rules need to be followed during the process, even after the UK has left.The letter comes after a visit to Brussels by Home Office officials last week, who tried to assuage MEPs’ concerns about the registration system.The Brexit coordinator Mr Verhofstadt said: “In a spirit of collaboration, MEPs have today set out a number of proposals in order to ensure the registration of EU citizens in the UK is dealt with in an efficient, flexible, timely and sensitive manner. In light of the Windrush scandal and given the large numbers of citizens affected, both the EU and the UK must work together to get this right.“It is important that the registration process should, as a matter of principle, be cost-free for applicants. It is unacceptable that citizens who were never consulted on Brexit should have to pay large fees to retain their own rights.“The registration system must be responsive, proportionate and cater for vulnerable groups and those who do not use digital devices.“We look forward to knowing more about how the independent authority overseeing the system will operate, what its competence will be and how its independence will be ensured.“It remains a priority for the European Parliament to ensure that citizens, whether the UK citizens in the EU or EU citizens in the UK, can continue to lead their lives as they do now.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But critics cast doubt on whether his words meant an actual change of approach.It was shortly after 10am on Monday that Downing Street announced Mr Javid would take charge of the Home Office from Ms Rudd, who quit amid a row about deportation targets and the Windrush scandal.Critics claim both issues are underpinned by the single-minded drive to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in the UK – instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary.Theresa May admits there were deportation targets when she was home secretaryWith Mr Javid forced to confront anger over the “hostile environment” approach in the Commons by 4pm, he said: “I don’t like the phrase hostile.“So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a country.”I don’t like the phrase hostile. So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a countryBefore quitting, Ms Rudd was reported to have been livid that she was dealing with the fallout of a broad approach to immigration implemented by Ms May.She was quick to tweet praise for Mr Javid’s opening comments on Monday, calling his appearance an “outstanding debut”.It will not have gone unnoticed in Downing Street that the new home secretary suggested language used by the prime minister for years does not reflect British “values”.He also risked provoking anger at Number 10 by saying he would review the use of “internal migration targets” at the Home Office, before deciding whether they should be kept – just hours after the prime minister gave an interview defending them.Boris Johnson clashes with Theresa May after demanding amnesty for all long-standing Commonwealth immigrantsMs May had said: “When I was home secretary we did have targets, targets for ensuring we were dealing with illegal immigrants.“I think if you ask any member of the public they will say that they do want government making sure that people who are here illegally are removed.”Asked whether Ms May wanted targets to continue at the Home Office later in the day, a Downing Street spokesman said it is up to the secretary of state to set “priorities”.It is not the first sign that Ms May’s Cabinet is challenging her long-established approach to immigration, with foreign secretary Boris Johnson recently reported to have called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have resided in the country for 10 years or more.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesSajid Javid outside the Home Office in Westminster after he was appointed as the new Home Secretary.

If you talk to members of the public, they want to be reassured that we are dealing with people who are here illegally.”The revelation will sharpen the focus on the role of the prime minister, the architect of the “hostile environment” policy that ended up persecuting the Windrush generation.Crucially, it is believed that any members of the Windrush generation detained for deportation – or prevented from returning to the UK – would have counted towards the now-revealed forced removal target.Jeremy Corbyn said: “Amber Rudd has been a human shield for Theresa May – and now she has gone.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

She was presiding over, in her terms, the creation of a hostile environment.”However, the prime minister’s spokesman said she no longer received internal briefings about the details of home office targets after leaving the post, in 2016.In the interview, Ms May also rejected suggestions that the departed home secretary had paid the price for her earlier policy decisions.“Amber Rudd was very clear about the reasons why she has resigned – that was because of information she gave to the House of Commons which was not correct,” the prime minister insisted.Amber Rudd’s resignation won’t take the heat off Theresa MayMay ‘pleading’ with EU for access to single market, says BarnierTheresa may suffers sixth defeat in a week in House of LordsMay vows her \u0027hostile environment\u0027 on illegal immigration will stayBrexit negotiators ‘gave EU power to freeze UK out of Galileo project\u0027“If you look at what we’re doing as a government, and have been doing over the years as a government, what we are doing is responding to the need that people see for a government to deal with illegal immigration. That’s exactly what we are doing.”Ms May said the Windrush generation had been “caught up in way that has caused anxiety”, but were now receiving help to secure the documents they needed.“We deal with that, we make sure that people are given the reassurance that they need, but we also need to ensure that we’re dealing with illegal immigration.” she vowed.The prime minister, on a visit to the Labour target borough of Trafford, also sought to scotch Conservative fears that the Windrush debacle will damage the party in Thursday’s local elections.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402623806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"katrice lee dig germany mysterious driver","story":"Katrice Lee, two, vanished from a NAAFI shopping centre in 1981 near a base in Paderborn where her soldier dad was stationed.A huge search operation was mounted involving the Royal Military Police, the German police, troops and volunteers, but she was never found.This week the RMP will begin a five-week forensic search of the bank of the River Alme at Paderborn - involving 100 soldiers.The site was identified  following the release of an age-progressed e-fit of a man seen at the NAAFI holding a child similar to Katrice.An e-fit has also been produced based on what Katrice is likely to look like now, aged 38 - including her unusual left eye.Senior Investigating Officer Warrant Officer Richard OLeary said: A team of military personnel and civilian forensic experts will be carrying out a detailed excavation of the site.The aim of the search is to find evidence that could finally shed light on what happened to Katrice.In February 2017 the case featured on BBC Crimewatch. As part of the feature a photofit was released of a man seen at the NAAFI on the day Katrice disappeared, holding a child similar to Katrice and getting into a green saloon car. We are keen to hear from anyone who could help to identify this person.A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car.The investigation team would also like to hear from anyone who was living in the Paderborn area who owned a green saloon car in 1981, so that they can be ruled out of the teams enquiries.Officer OLeary said: Thirty six years have passed and allegiances may have changed.We are appealing to members of the public and the military community, including veterans and retired civil servants in both Germany and the UK - do you know what happened to Katrice?She had been shopping for her second birthday tea treats with her mum Sharon at the Schloss Neuhaus NAAFI supermarket when she disappeared.The case, which has chilling similarities to season two of BBC drama The Missing, remains unsolved.Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was “gone in a matter of seconds”. She added: “It’s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.“Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn’t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.Fighting back tears, Sharon told The Sun: “Although I would like a fairytale ending to our story, I fully appreciate that might not be.“But at the end of the day, we will have closure and any emotions that come from that closure we will learn to live with and deal with as we have for the past nearly 37 years.“The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter’s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.“That’s another emotion we have to learn to live with.”Katrice’s dad Staff Sergeant Richard Lee, of the King’s Royal Hussars, was posted in West Germany at the height of the Cold War.On November 28, 1981, the NAAFI was rammed on the last payday before Christmas. Sharon said: “If you wanted English goodies, that was the time to get them.Katrice wouldn’t sit in the trolley, so I carried her all the way around in my arms doing my shopping.“When we got to the checkout I realised I’d forgotten crisps.“I put Katrice down and said to my sister Wendy, ‘Just keep an eye on her while I go back to the crisps stand’. It wasn’t far away. It took me about 40 seconds, a minute at most. When I got back I asked, ‘Where’s Katrice?’.“My sister said, ‘I thought she was with you. She ran and followed you’.“I went back down the aisle and she wasn’t there. Panic started to set in. I couldn’t see her anywhere. There was so many people. I was calling her name. Katrice couldn’t be found — she wasn’t there.”The Royal Military Police and German cops worked on the assumption the little girl — wearing red wellies, a turquoise duffle coat and tartan dress — wandered off, fell into another nearby river, the flooded Lippe, and drowned. But a hunt proved fruitless.Statements from shop staff were not taken for six weeks and details of an eye condition Katrice had were not released.The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012.Sharon, of Gosport, Hants, now divorced from Richard, is convinced Katrice was abducted. She said: “It’s my belief she left the NAAFI shop that morning, but she didn’t leave alone. I can’t believe — the NAAFI was so busy that morning — that a two-year-old walked out and disappeared off the face of the Earth and no one saw what happened.“I still have to go out and face the world and go about a daily routine but this situation never leaves you.“You can’t live with it 24/7. You have to push it to the back of your mind. But first thing in the morning and last thing at night, those are the times it gets to you.”Thanks to the family’s campaigning, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered extra resources for Operation Bute — the cold case probe run by a 28-strong RMP task force.Dad Richard, now 68, had criticised the RMP handling of the case, but felt his voice had “finally been heard” at a summit with Mr Williamson this year. He said: “Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.”As cops appeal again for information to help solve the case, Sharon added: “If people put themselves in my shoes for five minutes and feel how we have lived and felt for the past 36 years, then maybe those feelings would get them to come forward.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinets 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It stated: “This is very effective. Now you can go and steal as much as you can.”Another video told how to use magnets to beat tags.In February a shoplifter boasted he went on a stealing spree after watching a video tutorial on YouTube.Joseph Burwood, 22, targeted four stores at Clarks Village in Street, Somerset.

Scientists claim animal fats raise levels of the hormone oestrogen, which may impact fertility.Eating oily fish and beans was also found to delay the menopause by more than three years, thanks to their high levels of antioxidants.But insulin spikes triggered by consumption of refined carbohydrates like pasta are believed to speed up a woman’s periods and earlier menopause.Researcher Professor Janet Cade, from the School of Food Science and Nutrition at Leeds University, said: The age at which menopause begins can have serious health implications for some women.A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause. A higher intake of vitamin B6 and zinc also appeared to delay the onset.Women who suffer later menopause are more likely to develop breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, followed 14,172 Brit women for four years.More than 900 experienced the start of menopause during the research.Lead author Yashvee Dunneram, of the School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: This study is the first to investigate the links between individual nutrients and a wide variety of food groups and age at natural menopause in a large cohort of British women.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But then I couldn’t have imagined the abuse the elephants suffer.“Now I know, and I think everyone else needs to see this and know too.”Arthur is one of 50 elephants kept in pain and terror at an “elephant temple” in Guruvayur, in Kerala, South India.It is a popular destination for thousands of the more than 850,000 Brits who visit India each year.Evanna, who is also an avid animal rights campaigner, continued: “I have been so shocked. We saw one elephant chained up — it couldn’t move at all.“It had a stick resting on its head so if it moved the stick would fall. If it did the trainer would give it a beating.“I asked the man standing there how long the elephant might have been there, and he told me probably his whole life. That is unfathomable.”India’s elephants are snatched from their mothers in the wild when they are babies and taken to secret “training camps”. Here they are beaten, starved and tortured into complete submission in a process called “pajan”.The first step is for the beasts to be forced into a kraal or “crushing cage”.This is a wooden structure designed to keep the elephant so tightly caged it cannot move — not even to turn around, nod its head or sit down.Trainers then starve the animal and keep it awake for days on end.Exhausted and on the brink of death, the elephants are then beaten with wooden weapons, specially designed to inflict as much pain as possible.This happens every day for at least six months, but can go on for years.When finally their spirit is so broken that they let their trainers ride them, they are deemed safe enough to be rented out or sold to tourist attractions and temples across India.Nearly half of the elephants die from this abuse, and of those who survive to be sold, another ten per cent die within a year due to stress. But their suffering is a tourism goldmine.Elephants can be rented out for rides, festivals or to temples for anything from £34 to £1,600 a day — in a country where the average labourer only makes £10 a day.While much of the most violent training takes place out of sight of tourists, the brutal reality of elephants’ lives is far from hidden.When we arrive at Kerala’s Kochi airport a giant elephant statue welcomes us, complete with chains around its feet.Within half an hour of being on the road we are overtaken on a motorway by a rusty truck carrying an elephant tied down by chains, wires and rope. Seconds later another passes.They are being transported from camps across the country to one of India’s famous elephant festivals, Thrissur Pooram, in Thrissur, Kerala.We are on our way to the same event, where we find more than 90 elephants have been shipped in. They are dressed up and forced to stand in front of huge crowds while cannons fire and drums are banged for hours.With the help of our guide we gain access to a backstage holding pen for the animals, out of sight of visitors.In this dark, corrugated-iron structure the animals are heavily chained, unable to move or access water. Each has at least one trainer guarding it with sticks, and every animal looks terrified.Many have gaping wounds on their feet and backs — not a problem for the trainers who simply paint the wounds grey to cover up the injuries from the tourists.In order to discover more about what these beasts have been through, Evanna and I travel two hours north into deep forest to the village of Kodanad, where our guide tells us there is a training camp. After some careful negotiations with guards we manage to enter, posing as tourists who “just want to see the elephants”. Inside we see the terrible, stark reality of their lives.Chained to tree stumps, they are in appalling condition.Autoor is 16 years old and we find her swaying her head from side to side, over and over again — a sign of huge distress.It is impossible not to want to comfort her, but before we get too close a trainer approaches and whacks her with a stick, she immediately stops swaying, instead standing completely still.We quickly move on until we find a clearing in the forest. It is here we find the saddest of sights — a lone elephant locked in a crushing cage.The wooden cell stands so tall at first it is almost impossible to make out the elephant stuck inside.Then the trainers arrive and begin hitting and stabbing the elephant through the cage with large sticks.It is too much to bear and, with our guide getting increasingly anxious about our pictures being discovered, we quickly leave.I ask our guide, is this how all elephants are trained, or are some tamed more humanely?His response is chilling: “This is every single tourist elephant’s fate. The only reason they obey is with fear. They have been broken.”Duncan McNair, founder of charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE) is campaigning for a law banning UK holiday firms and tour companies advertising trips for these sorts of encounters with animals.He says: “Elephants are some of the most intelligent, emotional creatures in the world and the abuse they suffer is unimaginable.“Those horrors ensure the rest of their life is lived in fear.“I’m confident that if any tourist ever saw this, or even a small aspect of it, they would be appalled.”With tears in her eyes, Evanna said: “When people who have ridden elephants in the past or visited these places see this article, I don’t want them to feel guilty — they were misled by the irresponsible tourist industry.“What we need to do is to put that guilt into action and not visit these places in future.“I’d read a lot about the abuse elephants suffer but seeing it up close has given me the ability to speak from my heart and tell others that we can make a change by not spending our money and posting these tourist images.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evidence from health groups found that US companies are “particularly keen to gain access to the public health systems of Europe”.The International Trade committee recommends working across parties to achieve political consensus on its post-Brexit trade policy because trade deals are likely to take years to negotiate and could involve governments led by different parties over the coming years.SNP MP and chair of the International Trade committee Angus MacNeil said: “It would be a catastrophic error to rush into negotiations with the US without a comprehensive trade strategy.“The economic benefits of a US deal are presently unproven. The Government appears to be engaged in an exercise in doublethink: on the one hand telling us that new trade deals will be the pot of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow, while simultaneously saying it’s too soon to offer a realistic estimate of the possible contents or benefits a deal with its highest-priority target.”“Even in ideal circumstances, trade-offs will have to be made to get a comprehensive US deal. Without a trade strategy, we have no idea what these may be. Will the Government, in their rush to secure the future of the UK services sector, sacrifice UK agriculture or manufacturing? What does the Government intend to do to help industries if they are negatively affected by this bargain?“It was clear in our inquiry that questions about trade with the EU and with the US cannot be answered in isolation. Will the UK align its regulations with the US, and risk erecting impenetrable trade barriers with our other global partners, particularly the EU?If there is a clash between the regulatory regimes of the EU and the US, which does the Government plan to prioritise?

He went on to make millions, becoming the youngest vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank at 25.He became an MP in 2010, a junior Treasury minister in 2012, Culture Secretary in 2014 and Business Secretary in 2015.Yesterday he was already using the Tory power stance adopted by David Cameron and Mrs May.Mr Javid, 48, was summoned to replace Amber Rudd yesterday.She quit after admitting misleading MPs on deportation targets following the Windrush scandal.Mrs May yesterday defended the use of the targets as important.Mr Javid is the first ethnic MP to get one of the four top jobs in politics — PM, Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. And senior Tories say that puts him in prime position to take over at No10, uniting a party torn apart by Brexit.Mr Javid is said to be “on manoeuvres” for a future leadership bid. Bookies have already slashed the odds on him being the next PM from 66/1 to just 5/1.One minister told The Sun: “Sajid has been making noises for a little while about a leadership run, quietly asking a few of us what his chances would be and if we might support him.“The Home Office gives him a massive platform, and he already has an unbeatably good back story. I would be amazed if he doesn’t go for it when the time comes to move Theresa on, which will probably be next summer.”His appointment surprised many in Westminster, as Mr Javid and Mrs May have clashed in the past over migrant students.Aides said she promoted him because he is “a details man” with barrels of energy. A senior Downing Street figure said: “Being Home Secretary means you need a very sharp eye for detail and you have to be prepared to get your hands very dirty. If you look around the Cabinet, there aren’t many who fit that bill.”Addressing MPs, Mr Javid vowed to “do whatever it takes” to end the Windrush scandal, where ageing Caribbean migrants face wrongful deportation.Questioned over the need for a new Brexit immigration policy, he said: “Every department I’ve worked in I’ve almost certainly been putting on my own stamp.”Mr Javid hit out at taunts from Labour’s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who has Jamaican parents, saying: “I am a second generation migrant too. She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger.”He also rubbished the hostile environment mantra, used by Mrs May just last week to describe the policy of making it harder for illegals to prosper.Mr Javid said: “It’s not a phrase I’m going to use.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the application was eventually successful.Mr Brokenshire’s appointment as the new Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government comes just weeks after he had a cancerous tumour removed from his right lung.He quit as Northern Ireland Secretary in January ahead of the surgery.His embarrassing nimbyism came as housing groups piled on the pressure for Mr Brokenshire to get a grip of the “biggest housing emergency in decades”.Housing charity Shelter said: “With the lowest levels of social housebuilding since the second world war and rough sleeping is its highest for a decade, we hope the new Secretary of State will take the bold action needed to fix our broken housing market. We very much look forward to working with him to achieve this.”National Housing Federation chief David Orr said: “Genuinely affordable homes are desperately needed. Though housing associations are committed to delivering on the government’s rightly ambitious house-building targets, they urgently need government to make more affordable land available to achieve this.”Mr Brokenshire, 50, has been a close ally of the Prime Minister since serving under her from 2010-16 at the Home Office, where he was responsible for the crime prevention, security and immigration briefs.He led negotiations that secured the deportation of Islamist militant Abu Qatada in 2013 after an eight-year battle.The father-of-three was first appointed shadow minister for crime reduction by David Cameron in opposition in 2006.Born in Southend-on-Sea, Mr Brokenshire studied law at Exeter University and worked for 13 years at international law firm Jones Day, where he became a partner.He entered Parliament as MP for Hornchurch and Rainham in 2005, contesting his current seat at the next election after the constituency was abolished under boundary changes.Speaking shortly after his return to the Commons after cancer treatment, non-smoker Mr Brokenshire described how he was prompted to see his GP after coughing up a small amount of blood.“I trusted my instincts because deep down I knew something really wasn’t right,” he said.“I didn’t delay in going to see my GP, trusted his advice in seeing a consultant and followed things through.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
