He accepted some of a series of allegations against him, but denied all claims of intimidation.Ryan Donoghue told the tribunal: \u0027He was motivated by a different view on transgender rights. He felt so strongly that he was right that he saw it as his job to silence those on the other side of the debate\u0027.At times his behaviour could be described as \u0027sinister\u0027, he alleged.Overall, the tribunal found that his misconduct had impaired his fitness to practice. It suspended his registration for a month.Today\u0027s ruling said: \u0027The tribunal considered that Dr Harrop\u0027s actions in posting inappropriate tweets over a sustained period of time, in contradiction to the advice he was given, breached fundamental tenets of the profession.\u0027His actions brought the profession into disrepute, undermining public confidence in the profession and the standards of conduct expected from members of the profession\u0027.The tribunal added: \u0027Whilst Dr Harrop has a right to his views and to express them, the manner and thought processes he demonstrated raised concerns regarding the extent of his insight, and his inability to fully appreciate the wider context of his obligations as a doctor.\u0027In a written statement to the tribunal Dr Harrop said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for having fallen short of expectations, \u0027not only for myself but also because of the broader impact this may have had on the public\u0027s trust in my profession.\u0027I have taken meaningful and substantial steps to address the issues that have been highlighted and would like to assure the tribunal and the GMC that I will make every effort in the future not to repeat the same or similar errors of judgment.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Farewell face face GP appointments GPs burdens taken them","story":"Share this article\u0027What we are asking for a refocus of clinical priorities.

Officials advise Americans to avoid travel to these countries, and if travel to these countries is necessary, to make sure to be fully vaccinated before doing so. The bill, passed in the spring, includes among its targets critical race theory, or CRT, an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. CRT is rarely taught below college level but Republicans across the US have exploited fears about it for electoral gain. The Tennessee complaint was filed by Robin Steenman, chair of the Williamson county chapter of Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents group, the Tennesseean reported. The 11-page notice alleged that a literary curriculum, Wit and Wisdom, in use by Williamson county schools and at least 30 other districts, presented a “heavily biased agenda” that caused children to “hate their country, each other andor themselves”. The group took issue with several books adapted for younger readers on topics including King’s leadership of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the integration of schools in California by the activist Sylvia Mendez and the autobiography of Ruby Bridges, the first Black child to desegregate an all-white primary school in Louisiana. The Fox News host Sean Hannity has trailed an announcement from Oz in primetime tonight. Should Oz run, he would bring unrivaled name recognition and wealth to a race expected to among the nation’s most competitive and could determine control of the Senate next year. Oz became a household name after gaining fame as a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s show. He has also experienced controversy, notably when in 2015 a group of prominent American physicians called on Columbia University medical school to sever its links with Oz for “an egregious lack of integrity” over the promotion of “quack treatments” not supported by scientific evidence, “in the interest of personal financial gain”. In 2016 he hosted Donald Trump on his show. In 2018, Trump appointed him to a White House council on fitness.Lara Logan, a host on the Fox Nation streaming service, was discussing Omicron on Fox News Prime Time on Monday night. The news comes amid fears that the new Omicron variant will trigger a new wave of Covid cases and further deepen political isions in the US over how to respond to the pandemic. Fox News has consistently given a platform to misinformation about Covid and measures meant to contain it. “Josef Mengele earned his nickname by performing deadly and inhumane medical experiments on prisoners of the Holocaust including children,” the AJC said. “There is no comparing the hell these victims went through to public health measures. An apology is needed.” “If you are one of the 100m who are eligible for a booster, get a booster,” he said. “If you have kids, get them vaccinated.” “We have the tools and surveillance in place to identify the omicron variant,” Walensky said. “We also have the tools to prevent omicron from increasing the strain on our economy and healthcare system.”Fauci says at the moment, there is too much unknown about the new variant. While the mutations make it look it may be more transmissible than the Delta variant - which in itself was more transmissible than the original virus - Fauci said at the moment, “It’s difficult to infer.”  In terms of how effective the vaccines will be against the new variant, Fauci is still confident that the vaccine, with the added booster shots, will do a lot.  “As with other variants, although partial immune escape may occur, vaccines and in particular boosters give a level of antibody that, even with variants like Delta, give you a degree of cross-protection, particularly against severe disease,” Fauci said.  At the moment it’s still unknown if there are any unusual symptoms associated with the omicron variant. “But we do not know and it is too early to tell,” Fauci warned. Meadows had defied his deposition in front of the committee on November 12, which CNN is further reporting in its story today “suggested the next step was a showdown that could lead the panel to begin a criminal referral process against him.” Meadows’ lawyer George Terwilliger had indicated that there wouldn’t be cooperation until a court had decided whether Trump’s claims that executive privilege protects him from cooperating (with Meadows hoping for a similar shield by extension), a matter currently before the federal court in Washington, DC. Joe Biden won’t extend such privilege to Trump and observers think Trump’s on a long shot, here, but one that’s at least succeeding in gumming up the works. But CNN further reports that “the tone appeared to have shifted in recent days”. Many more subpoenas have been issued in recent days to iniduals whom the House panel wants to question and see materials from, relating principally to their conduct in the run-up to the insurrection and on the day. Those subpoenaed in the last week or feature so several Trump operatives, including Roger Stone and Alex Jones, and leaders of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups. Meanwhile, today  US reports that hours before the deadly attack on the US Capitol, Donald Trump made several calls from the White House to top lieutenants who were basing themselves at the Willard hotel in Washington. He talked about ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win from taking place on 6 January in Congress - an essential part of the American democratic process that was delayed by the insurrection but ultimately not thwarted.

Photograph: Getty ImagesI really want to become a vet. I’m studying biology and chemistry, as advised by my guidance counsellor, and volunteer locally with my local vet and pet rescue centre. However, there’s no chance I’ll score in the 600-point range to secure a place on the UCD course. Are there any other options? If your heart is set on becoming a veterinary surgeon, don’t lose hope. There are numerous routes available.Yes, securing one of the 82 places on offer in the only course in Ireland at UCD is very challenging given CAO entry points this year reached 601. Even without grade inflation, points were still high in 2019 (567 points) and under the calculated grades process in 2020 ( 587 points).Points look set to drop back somewhat in 2022, returning to a more normal results pattern arising from the traditional exams, but not I suspect to 2019 levels. This is because there will be over 10,000 applicants in this year’s CAO competition holding inflated points which they secured in 2020 and 2021.Alongside CAO points applicants must acquire at least 15 hours of practical animal handling experience between 1st February 2019 and 7th July 2022. (For full details and to complete your records of experience please visit: www.ucd.ieregistryadmissionsvet ).So, what alternatives are there? You could consider an application to one of the UK colleges through Ucas . Some new vet programmes have been added in recent years in Surrey, Nottingham, Aberystwyth in Wales, alongside the long-standing programmes. UK colleges tend to look for a H1 in both chemistry and biology and in either physics or higher level maths. Tuition fees are stg£9,250 per year.Another option is applying to programmes offered in Eastern European universities. Dr Tim O’ Leary, (timolearyvet@gmail) a veterinary surgeon in Schull in West Cork, has been for many years coordinating the application process for Irish students seeking places in the veterinary college in Budapest.He recently told me that, notwithstanding the excellent work of UCD in educating the next generation of Irish vets, there is still a strong demand at equine, farm and small animal practice levels for graduates of other EU programmes.Entry requirements for Budapest are based on a short exam in May in biology and chemistry in Dublin, and a brief interview to determine suitability.Guy Flouch, founder Eunicas.ie, has also facilitated Irish students in securing places in veterinary programmes in a number of Polish universities including Warsaw, as well as in the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.Fees for all these Eastern European programmes can vary from €8,000-€12,000, depending on location. While it is expensive, accommodation in Warsaw or Budapest for shared apartments can be had for as little as €150-200 per month.My advice? Focus on your studies and see what your Leaving Cert produces next August. But as a form of insurance, consider applying to veterinary programmes abroad.Do you have an education query?

No self-adminisitered tests will be accepted, under rules considered by cabinet. Those with a PCR test result will have a longer pre-travel window of 72 hours.Persons arriving into the State from overseas who have been vaccinated or recovered from Covid19 will be required also to have a certified negative test.The specifics were strongly criticised on Tuesday afternoon in a series of social media positings by the UCD virologist, Dr Gerald Barry.“Using a once off antigen tests like this to stop SARS-CoV-2 coming into Ireland, is scientifically unsound, and whoever came up with it should have a serious look at themselves,” he said on twitter. “I am actually embarrassed for whoever thought this would be a good idea.“PCR is better in this circumstance, but 72 hours is too long. Shorten that and require it on the other side too. Consider false negatives as well as the chance of infection in the interim. Has nothing been learned?? This is all just fluff to look like something is being done.”The Cabinet on Tuesday also endorsed National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) recommendations that children aged nine and over wear masks in school and reduce indoor socialising.The Government did not make wearing masks for children a legal requirements, instead leaving them as recommendation to schools and parents, while asking them to curtail their children’s contacts. In general, the advice for children will be the same as for adults to reduce socialising.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly expressed relief at the latest Nphet figures which indicate that the efforts of the public have made a difference.Sobering modellingThe latest Nphet figures showed what the situation was now compared with the “sobering modelling forecasts” of two weeks ago, he said. “I’m delighted to be able to say that we can really see the impact of the efforts that people are making.”The Minister also said he hoped that following this morning’s meeting there would be “very clear guidance” on mask wearing in schools and that there would be “very clear advice” for parents.The analysis from Nphet showed that case numbers were particularly high in nine, 10 and 11 year olds, he said. This was the reason for the recommendation for children to wear masks in primary schools from third class up, he explained.Nphet reported yesterday that there were 4,607 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 579 hospitalised, of which 115 are in ICU.The Government will introduce two pieces of emergency legislation to the Oireachtas this week to deal with the latest surge in Covid-19 with case numbers and hospitalisations remaining high. A Bill to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine will be brought to the Dáil on Thursday. The Government has told Opposition parties it expects the Bill to pass all stages and has also said the debate will be subject to quarantine. On Friday, the Health and Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill will come before the Dáil. This Bill will extend the Covid emergency powers where the Minister for Health is allowed to make regulations without recourse to parliament. Most opposition parties will not oppose this Bill but will seek amendments. However, Sinn Féin on Tuesday said it would oppose the Bill, as it has opposed earlier extensions. “We have reservations about that Bill particularly in relation to the competence of Minister (for Health) Stephen Donnelly,” said the party’s health spokesman David Cullinane. “We are not in the mood to give this Minister for Health any blank cheques in relation to introduce ing regulations where there is no accountability or oversight or debate.”Hotel quarantineHe accused Mr Donnelly of making “a dog’s dinner” out of many (regulations). The reintroduction of mandatory hotel quarantine has been on the Government’s agenda since the identification of a new highly transmissible variant of Covid-19 in South Africa last week. The legislation is in specific response to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Speaking at Leinster House on Tuesday, Mr Cullinane said his party would nevertheless support the advice from Government for children, saying he agreed it should be advisory not mandatory. “It’s a sensible approach as long as the appropriate supports are put in place for business who will face consequences,” he said. “My view is that most of the people have abided by most of the advice most of the tie and that has put us in a strong position.”However, in separate media interviews, Mr Cullinane and Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall both condemned what they described as Mr Donnelly’s ‘U-turn’ on free or subsidised antigen tests. Calling for free antigen tests, Mr Cullinane said: “It might be okay for some of us on decent salaries. If there is a family with five or six nd they all have to take three antigen tests over a five-day period.”Asked what controls could be put in place to ensure that the cost to the State of free antigen tests did not spiral out of control as they did in Britain, Mr Cullinane said the infrastructure and ability was there to ensure that. He also aid people should be trusted to do what is right. Ms Shortall said the decision not to subsidise antigen tests was a “big mistake and does not make sense on any fronts”. SubsidiseShe said the Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Donnelly had promised to subsidise antigens tests.“The Government should not be leaving this important tool to the vagaries of the market. It’s important that the Government ensures certainty of supply and (that) the quality is good.”“A family of four using it twice a week. That amounts to €30 a week which is a sizable amount of money.”On the Janssen single-shot vaccine which was given to many people aged between 18 and 24 last summer, she said it was now known it waned very quickly and its efficacy was down to 13 per cent after nine months. “For that reason priority needs to be given to that cohort between 18 and 34 who got the Janssen vaccine and are in the main out socialising and mixing most as young people do.”She said there was no doubt that children are paying a big price at the moment and criticised inconsistencies in the rules. “On the one hand you have rugby matches with 50,000 people and at the same time you are saying to children, you can’t go on a playdate. There is an imbalance there.”Speaking on his way into Cabinet, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that parents will make the “judgement calls” on reducing socialisation for their children. He said: “It’s not a strict no on any one thing. It’s just saying do what we’re doing well.”In remarks reported by RTÉ he said that Covid numbers are leveling and the advice for children will be “the same as adults, restrict socialisation”.He said parents will be the judge on that and how to protect their family’s health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"masks for schoolchildren nine and over set to be recommended","story":"The Cabinet is likely to endorse National Public Health Emergency Team recommendations that children aged nine and over wear masks when in school.

However, one source suggested the advice to parents could be that if they were considering both activities for their children in the same week they should only do one.In general, the advice for children will be the same as for adults to reduce socialising.Variant threatThe leaders of the Government parties and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly were briefed by senior Nphet figures including chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Monday evening on the current situation and on the emerging threat from the new variant.Mr Donnelly said it was likely Omicron was here and that 11 cases were being examined for possible signs of the new variant. However, officials said that while results of those tests would be available in the coming days, it would be two to three weeks before it was clear what exactly was the nature of the threat posed by the new variant.A Government source said there were some indications that the new variant could turn out to be more transmissible but less severe than the Delta variant.Countries all over Europe have tightened restrictions on people travelling from southern Africa, where the new variant was first confirmed, while cases have been identified in several EU countries since the weekend.Here it is understood that legislation to revive mandatory hotel quarantine – which was in place earlier this year but which has lapsed from the statute books – will be rushed through the Dáil this week, if the Cabinet approves on Tuesday.Antigen testsHowever, while Ministers are keen to move quickly to delay the spread of the new variant here, there is far more reluctance to introduce new restrictions on social and economic life to cope with the existing fourth wave.On Monday, the Government confirmed it had abandoned plans to subsidise antigen tests due to the fact that average prices in supermarkets had dropped to about €3 per test.Mr Donnelly called this a “good result” as it would save the taxpayer having to subsidise such testing.It is understood that, at a meeting between senior officials and representatives of retailers last week, supermarkets committed to providing the tests at about the same price as subsidised tests would have been sold at pharmacies.“It just didn’t make any sense,” one source said after discussions between senior health officials and the Department of the Taoiseach, and the plan was dropped. However, Ministers were not told, and they continued to insist that the subsidy plan would go ahead in recent days.The move has been criticised by opposition politicians. The Social Democrats co-leader, Róisín Shortall, claimed the scrapping of the scheme was a “dereliction of duty”, saying it meant the Government would have “no role in their pricing, availability, accessibility or quality control”.Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane accused the Government of “penny-pinching” and reiterated calls for antigen tests to be made freely available, saying the “rollback” on a subsidy was “deeply disappointing”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what are the new covid measures on children s activities and travel","story":"Nphet advised the Government that indoor community gatherings should be avoided for children aged 12 and younger for the next two weeks. Photograph: iStock The Cabinet on Tuesday agreed a raft of new measures for schools, children’s activities and travel. But what are they, when do they take effect, and how will they be enforced? ChildrenWhat’s the latest on masks in schools?Previously, masks have been a requirement for children in post-primary, and staff in both primary and secondary schools. From now on this will be a requirement for all children from third class and up. This is not a requirement in law but it is a requirement in schools on public-health grounds. A guidance document based on advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is being circulated to schools, and the requirement comes into effect on Wednesday.Schools will be encouraged to show flexibility in the coming days, and there are exemptions on medical grounds. However, children would be refused entry to school if a medical cert exempting them from masking up is sought but not provided. The requirement extends to school transport, also from Wednesday. What about mask-wearing for children in other settings? There is a legal obligation for everyone aged 13 and above to wear face coverings on public transport and in certain other settings such as shops, libraries, cinemas, theatres, museums, airports and other indoor settings where people mix from different households.The Government has now made a decision to recommend face masks and coverings for children aged nine and above in the same settings. This will only be public health advice, not a legal requirement. This will be reviewed in mid-February 2022.What is the advice around children’s activities?The National Public Health Emergency Team advised the Government that indoor community gatherings should be avoided for children aged 12 and younger for the next two weeks, including nativity plays, sleepovers, indoor birthday parties and playdates.There are no guidelines, regulations or laws being signed or created around this, with the Government instead doubling down on asking that existing public-health advice to limit contacts be observed. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said before Cabinet that parents are being advised to make the “judgment calls” on reducing socialisation for their children. “It’s not a strict ‘no’ on any one thing. It’s just saying do what we’re doing well,”, and that the advice for children will be “the same as adults: restrict socialisation”.In a statement, the Government said parents should aim to reduce socialisation indoors in respect of children aged 12 and younger over the next two weeks. Because there is no policy change, as such, there is no issue of enforcement but there is an emphasis on people observing the advice for the next fortnight. TravelWill mandatory hotel quarantine (MHQ) make a comeback?The old MHQ system that was so controversial during the summer has not been reintroduced. Cabinet took a decision on Tuesday to pass legislation putting it back on a statutory footing, which would give the Government the option to legally reintroduce it if it so chooses – but no decision has been made yet on whether it will. If it does, it is not clear what the role or function of such a system would be yet, including whether it would be as extensive as earlier this year. Travel restrictions put in place on Tuesday and last Friday focus on testing and home quarantine.The aim is to reintroduce the MHQ legislation this week. What about home quarantine guidelines?As of last Friday, there is a requirement on people arriving into the State with a travel history associated with seven southern African countries where the Omicron variant has been detected to quarantine at home for 10 days. People in their households must also restrict their movements. People arriving from these countries must present a clear PCR test on arrival, and must take two PCR tests while in home quarantine – on day two and day eight. No countries were added to this list by the Government on Tuesday, despite the variant being identified in many countries, including within the European Union, since then. More countries may be added, and coalition sources indicate such a step would be based either on advice from Nphet or in step with the rest of the European Union. This is a regulation which was signed into force over last weekend. What are the new Covid testing requirements for international travel?Arising from a decision taken at Cabinet on Tuesday, all people arriving into the State must present a “not-detected” Covid-19 test. This will be a regulation, and the statutory instrument giving it legal effect will be in place by Friday, when the requirement kicks in. Children aged 11 and younger are not subject to the testing requirement. Both PCR tests (taken up to 72 hours pre-departure) and professionally-administered antigen tests (taken up to 48 hours pre-departure) are acceptable. Compliance will be checked by airlines and ferry companies.

The Cabinet agreed to a scheme where 100 per cent redress will be available to affected homes up to a limit of €420,000 per home.Earlier this month Donegal TD Joe McHugh said he would “consider all options” including the possibility of quitting Fine Gael if the scheme did not meet the expectations of affected homeowners. He gave the scheme a “cautious welcome” on Tuesday. Other Government TDs who had back the homeowners’ demands also welcomed the measures.Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue, a Fianna Fáil Donegal TD, described it as a “strong overall scheme” that will satisfy the demands of the campaign groups and “stand the test of time”.His party colleague, Mayo TD Dara Calleary welcomed “significant progress” on the scheme highlighting the “fall in the entry costs, the 100 per cent commitment” and the inclusion of rental properties and mental health supports. In the Dáil, Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said families affected by the Mica scandal “shouldn’t be left to fend for themselves” and it must be ensured that the redress scheme is “fit for purpose”. Mr Doherty said the families involved are “going through a terrible situation”. The Donegal TD said as details of the scheme emerged many families would be facing a shortfall of between €45,000 and €56,000 in rebuilding costs. “These campaigners won the hearts and minds of the Irish nation,” Mr Doherty said. “This is a scandal that has devastated the lives of ordinary families and it’s a direct consequence of the Celtic Tiger era, an era of no regulation and light touch regulation.”His party colleague Pádraig Mac Lochlainn claimed that Mica impacted homeowners are not getting the same level of assistance as those who were helped under the Pyrite Resolution Scheme in Leinster. “Why are families in the west of Ireland being asked to fend for themselves and forced to negotiate prices with building contractors in a market with steep rising prices?” he asked.Independent TD Thomas Pringle said affected families in Donegal were facing “the same again” and that they “can’t afford this scheme and they couldn’t afford the last scheme”.He said the new proposals were “an advance – but they do not go far enough.”‘We need to rebuild’Taoiseach Micheál Martin urged affected homeowners to accept the new plan and said the level of State intervention was “unprecedented”. He said the scheme was “a substantial contribution by taxpayers and the Exchequer to any housing remediation scheme”.“I have no issue with sorting this out and helping families to rebuild their homes. I have been in houses where I have seen how devastating this is for families. We need to rebuild these houses, but we need to get on with it and get it done,” he said. “I have been in Government for about 18 months. This has been going on for years … We can have more and more campaigns, but nothing gets done in the meantime. We can get the scheme up and running.”He said the Housing Agency will play a “central role” in helping homeowners. “This level of State intervention is unprecedented. It has never happened previously at the level it is happening now. It is because it is a social priority,” he added. However, Mica action group spokesman Michael Doherty told RTÉ’s News at One that the scheme “discriminates against bigger houses” due to the €420,000 cap and the per-square-foot allowable cost which drops after the first 1,000 square feet.“That has a massive implication. We know that the average size house is between 2,300 and 2,400 square feet if you’ve got €145 for the first 1,000 square feet, the biggest part of your house is on a sliding scale, not the smallest part and that’s not something we can accept.“It reinforces the situation we face time and time again, we get a headline, and then we get the devil in the details which detracts from it somewhat which is extremely unfortunate,” Mr Doherty said."},{"url":null,"title":"government agrees to 2 2bn mica redress scheme","story":"Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is expected to hold a press conference at lunchtime on Tuesday formally announcing the scheme. Photograph: Alan Betson The Government has agreed to finance a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild and remediate an estimated 7,500 homes which have been structurally damaged by mica.The Cabinet agreed to a scheme where 100 per cent redress will be available to affected homes up to a limit of €420,000 per home.Crucially, the per-square-foot allowable cost has also been increased upwards in the past 24 hours from €138 top €145 for the first 1,000 square feet, with a commitment from the Government that the scheme will take inflation into account, and the per-foot cost will be reviewed every year.That issue in particular had proved to be contentious with campaign groups saying the €138 per square foot figure was inadequate in the light of sharp inflation in the construction industry over the past year.It is estimated that 7,500 homes in Donegal and Mayo have been damaged by the presence of mica in blocks used for their construction. However, there are households in other counties - including Clare and Tipperary - who have also been affected, but not all of whom have come forward yet.At a press conference following the Cabinet meeting, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien outlined details of the scheme. He said the overall cost of the scheme had been almost tripled from over €800,000 to €2.2 billion with the maximum allowable amount increased from €247,000 to €420,000.He also said that homeowners who had to move out of their homes during renovation would be entitled to a maximum of €15,000 to pay for alternative accommodation as well as €5,000 for storage.He said that a new independent appeals process will be introduced and that second homes or rented homes would be eligible once they were registered with the Rent Tenancy Board.He said that primary legislation would be required to introduce the scheme and that a review would also be taken by a senior counsel into the role of industry and regulation in contributing to the crisis. A review will also take place into latent defects insurance as well as a process to ensure that concrete blocks standards were of the highest level.“Our commitment is to establish a building standards regulatory authority on a statutory basis,” added Mr O’Brien.The Minister said this scheme would ensure that homeowners affected by mica would have parity with homeowners whose homes were damaged by Pyrite.“This issue has been raised regularly with me in relation to the east coast and the west coast,” he said.“This newly enhanced scheme ensures absolute parity of treatment for the north west coast and east coast and in some instances goes further.“Those impacted can rebuild their homes and more importantly they can rebuild their lives that have been so badly impacted,” he said.Mr O’Brien said that 7,500 homes were affected, 1,000 of which were social homes. He said it had taken nine years to remediate 2,600 homes affected by Pyrite.“The scale of this work should not be underestimated. There is a capacity issue as well,” he said.The Housing Agency said that once a home has met the damage threshold for entry to the scheme, it will assist homeowners by employing engineers to undertake the testing and assessment of their homes.This, the agency said, will ensure the most appropriate remediation option is recommended for each home. “The agency’s role should also help to improve the current lead-in time on the approval of grants and ultimately speed up the remediation of affected homes,” it said.‘Extremely unfortunate’Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said he welcomed the scheme describing it as a “strong overall scheme” that will satisfy the demands of the campaign groups.The Donegal TD said the sliding scale of €145 for the first 1,000 square feet, €110 for the next 1,000, and €100 for the remainder was an extrapolation from the average of €138 per square foot.“Overall this is a very strong scheme, one that can support families to remediate their homes and one which will stand the test of time,” he said.Mr McConalogue was one of three Government TDs - along with Dara Calleary in Mayo, and Joe McHugh in Donegal - who had supported the demands of campaign groups.Spokesperson for the mica action group Michael Doherty told RTÉ’s News at One that the scheme “discriminates against bigger houses” due to the €420,000 cap and the per-square-foot allowable cost which drops after the first 1,000 square feet.“That has a massive implication.

Advent calendars waiting on mantelpieces. The jingle-jangle of sleigh bells on an endless muzak loop. A portly man promising a season of goodwill only for a grisly Covid variant to change everything and No 10’s advice to slip from ho-ho-ho to no-no-no. The crackdown’s first edict is already here. Today, like some unwelcome rehash of a movie you didn’t like the first time round, is Mask Day 2. At 4am today, the new regime dawned, replacing the do-as-you-see-fit attitude that followed “Freedom Day” on July 19 with an order to mask up in shops and on public transport. It had to be masks. There are a host of so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) able to dent Covid, from handwashing and work-from-home directives to full national lockdown. But, of all the options on the menu, none is so isive in Britain as the wearing of masks. None polarises us more, setting very British attitudes at odds with each other: the deferential queue observer against the authority questioner the selfless, polite personality against the robust, self-reliant inidual. It is as though our island’s character has been resolved into contradictions. Indeed on this issue the Union is indeed ided, with different rules in its four constituent parts. Today’s promise is that those who don’t comply will be walloped with a series of £200 fines, which double with each reoffence. But anyone who has seen “enforcement” on the London Underground – where staff themselves wear masks around their chins as canned messages demand passengers muffle up – will know this is likely to be a charade. Instead we must prepare ourselves for the return of that ultimate in British authority: the tutting and eye-rolling of social disapproval. What official force can compare? Other countries may endure anti-lockdown riots directed at the state, but Britain does it differently. From today, my friends, it is not us against them, but us against us as, with pursed lips or defiant stares, we once again begin to police ourselves.Who knows why this devolution of enforcement to the inidual is particular to Britain, but it is. Take a trip to France and you discover a host of measures that seem sensible there but unimaginable here. Want to get on the train? You need a mask and proof of vaccine. Two centuries of statist edicts from the centre make such rules unremarkable. And as for the draconian rules of Spain, or Greece, well it’s easy to forget that both were Right-wing military dictatorships within the last half century. Whereas we, in sometimes self-congratulating style, do cherish the whole Mother of Parliaments bit. And that Parliament is led by a man whose every fibre rebels against the nanny state, even if the pandemic might demand, from time to time, a dose of unpleasant nannying. From the very beginning, the experts at Sage’s behavioural insight subcommittee (Spi-B) were clear that, if the country was not to dissolve in bitter acrimony over masks, strong leadership would be required. “If government is to recommend that the public wear face masks in the community,” it noted on April 20 2020, a month into lockdown one, “there will need to be thorough guidance and communication.” Without it, we would have “heightened public awareness, negative evaluation and harassment of people who are not wearing face masks, leading to ision which could undermine collective solidarity which is helpful for managing the pandemic.”Instead of such clear guidance and communication, however, there was fudge. To begin with, that was not unusual. After all, at the beginning of the pandemic even the WHO considered there was insufficient evidence that masks reduced transmission. But that was when droplets from coughs and surface contact were considered the two main vectors, and the dangers of aerosols – particles hanging around in the air for ages – were largely unrecognised. On May 11 the first recommendations were made in England: the Government advised the use of a face coverings, but only in enclosed spaces, where social distancing was difficult. A month later, they became mandatory on public transport. A month after that, in shops, too. Such off-on requirements were off again this summer, but the ambiguity remained as official advice stated that “you are expected and recommended to continue wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces ... where the risk of transmission is likely to be greater.” Yet as we all know, Tory MPs on the Government benches have almost all abandoned masks, while Labour seem to have a three-line whip enforcing them. Professor Robert West, a psychologist on Spi-B, has warned how confusing this all can be. “People who are ambivalent, it gives them a kind of excuse to say, ‘If they’re not doing it why should I do it?’” The PM, however, prefers nudge to nanny-state. “Nudging” can be highly effective and has certainly informed the decision to market masks as a tool to protect others, as much as (if not more than) to protect oneself. Psychological studies suggest we like people more after doing something nice for them. Social cohesiveness is built on the giving and receiving of favours – like wearing a mask to protect them. As Spi-B noted as long ago as April 2020: “Wearing a face mask could demonstrate that an inidual is concerned for other people’s welfare and is enacting desired social norms around safety and hygiene.”Recently, though, the question has been: “What social norms?” In the early days, evidence of mask effectiveness was inconclusive but the goal to limit the spread of the virus was universal. Before vaccines or treatments we didn’t want to catch it and even thought we might be able to contain it.Now data on masks is much clearer. Observational studies report big reductions in infection (as high as 53 per cent). Two randomised trials, usually considered more reliable, report smaller, but still important, reductions of around 10 per cent. But stopping Covid’s spread is no longer so important to many people. Schools resemble chicken-pox parties, where parents drop off children to get them exposed to the virus, with the aim of better preparing them to fight infection later in life. Who now doesn’t expect to get Covid eventually?The answer, of course, is the elderly and vulnerable. But the fabric of social cohesion is fraying as more and more of us shrug and reconcile ourselves to the endemic nature of the disease. Liberty vs solidarity: the framing of today’s response is inherently political, Right vs Left. And nothing signals that better than a mask. As time has gone on, they have become ever-more like personal political broadcasts on behalf of the wearer. For the last few months, though, like manifestos out of campaign season, they have been largely uncontested. But today, once again, the national edict will freight them with moral significance. Prof David Halpern, chief executive of the Government’s Behavioural Insights Team, known as the Nudge Unit, who also sits on Sage, reckons that “the British are particularly good at this”.For the Government, such social policing has evident benefits: the brazen maskless commuter and the tutting double-masker hate each other, not Whitehall, which avoids becoming the target of widespread public ire. Some might argue that this is a blame-avoidance tactic dressed up as policy. Now, though, we are facing a rewind moment, a potential reset to March 2020. Instead of laissez-faire we are once again instructed to do our best to prevent the spread of the virus. This time, however, we all know from experience we cannot stop it. We can only delay. What price we are each prepared to pay to do that, after 18 months, is anyone’s guess. Government nudgers – long amazed by how compliant we’ve all been – may once again find themselves astonished and delighted. The risk is, of course, that the silent social self-regulation of British people finally gives way, and the phony war between Mask On-ers and Mask Off-ers collapses into open hostility.More from NewsGhislaine Maxwell trial: Socialite and Jeffrey Epstein both abused me in massage room, accuser claimsDonald Trump tells Boris Johnson he is making a ‘big mistake’ by backing wind powerGPs will get bonuses for helping with booster rolloutLorry drivers face £2,000 fine for every stowaway migrant, even after security checksF-35 fighter jet which plunged into sea has been found, reveals top security advisorCancer waiting list rise prompts calls for SNP to tackle ‘substantial’ NHS shortagesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ghosts variants past may bring comfort amid omicron gloom","story":"It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Which, as tradition dictates, heralds the advent of a new Covid variant that threatens to slam the door on festive fun like a harassed innkeeper.But lo! There may be a ray of light amid the omicron gloom: The Ghosts of Variants Past.It is worth remembering that we have been here before, and while variants have undoubtedly caused problems, they have never created anything like the devastation forecast when they first emerged.Take alpha. On December 14 last year, an ashen-faced Matt Hancock stood up in the House of Commons to inform MPs that a newly mutated coronavirus was spreading exponentially across Kent, London, Essex and Hertfordshire.Alpha had actually emerged in September, but was only discovered following an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown.By the time the authorities noticed there was a problem, the mutated strain was already out of stable, with more than 1,000 cases recorded across 60 local authorities.Unable to bolt the door in time, Boris Johnson was forced to cancel Christmas for millions on December 21, with many areas placed in Tier Four restrictions.We had the same issue with delta, which despite not being identified in Britain until April, had actually arrived by at least February.Today we are in a much better position to track the virus and try to limit its impact. Just a handful of cases of omicron have so far been found and NHS Test and Trace is working to throw a ring around contacts to stop it from spreading.Even if we do not manage to stop the spread of omicron, which many scientists think is unlikely, the previous variants give us hope that it will not be as deadly as feared, and vaccines will still work.In December, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested that alpha was between 34 per cent and 74 per cent more transmissible than the original strain.A study published in January by academics from the World Health Organisation (WHO) put it even higher, at 70-80 per cent.But in July, the University of Oxford assessed the spread of the alpha variant and found it had largely been carried by “super-seeding” events. Oxford scientists eventually determined it was around 30 to 40 per cent more transmissible than the original, wild-type virus.Similarly, on January 23 last year, a report by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) estimated alpha was 30 per cent more deadly, with early data suggesting the variant changed the death rate from 1 per cent to 1.3 per cent.But by March, Public Health England (PHE) had determined that the Kent variant was no more deadly than the original strain. Although it was linked to a 34 per cent increased risk of hospitalisation, no significant difference in the risk of mortality was observed.Undoubtedly, the Kent variant was responsible for the rapid rise of cases that led to the deadly winter wave, but if the original predictions had been right, we might have faced excess deaths closer to 100,000 rather than the 63,000 we actually saw.A similar pattern emerged with delta. On April 15, PHE announced that a new variant with worrying mutations had been found in the UK. By then, 77 cases had already been found, and within a month it was spreading through the country and doubling each week.On May 15, Boris Johnson warned the variant could “seriously disrupt” roadmap plans, and after apocalyptic modelling suggesting it could bring more than 200,000 deaths, Freedom Day on June 21 was pushed back a month.Yet the devastating delta wave never occurred, as it became clear that vaccines were holding up well against the new variant. Real-world data from PHE showed that AstraZeneca was 92 per cent effective against hospitalisation against delta while Pfizer was 96 per cent.Studies have since found it to be around 50 per cent more transmissible, with double the risk of hospitalisation for unvaccinated people compared to alpha. It is undoubtedly a scarier virus, yet our vaccines held up admirably.It was a similar story for the original South African variant - now known as beta. In February, South Africa halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab after trials showed that the beta variant all but wiped out any benefit of a vaccine.Critics pointed out at the time that the trial subjects had been young and healthy, which made the effectiveness against severe disease in those most at risk impossible to determine.They were right. Later studies found that a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine offered up to 80 per cent protection against hospitalisation and death.Although omicron is now showing up as the latest spectre at the feast, there is cause for optimism. Unlike South Africa, where the virus is spreading rapidly, we have high levels of vaccination.Nearly half the country has also now had a previous Covid infection, according to Cambridge University, meaning T-cell levels will be high, and these long-term memory immune cells are far better than antibodies at battling infections that look slightly different to the original virus.Most scientists think it is unlikely we will see complete immune escape from the vaccine, with some even suggesting this variant might bring a more infectious, but milder disease. Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, if true.So there are good reasons to stay merry and bright as Christmas approaches.

That advice had covered masks and foreign travel, but not socialising or working from home.Mr Johnson himself, though, seemed less sure when he was asked about the issue during a visit to a GP surgery in north London.I think it\u0027s always sensible to be careful,” he said. “But I think what Jenny is saying there is right, we\u0027ve been living with a pandemic for a long time, people should continue to do things like make sure they have lots of fresh air, they wash their hands and take normal precautions, I think that\u0027s entirely reasonable.”While he added that it was not necessary to change the current guidance, “what we do need to do is take particular precautions against omicron until we\u0027ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present”.In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, working from home has already been advised. In October, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said that Plan B measures - including guidance on working from home - should be implemented in unison across the UK to have the biggest effect in tackling any surge in coronavirus cases.Out of the inidual measures, Sage said working from home would have the biggest impact.But Downing Street has so far refused to reinstate guidance to work from home, in part because of the wider impact on the economy.The health minister, Gillian Keegan, told Sky News the Government is very much hoping that we can keep Christmas on track.Maggie Throup, the vaccines minister, did little to convince MPs that ministers were opposed to Dr Harries’ advice, when she told the Commons: “We all do enjoy socialising but...we are in a difficult situation at the moment, but we have personal responsibility as well.The Labour MP Rachael Maskell asked Ms Throup why, when Dr Harries was a public health professional and therefore really does understand what public health measures need to be taken to secure our wellbeing against this pandemic”, the Government was not listening to her.Tory backbenchers believed Labour had missed the point. They suspected Dr Harries, who had updated Cabinet on the omicron variant earlier in the day, was being used by ministers to scare the public into cancelling Christmas themselves, without ministers having to take the blame.Before a vote which rubber-stamped the Government’s plans to increase Covid restrictions, Conservative former public health minister Steve Brine said: There\u0027s nothing in these regulations that says you\u0027ve got to cancel Christmas parties, unless Dr Harries, of course, is in charge, but there\u0027s everything in the language and the narrative that\u0027s coming out of Government right now that is causing Christmas parties to be cancelled.Former minister Sir Christopher Chope said: “These regulations are part of a scaremongering propaganda campaign on the part of the Government, which is really designed to try to stop or restrict social interaction between social animals who happen to be living in the United Kingdom.That I think is potentially the most damaging aspect of these regulations before us today.They\u0027re designed to suppress freedom of the inidual and suppress social contact, and they\u0027re doing that through unreasonable fear-mongering.The final word went to Mr Johnson, who addressed the subject on television for the second time in a matter of hours as he hosted a Downing Street press conference. This time, his answers were crisper when he was asked whether the public should follow Dr Harries’ advice, he said: “The answer is no.”After the hospitality industry had reported on bookings being cancelled and parents had questioned whether Nativity plays would go ahead, Mr Johnson said: “We don\u0027t want people to cancel such events.”Working from home was “not currently necessary”, he said, as he encouraged people to take sensible precautions such as handwashing and increased ventilation.I\u0027m still confident that this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas, and that remains my view.More from NewsNew \u0026#39handyman\u0026#39 repair service will help elderly stay at homeMasks aren\u0026#39t a minor inconvenience.

While many of her activists are growing impatient with their quest for independence, the Scottish electorate is becoming less interested in the constitutional question. This conundrum is becoming increasingly clear to both sides, and the ultimate victim of the arising frustration will be Sturgeon herself.It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The First Minister had been in post less than two years when the Brexit vote supposedly reset the clock on independence and annulled the mandate of the 2014 referendum. Almost everyone, including many prominent Unionist supporters of the Remain campaign, had been very insistent that a Leave victory would be a gift to the SNP. Sturgeon herself seems to have believed it, setting her sails the morning after the vote to catch the winds of change.But they never came. Several years of tortuous and isive negotiations were not the advert for unpicking the United Kingdom that so many supposed.It was not until the pandemic, and the Government’s woeful mishandling thereof, that it looked as if public support for independence might be building and the doomsayers got to briefly dust off their I-told-you-sos. But even that fillip seems to have been temporary, and the Union is once again leading the polls.If Sturgeon seemed in 2016 to have time on her side, that is no longer the case. She is already Scotland’s longest-serving First Minister. Even if she does as she says and sees out the term of this Scottish Parliament, we are almost certainly entering the autumn of her leadership.Thus, the trap. As a pragmatist, Sturgeon understands that it would ill-serve the separatist cause to fight and lose two referenda in a row. It might even serve to bury the question, as it did in Quebec.Yet the SNP has conspicuously failed to build public support for their central mission, to the extent that the Government at Westminster feels able to simply refuse to grant the First Minister a second legally-binding vote.This probably suits the strategist in Sturgeon just fine. She gets to blame London for refusing the will of the people without actually having to risk putting her case to the people in unpropitious circumstances.But that isn’t good enough for much of her base. They are separatists first and foremost it’s what brought them into politics and it\u0027s why they back the SNP. It’s why they have for years put up with their party’s phalanx-like internal discipline. The SNP is perhaps the most formidable political machine in Britain, and it is animated and perhaps even held together by the anticipation of a referendum. (One reason Boris Johnson would be insane to grant one.)Every year, Sturgeon tells her supporters that the next great push for independence is just around the corner. It never comes to pass. Nor will it, unless a general election in 2023 somehow delivers a government at Westminster prepared to grant a legal referendum.She knows why a Catalan-style wildcat referendum is a bad idea. Even if the courts don’t block it (and it would only take a private citizen in Scotland to file the suit, not the UK Government), Unionists would simply boycott it.At the same time, it would undermine Scottish nationalism’s carefully-constructed international image — and perhaps make it that bit harder for the First Minister to find a comfortable role at the UN when she steps down from frontline politics, too.But the Nationalist infantry, whose cause is independence at any cost, have never accepted this logic. And they won’t let the grand old countess of Bute House march them up and down the hill forever.More from NewsNew \u0026#39handyman\u0026#39 repair service will help elderly stay at homeMasks aren\u0026#39t a minor inconvenience.

Today Boris Johnsonset a target of offering a booster to all those eligible “by the end of January”. That’s more than million boosters in just nine weeks.The best chance of a normal Christmas with our loved ones is to roll up our sleeves, Sajid Javid told the press conference. It’s hard-pressed NHS staff who have to roll their sleeves most of all - with troops also being called in to help. Here’s what you need to know about the latest announcements.Who is eligible for a booster All adults in the UK are now eligible for a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna. Previously all over-s and people with certain health conditions were being offered a third dose. On Monday that was extended to all over-s following a rapid review by the JCVI. This was to give the population further protection in the face of the Omicron iant. The question is now how it’s delivered.What is the gap between doses At the same time, the JCVI halved the minimum gap between second and third doses from six months to three months. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. So, can I get a booster jab now No, not necessarily. Taken together, the two changes suddenly made tens of millions of people eligible for a booster jab overnight. That means there is not enough capacity for everyone to get their jab straight away and they must book in a prioritised way. Under-s can’t book in yet because the UK Health Security Agency is still updating a Patient Group Directive, Green Book and National Protocol. This is expected to change in the coming days, though the NHS has not set a firm timetable. Boris Johnson said: “Evenyou have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please donapost try and book until the NHS says it is your turn.What order will people be offered a booster Boris Johnson confirmed: “As with the first jabs, we will be working through people by age group going down in five-year bands. “It is vital that the older and the more clinically vulnerable get that added protection first.” That means those aged - will be offered the booster, followed by -, then -, - and under-. In practice the booking system was known to open up to one year group at a time earlier this year. Those already eligible at the top of the list were people in residential care homes over-s frontline health and care workers and under-s with under-s with underlying health conditions and adults who share a household with immunosuppressed people. How will the NHS ramp up capacity Boris Johnson said England will have more than , community pharmacy sites, “all of” which will increase capacity. Shut-down “hospital hubs” will be reactivated and temporary vaccination centres will be “popping up like Christmas trees”, he claimed. As with the first rollout, troops will help. “We will deploy at least  military personnel to assist the efforts of our NHS”, the PM said. NHS England chief Amanda Pritchard said mobile vaccination units would do some of the work for hard-to-reach communities. But she added: “It can’t happen overnight, particularly given the other pressures facing NHS staff who are working extremely hard”. Is the January  target achievable The new target announced by Boris Johnson will force NHS chiefs to hugely ramp up the speed of booster jabs. Overall .million people have had a second dose while .million have had a booster or third dose. That leaves .millon who still need a booster by the end of January. With nine weeks to go, that means the NHS would have to average more than .million boosters a week - or more than .millionit took a week off over Christmas. Currently there is an average of around .million doses per week.

He added that we embrace James Bond even though we know it is not true le. Mr Robinson asked whether Mr Moore had ever donned a beard or moustache while skulking on the streets as a young agent, orthat is no longer the world that MI inhabits. Mr Moore said: If that was ever the world we lived in, thataposs certainly not the world we live in now. The MI chief today warned Chinese intelligence is mounting large-scale espionage operations against the UK and its allies as it attempts to steal technology and distort political decision-making.  In his first public speech since taking up the post last year, Richard Moore said the threat posed by a newly-assertive China was now the single greatest priority for his agency. Speaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London he warned a miscalculation by an over-confident regime in Beijing over an issue like Taiwan could pose a serious challenge to global peace. In a wide-ranging address, Mr Moore said Russia continued to represent an acute threat to the UK while the Taliban victory in Afghanistan had given a morale boost to extremists around the globe. On China, Mr Moore said the activities of their intelligence agencies included targeting iniduals working in government or industries they were interested in as well as seeking to monitor and exert undue influence on the Chinese diaspora. The tectonic plates are shting as Chinaaposs power, and its willingness to assert it, grows, he said. The Chinese intelligence services are highly capable and continue to conduct large-scale espionage operations against the UK and our allies. We are concerned by the Chinese governmentaposs attempt to distort public discourse and political decision making across the globe.  Mr Moore said Beijingaposs growing military strength and its desire to achieve its long-standing claim to Taiwan issue, by forcenecessary, posed a serious challenge to global stability and peace. Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and underestimates Washingtonaposs resolve. The risk of Chinese miscalculation through over-confidence is real, he said. He said the surveillance state technologies which China had developed to suppress its own people, such as the minority Uighur population, were being made available to other authoritarian regimes. Worryingly, these technologies of control and surveillance are increasingly being exported to other governments by China: expanding the web of authoritarian control around the planet, he said. Adapting to a world affected by the rise of China is the single greatest priority for MI. We need to be able to operate undetected as a secret intelligence agency within the surveillance web worldwide. On Russia, Mr Moore said that it was essential for Western countries to stand up to the full spectrum of threats from Moscow - from state-sanctioned attacks, such as the Salisbury poisoning to the use political political proxies to undermine stability in the Balkans. No country, in Europe or beyond, should be seduced into thinking that unbalanced concessions to Russia bring better behaviour, he said Moscow should be in no doubt of our alliesapos support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally-recognised borders including Crimea. On Afghanistan, Mr Moore said the priority was to prevent the country being used again as a base for major international terrorist attacks by groups like al Qaida now it was back in control of the Taliban. As an intelligence community we will now do this aposoutside inapos: working from the outside to identy and disrupt any threats from a resurgent al Qaida, he said. This is an extremely dficult task, and will rely extensively on regional partnerships as well as coordination with our allies. At the same time, he said MI was engaging with the Taliban and testing their willingness to cooperate and to honour their promises not to allow al Qaida to rebuild an external operations capability.

So what exactly is changing and how will it affect you  Here are all your questions answered.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face masks are mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. They will also be compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. But masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants, or cinemas and theatres, like they were before. Government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, but this is not a legal requirement. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Ten African countries were added to England’s red list over the weekend, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. The  nations are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Those who breach isolation rules can be fined between £ and £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.Those affected will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace. It’s not thought the Covid- app will single out those who have to isolate.Elsewhere, people travelling to the UK must self-isolate until their Day  test is negative - as above. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. And unvaccinated or partially-vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must still self-isolate for  days, regardless of whether it’s the Omicron iant.Who will get a booster vaccine - and when All adults in the UK will now be offered a Covid booster vaccine - Pfizer or Moderna - in a much shorter time period than before. Third doses will be fast-tracked, with people able to get them three months instead of six months after their second dose. While immunity is said to be better with a six-month gap, the JCVI watchdog weighed that up against the risks of waiting too long with a new iant. However, people will have to wait for their place in the queue. Boosters will be offered in descending order of age in five-year brackets. So -year-olds may have to wait a while. Downing Street was unable to say how long the booster rollout will take. No hopes to see a more detailed timetable published by NHS England “in the coming days”. People should not yet go online and try to booktheyaposre . Meanwhile --year-olds will be offered a second dose. Will schools shut early for Christmas Since Monday, the government is “strongly advising” school pupils above year , staff, and visitors to wear face coverings in communal areas of England’s schools. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread. But No insisted schools will not shut early for Christmas this year. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said the Government will keep schools open until they had absolutely no choice but to close the institutions down. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People do not need by law to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues. Health Minister Edward Argar said the government will let people in England “use their judgments” about whether to attend festive bashes this year. But the minister also warned people “will reflect carefully on how they are going to react” to the new iant. Voluntary government guidance advises people to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces, and take a lateral flow test before socialising with other people. Why are these restrictions being introduced Scientists are alarmed by the Omicron iant because it has more than  mutations, which potentially means it could resist the vaccine. Therefore, the government is introducing restrictions to buy time for scientists to work out whether it’s as bad as they fear. At the moment, No admitted, “no one has any hard evidence of its impact on things like hospitalisations”. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said scientists must get live samples of the Omicron virus and test them, asking the public: Please, everyone needs to give us time to assemble that data.He added: “I’m asking people not to panic - but I’m not asking them either to completely ignore the weather forecast.” Are the rules strong enough to work Several key figures say they are not. Labour’s Angela Rayner called for mask mandates to also apply to pubs and other hospitality settings, when people are moving around. She added: “Itaposs so important that people wear masks when theyaposre indoors, in arenas where theyaposre meeting people and... mixing in large numbers.”Scotland and Wales’ First Ministers wrote to Boris Johnson demanding all UK arrivals isolate for eight days, with PCR tests on day  and day . Currently they’ll only have to isolate until a Day  test comes back negative. Health Secretary Sajid Javid insisted his approach was “proportionate”. Will the rules be tightened further It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s ‘Plan B’ measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve. The government has also not advised people in England to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. But the PM’s spokesman did not rule out tighter travel rules. No said Boris Johnson was not “planning” to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation, but did not rule it out, saying the response would be kept under review.When will they expire The measures will last three weeks and expire on December , with a review ahead of that. That means they could be ended, continued or strengthened in time for Christmas. MPs will also get a vote on the measures on Tuesday.

Indeed, we fully expect that there will be more cases identied over the coming days that are also linked to this event.Five of the cases are in the NHS Lanarkshire area and four in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.Earlier in the day Ms Sturgeon told MSPs: “We have preliminary information on all nine cases - which is the basis of the information I am about to share with Parliament - however, health protection teams are continuing their investigations. “Let me say, firstly, that none of the people who have tested positive have so far required hospital care.  “All nine were tested on and around  November and because they had tested positive they have all been self-isolating. “A surveillance look back exercise had identied that the PCR test results in these cases showed what is called the S gene dropout - this is not conclusive evidence of the Omicron iant, but indicative of it. “However, whole genome sequencing of these positive samples has now identied that they are indeed the Omicron iant.” She also said that it is being investigated whether there is a link to COP, which was held in Glasgow between October  - November , with representatives from all over the world attending.  The First Minister said: “Given the nature and scale of COP, the surveillance work that Public Health Scotland is doing is also looking at any potential links to it. “At this stage, however, there is no evidence whatsoever of any such link - and, while it is not impossible that one will emerge, I think the timelines involved make it improbable.” It is feared that the new iant may be more resistant to vaccines. Scotlandaposs health secretary Humza Yousaf this morning announced that the number of cases in the country had risen to nine, while there have been five confirmed cases in England. Today the head of the UK Health Security Agency, Dr Jenny Harries, said that there were a further  highly likely cases. Scientists around the world are scrambling to find outthe iant, classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation , is more deadly.

Here’s what’s changed and a snap profile of each big playerKeir Starmer and his new team crossing a look left sign this morning Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political EditorAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsLabouraposs rising stars have been recognised in Sir Keir Starmeraposs second reshuffle of the year, as he seeks to create a serious party of Government. Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson have been given big departments to look after as the leader moves his team further away from the Corbyn-era left.And heavyweights Yvette Cooper and David Lammywon two of the biggest roles in the shadow cabinet.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour ’s plans to tackle sleaze.She said: I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it.  You may have been blindsided too - since it all happened on a major day of Covid news. So who’s rising up the ranks and who was demoted from a top job  Here’s everything you need to know.PROMOTED Yvette Cooper - Shadow Home SecretaryA starto Labour’s top team, the MP since  served under Blair, Brown and Miliband and came third in the  leadership race.Her job as Shadow Home Secretary - where she took on Theresa May - ended when she said she could not serve under Jeremy Corbyn.As DWP Secretary in  she faced controversy over benefit sanctions in the Welfare Reform Bill, and her views on Corbyn cast a shadow for the left. But away from the front bench, she carved out a fearsome reputation as chair of the Home Affairs Committee, sharply interrogating Priti Patel. Born to a union chief and maths teacher, the -year-old went from a state comprehensive to a first-class Oxford degree. After a year off with ME aged  - “I hated every minute of it” - she worked on Bill Clinton’s  presidential bid. Following her ascent in Westminster, she and husband Ed Balls made history as the first married couple to serve in Cabinet together. David Lammy - Shadow Foreign SecretaryThe outspoken -year-old from Tottenham enjoys a promotion from Justice to one of the traditional great offices of state. As a friend of Barack Obama with contacts in the US Senate, he may take more naturally to the role than ‘Red Wall’-focused Lisa Nandy. Elected in , he rose through the ranks under Blair and Brown before a -year backbench spell under Miliband and Corbyn. On the back benches he campaigned powerfully for the Windrush generation and Grenfell victims, which included a friend of his, with viral speeches. He was an outspoken anti-Brexit MP during years of rows and stirred debate in  when he argued Comic Relief ‘perpetuates Band Aid stereotypes’. But he is not easily pigeon-holed, chairing a review of racism in the justice system for the Tory government, and nominating Corbyn for leadership. Wes Streeting - Shadow Health SecretaryAged , the former National Union of Students President and MP since  will be seen as a moderniser in the top team.He worked for the Blairite group Progress for a year after graduating and was a staunch critic of Jeremy Corbyn, joining Keir Starmer ’s front bench in May this year.Born to teenage parents, he grew up on an east London council estate, had free school meals and was the first in his family to go to university.He has personal experience of the NHS, having a kidney removed earlier this year due to cancer.Bridget Phillipson - Shadow Education SecretaryThe -year-old enjoys a promotion from Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury to holding the Tories to account over schools. Elected in , this is the biggest role yet for the Houghton and Sunderland South MP. She joined Labour aged , attended a Catholic school and co-chaired the Oxford University Labour club.A backer of David Miliband, Yvette Cooper, Owen Smith and Keir Starmer, she supported remain and a People’s Voteon Brexit.Peter Kyle - Shadow Northern Ireland SecretaryIt is the first Shadow Cabinet job for the -year-old frontbencher, who was elected to Hove in . He was a vocal opponent of Brexit and led a bid, blocked by Tories, to lower the voting age to . A former special advisor and charity chief, he backed Liz Kendall and Jess Phillips in the  and  leadership elections. Pat McFadden - Shadow Chief Secretary to the TreasuryThis is the first shadow cabinet job for more than a decade for the ex-Blair and Brown minister.From a family of seven children to a labourer and children’s home worker who grew up in Glasgow, -year-old was an advisor to Tony Blair before and after the  election.Shadow Europe Minister under Jeremy Corbyn, he was was sacked by the left-wing leader in . Mr McFadden lost his job for asking the Prime Minister to reject the view that sees terrorist acts as always being a response or a reaction to what we in the west do.MOVED Lisa Nandy - Shadow Levelling Up SecretarySome would see a move from Shadow Foreign Secretary as a demotion, but not the Wigan MP. When the -year-old won her last job a colleague was said to remark: “That’s a lot of towns, Nandy”.And askedshadowing Michael Gove and the government’s key policy area felt like a demotion, Ms Nandy told BBC Breakfast: It felt a little like coming home, to be honest.”She has for years beat the drum about left-behind northern areas, co-founding the Centre For Towns think tank. She co-chaired Owen Smith’s  challenge to Corbyn and ran herself for the top job in , coming third. Steve Reed - Shadow Justice SecretaryThe -year-old is moving from the Shadow Communities Secretary job to his second shadow cabinet post. Unlike many others who’ve been promoted he was consistently a minister under Jeremy Corbyn. Born in Hertfordshire, he worked in publishing for almost two decades before becoming an MP. His dad played for Charlton Athletic and he knew Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker when he went to university in Sheffield. Mr Reed founded the Labour Together group and helped run Keir Starmer’s  leadership campaign. Jo Stevens - Shadow Wales SecretaryFormer Shadow Culture secretary Jo Stevens was demoted to Shadow Welsh Secretary, replacing Nia Grfith. Since September this year she had been up against Nadine Dorries, the controversial Tory minister. Born in Swansea, she worked for a solicitors’ firm before winning Cardf Central in , ousting the Lib Dems.She had this job before under Corbyn, but resigned from it in  to vote against triggering Article  and Brexit. Lucy Powell - Shadow Culture SecretaryAnother sideways move, Lucy Powell shts from the ministry of housing to the ‘ministry of fun’. The Manchester Central MP worked at Labour HQ during the  election and later helped lead an inquest into the party’s  defeat.Jonathan Reynolds - Shadow Business SecretaryThe long-time political aide and MP since  is another survivor through both the Miliband and Corbyn eras.As shadow DWP chief he announced Labour would cut the ‘taper’ in Universal Credit - which the Tories later did.He had suggested he was open to the idea of a Universal Basic Income but later cooled on the costly plan.Louise Haigh - Shadow Transport SecretaryThe -year-old was for a time Parliament’s youngest Labour MP and has enjoyed a steady rise. The former Unite shop steward and Special Constable supported Owen Smith’s  leadership challenge but also served as Policing Minister under Corbyn. More recently she has landed attacks on Tory ministers over Northern Ireland amid chaos over Brexit. After being Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, the Transport brief is her second job. Nick Thomas-Symonds - Shadow Trade SecretaryFew would argue the reshuffle was a demotion for the historian, who has written biographies of Attlee and Bevan. He took a finely-judged approach to the thorny issue of migration in the face of hardline statements by Priti Patel. Elected an MP in , the -year-old is another of those who served in junior ranks throughout Corbyn’s time.Ed Miliband - Shadow Climate Change and Net Zero SecretaryThe former Labour leader had enjoyed ato the shadow cabinet under Keir Starmer. However, his job has now been split into two - one covering business and the other climate change. This will give him more time to focus on climate change, on which he has campaigned relentlessly in recent years. But it could prove dficult for him to land a blow on the government, given the role he’s shadowing doesn’t technically exist.Jon Ashworth - Shadow Work and Pensions SecretaryNicknamed ‘Sparkle’, the No advisor in the Blair Brown years proved a survivor even through the Corbyn era. An MP since a  by-election has had  years of unbroken service on the front bench including as the longest-serving Labour shadow health secretary in history. He was moved while off sick with Covid, but insisted it was good news, telling friends he needed a new challenge.Emily Thornberry - Shadow Attorney GeneralThe MP equivalent of a Duracell bunny, the lawyer was another survivor through the era of Corbyn, who was her Islington constituency neighbour. But she’s slipped from the top of the pack since doing the Shadow Foreign Secretary job under the former leader. She was notorious in  for tweeting a photo of a house in Kent with a white van and England flags. The lawyer was accused of snobbery and was later “squeezed out” of the  Labour leadership race, not winning enough nominations to go to the members’ vote. But her story is not what you might think - she told the Mirror in  how she remembered bailfs coming to her home, where her mum’s cats were put down because she was too poor to care for them. Jim McMahon - Shadow Environment SecretaryThe -year-old - moved from Transport - is another junior member of the top team and like Lisa Nandy, another voice for towns in the north. He was a council leader in Oldham and represented councillors on Labour’s ruling NEC before winning the  Oldham West and Royton by-election. His victory defied fears Corbyn’s Labour would tank at the ballot box - at least then - and he’s been on the front bench almost ever since.OUT Kate Green - Shadow Education Secretary Luke Pollard - Shadow Environment Secretary Nia Grfith - Shadow Welsh Secretary Cat Smith - Shadow Voter Engagement MinisterCharlie Falconer - Shadow Attorney General STAYING PUT Keir Starmer - Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner - Deputy Leader, Shadow First Secretary of State, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work Rachel Reeves - Shadow Chancellor John Healey - Shadow Defence Secretary Jenny Chapman - Shadow Cabinet Office minister Anneleiese Dodds - Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary and Chair of Labour Policy Review Rosena Allin-Khan - Shadow Cabinet Minister for Mental Health Preet Gill - Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development Ian Murray - Shadow Scottish Secretary Shabana Mahmoud - National Campaign Co-Ordinator Alan Campbell - Shadow Chief Whip Angela Smith - Shadow Lords Leader Roy Kennedy - Opposition Lords chief whip Thangam Debbonaire - Shadow Commons leaderRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Peter KyleJonathan ReynoldsWes StreetingDavid LammyPat McFaddenSteve ReedYvette CooperPoliticsShadow Cabinet reshuffle\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A string of backbenchers declined to don a face covering during a tetchy debate on new Covid regulations to battle the spread of the new Omicron iant. New measures include the mandatory use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and PCR tests for all international arrivals from am on Tuesday.At one point in the debate the Mirror counted  Tories without masks and  wearing them - while three Labour MPs and one Lib Dem MP all had their masks on.MPs usually remove their face coverings to speak in the Commons and it is worth noting that some may have reasons exempting them from wearing them. But a number of Tory backbenchers made it clear they were unhappy with the imposition of new restrictions. SNP frontbencher Dr Philippa Whitford accused the Government of undermining its own mask advice in recent months by failing to wear them in Parliament. Since July, masks have not been mandatory but the guidance recommended people wear them in busy indoor spaces. That guidance has been undermined by the demonstration on television every day of members of the Government benches, she said. People will be led by example, not just the Prime Ministeraposs but others. Boris Johnsonaposs failure to wear a mask during a visit to Hexham General Hospital earlier this month has made it more unlikely that people will obey new mask rules, according to Liberal Democrat MP Daisy Cooper. She said: One of the major problems being faced by GPs in my constituency of St Albans is that some people are refusing to wear masks because they quote aposthat the Prime Minister didnapost have to when he went to a hospitalapos. Can I ask the minister how she intends to lead by example when half of her own colleagues are still refusing to wear masks on the benches opposite   Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup said: We are mandating the use of face coverings. I think we are in a dferent situation in regards to that. She later defended the mask mandate, saying: The broader data shows that even non-medical masks such as cloth masks made of two or three layers may have similar filtration efficiency to surgical masks. In a testy debate, Tory backbenchers lined up to express fury at the boss of the UK Health Security Agency , who called on people to limit socialising in the run up to Christmas. Dr Jenny Harries said the public could slow the spread of the new Omicron iant by reducing their social contacts. But she was slapped down by the PMaposs spokesman, who said: No. Our advice to the public is as set out at the weekend.We have put advice out on face coverings and on inward travellers and those who are identied as having the Omicron iant of coronavirus.  Beyond that we havenapost set out any further guidance to the public. Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup faced repeated questions from angry backbenchers on the remarks, Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne said: Will she deprecate those public appointees who, not withstanding the clear proportionate advice of the chief scientic adviser, have been out on the air waves telling people that they shouldnapost socialise, to the huge detriment of peopleaposs wellbeing and industries struggling to recover from earlier lockdowns  Ms Throup replied: We all do enjoy socialising but aswill appreciate that we are in a dficult situation at the moment, but we have personal responsibility as well. Influential backbencher Steve Baker said the Government was facing chaos. He asked the minister: Is she seriously saying that it is not for ministers to have any particular view on officials employed within the department going out and taking a position which is at odds with the Governmentaposs public policy decision  Becausethat really is now the policy we have got, that even employees of departments can take their own personal positions, we really are facing chaos and the overturning of longstanding Government principles. Ms Throup said: I would like to reiterate that I do not speak for other people but what I am doing today is putting out the measures that we have implemented as of this morning in a timely fashion and it is the measures that we are considering today and from the Governmentaposs point of view this is the legislation we are implementing. MPs will vote on the regulations later, which have already come into force under emergency Covid powers.

Iso Neville, , from London Bridge, spends her time rooting out second hand bargains in vintage shops to add to her wardrobe - and she applies the same rationale to buying for other people too. Stylish Iso, who is head of social media for an art agency, spends an average of £ on her Christmas gts every year - saving about £ compared to the average spend in the UK on gts, according to Atomik Research. She said: As a teen, normal high street clothing shops were too far away for me, without getting a lt from my parents. “Instead, I would my browse the charity shops near home and quickly found there were plenty of treasures there for sale at a bargain price. “Now that I’m older, I don’t see a need to shop at fast fashion stores when second-hand shops have such great quality items.”For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here In , Iso vowed to go  per cent second hand in a bid to save money, avoid waste and help the environment. The blogger said a shocking statistic convinced her to make the change - that there are enough clothes on earth now to clothe the next six generations. “Sustainability is very important to me and there are very good quality clothes in charity shops, which outlive your average clothes in a fast fashion shop,” she said. After making the switch in her own le, Iso has applied her second-hand way of living to her gt buying too. She said: “Friends and family know how much I believe in charity shops, so they now expect all the presents I buy to be second-hand. “No one has ever complained to me, because it’s the thought that counts and, after all, you would never even know the items weren’t new!” She also says people compliment her on her incredible discoveries, which she hopes will lt the stigma attached to buying things second hand. She said: “Since lockdown, it seems a lot of people in the UK have been having a clear out, because there’s so much choice at the moment in charity shops. “You can really find some amazing stuff and I’ve even been able to furnish my home with things I’ve bought at Barnardo’s.” This year, Iso has already found plenty of ideal gts for her loved ones in charity shops. She said: “I have a friend who recently got into tennis, so I found a pack of brand-new Wimbledon tennis balls and pins in a local charity shop, which I’ll give to her this Christmas. “A good top tip for thrty gt giving is to get a plant from the garden centre and buy a plant pot from a charity shop to go with it. “No one would ever know it’s second-hand and they often have very quirky and interesting plant pots for sale. Childrenaposs charity Barnardoaposs teamed up with Atomik Research to commission research into peopleaposs Christmas present intentions this year - which suggested two thirds of people in the UK will consider shopping in charity shops. The research also suggested people consider thoughtfulness as key in finding the perfect gt, with sustainability also an important consideration. Iso said: “I’m very environmentally conscious and Christmas can be quite a wasteful time of year, but it doesn’t have to be. “I use my social media to kind of spread that message and to make sure thatIaposm posting a photo, people are aware that everything Iaposm wearing is second-hand. “A lot of people will have tighter purse strings this Christmas after the effects of the pandemic, so charity shopping is an excellent way to save some extra cash.” Isoaposs five top tips for finding charity shop bargains are: . Search regularly - pop into your local shop twice a month or so as new stock is updated daily. . Browse online - Barnardoaposs has a great website - and Thrt+ allows you to shop second-hand and choose which charity to donate the proceeds to. .

But when it comes to gts, they have a less traditional approach – opting to treat their daughters to lavish vacations to Disney World, Jamaica and cruises around the globe.The home, which measures over , sq. ft, is covered in festive displays, with everything from the dining room table to the bedrooms transformed.Snowmen are dotted around the property, alongside fairy lights and dozens of decorative ornaments. On their decorations alone, the family has splashed a whopping £, this year already.Get the news you want straight to yourinbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.We love Christmas decorations and decorating as much as possible, said Courtney, who goes by @texasthighs on Instagram.We like to make every inch feel like the magic of Christmas, and love to sit and take in all the decorations and lights and really feel the holiday spirit. I have always loved snowmen so we always include fun snowmen around the house and yard – that probably comes from living in Texas and rarely ever having snow, so I always longed for snow to build a snowman. Ever since we have had more space in our home, we now love including more Christmas trees around the house so that we can include more themes and colours and fun extras. She continued: We have eight Christmas trees in the house that we put up and decorate. Our ft tree is the most fun with all the ornaments. I want people to be wowed and want to see all the little details and fun things we put up throughout the house. I want my decorations to make people feel happy and even nostalgic – I want everyone to have the same warm and fuzzy feelings I get. Our girls are growing up so fast, so we love seeing their faces still light up too. As well as showing their appreciation for the holidays through their lavish décor, the minted couple also like to dote on their loved ones with special gts. We love to buy gts for our friends and family – it’s fun to spoil the little ones as well as show our love to the adults as well, said Courtney. And as well as donating to charity, they award special tips to their awesome helpers including their cleaners and gardeners. We spend roughly ,on gts for our circle of friends and family, the mum-of-two continued. Then of course we like to make our daughters feel extra special too – we work really hard to actually surprise them because they usually have the things they want and need already. This year, that means exciting trips to Jamaica and Disney World costing between -, , plus a further -,spent on additional gts for the girls. But Christmas hasn’t always been quite so luxurious for the family. Courtney explained: We had years in the past where we struggled and worked extra hard to make things special. I would craft decorations by using stuff from the dollar store, we would scrape and use credit cards to buy the girls gts. One year we even cleared out and cleaned up Nickaposs personal iPad to give to our oldest who really wanted an iPad like her friends.We would go in the freezing cold for Black Friday deals and scope the buy sell trade sites for anything we could find to make it special and fun for them. Our girls are so sweet and they know Christmas isnapost about gts but we know as kids from our own childhoods that itaposs hard to see friends getting huge blowout Christmases while your family struggles – so we always wanted to surprise them as much as we could. Now, they are still the same sweet girls but we get to do even more fun Christmas events and spend time making fun holiday memories that we used to not be able to afford. This year, the parents have not needed to set a budget. Courtney said: We don’t really look at prices, we’re more centred on just making sure they each get equally surprised. It is definitely in the several thousands for the girls combined. The trips cost anywhere from -, – plus whatever we spend while there – and then we spend another food -, on the girls depending on what trip we book. They get gts that coordinate with the trips, plus a few other things they want. Last year we did a fun scavenger hunt with small gts and clues that led them to a final box with a Disney trip booked. To some it may seem excessive to spend that much on a holiday, but it’s something that is fun for the four of us. We don’t spend thousands on designed shoes or clothes or other excessive items, so Christmas is our big splurge and the time where we go all out. We get to have fun making our home a Christmas wonderland – as well as spoil our loved ones.

The UK Health Security Agency gave the advice as the number of confirmed cases in the UK increased to  this morning, as three more were reported in Scotland. UKHSA head Dr Jenny Harries, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “Our behaviours in winter and particularly around Christmas we tend to socialise more so I think all of those will need to be taken into account.”Asked whether people should be told to work from home in England, as is happening in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, she said: “We’ve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and I’d like to think of it more in a general way, which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay.  “So I think being careful, not socialising when we don’t particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs.” So far nine people have been identied with Omicron in Scotland, along with five in England. Dr Harries said there could be a further  “highly likely” cases.The NHS is preparing a plan to ramp up Covid- vaccinations in an effort to protect Britain against an expected wave of the new Omicron iant.Health chiefs are working in a revised strategy for the “most complex phase” of the UK’s vaccination programme to deliver around  million more jabs in the coming months.  There will be a Downing Street briefing providing more detail on when under-s can get a booster this afternoon. The Government has tasked the already-overstretched service to put the booster programme “on steroids, with the interval after second doses halved to three months. Currently around . million doses a week are being administered but this need to rise to the . million being carried out earlier this year. Since then a number of mass vaccination centres have closed and many GPs - tasked with clearing the record NHS backlog - stopped administering the vaccines. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , told BBC Breakfast: “This is a programme which is all about speed.  “So the two challenges are going to be the logistics of actually delivering so much vaccine in a very short time and of course, it’s important that people come forward and receive those jabs in good time so that they can build up that extra immunity that we need to be sure that we’re protected against this new iant. “So itaposs a challenging month ahead for the NHS.” He added: “The worry is thatyou give somebody double work to do, they can’t do whatever  it was that they would have been doing.” The NHS is looking to bring more vaccination hubs back on stream despite already being under more pressure than any other time in its history. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. An NHS England spokesman, said: “The NHS is having to work at extreme pace to respond to this new iant and to put in place the next and most complex phase of the successful Covid- vaccination programme. “Following updated guidance from the JCVI today, the NHS will shortly set out how staff will expand the booster programme – this will include how booster jabs will be given in priority order so that the most vulnerable people are protected first, while also increasing capacity to vaccinate millions more people in a shorter space of time. “The NHS will contact you when you are due to book in for your lesaving booster vaccination, and when you get the call, it’s vital that people come forward as quickly as possible.” Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that even though vaccination experts have reduced the time frame between second jabs and boosters, it was likely people would still be waiting for a period of months before being called forward. “Many of the premises of vaccine hubs have now reverted to their everyday use,” he told Talk Radio. “Many of the volunteers about got jobs and they’ve gone back to work. “I don’t think it’s going to be possible to get the same kind of speed and capacity as we as we saw earlier . “So allowing people to get jabs from three months after their last dose, in practice, I suspect that most, mostly it will be for four or five, even six months.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSRadio Nottingham Trent UniversityBoris JohnsonBBC BreakfastR TodayPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Canadian province of Quebec suffered a poor harvest of maple syrup and has been forced to release about  million pounds of the golden stuff to keep up with demands. This represents the biggest dip into its strategic reserves since  and means the province is emptying half of its total stockpile. Speaking to the Times, Hélène Normandin, a spokeswoman for the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers federation, said: “This is the purpose of the reserve. To make sure we never miss maple syrup.” The French-speaking province is responsible for  per cent of the world’s maple syrup.  The rest is produced in other Canadian provinces, and in the US and its production, sales and marketing are all closely guarded by the powerful bloc Normandin spoke for. So a shortage here could represent a global issue for those who favour it at breakfast. The shortage came about due to a number of reasons. This year saw a  per cent surge in global demand with more people being at home thanks to Covid and lockdowns. Combined with an unusually warm and short spring in the area, producers have struggled to meet demand, and turned to their emergency supplies. Golden syrup is made from the sap of maple trees. This sap can only flow naturally between late February and April, when daytime temperatures oscillate between freezing and thawing. Coming after two record breaking seasons in , and , this year saw the syrup yield drop  per cent to  million pounds.  To ensure demand can be met in , the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers will be tapping seven million more trees. Their reserves are kept safe in high-security warehouses, each the size of five football pitches, located in northeast Montreal. In , during a shocking months-long robbery, £million worth of syrup was siphoned off and replaced with water.

The creature slipped out of its owneraposs home in Whitchurch, Bristol last week, sparking a missing ferret appeal.But on Friday night, the quite a large chap for a ferret snuck in and snuggled up in the bed of a Bristol couple as the storm battered the city outside.And since being found, heaposs been nicknamed Snoozy by those caring for him because heaposs done nothing but sleep, Bristol Live reports.When the baffled couple realised there was a furry animal in their bed, they called the local vets. Highcroft Vets checked him over on Saturday, and christened him Stinky Pete after the character in Toy Story.But his perpetual dozing led to a renaming when he was transferred to the Bristol Animal Rescue Centre. Highcroft Vets said they have been swarmed with ferret-related calls after putting pictures of Snoozy on Facebook.They have asked people to stop calling. “It must have been quite a shock for the couple,” said a spokesperson for Bristol ARC. “Ferrets are really clever and love to escape, and they are terric diggers, so it’s actually quite hard to keep them contained sometimes. “Obviously he’s got out but found himself at night in the big, cold winter storm so has found a catflap and gone inside to get warm and dry. “We don’t know the details of the couple who found him, but apparently he got into their bed in the middle of the night. Maybe they have pets of their own and are used to them getting on the bed, but they would not have expected a ferret,” she added. “He weighs about a kilo, which is pretty big for a ferret. We’ve been calling him Snoozy, because he was obviously pretty tired from his adventure and has spent most of the time with us sleeping,” she said. Appeals to find the real owner of the ferret appear to have been successful - and Snoozy’s family is expected to collect him today.

Neil said: It’s taken us two years to get to this point and get them on a flight.  “The phone call came at the th hour, we were ready to give up, take a refund and just move on to try and find another route for them back home which could have taken months. “I set out to help get them home.

The Prime Minister is once again facing anxious questions ahead of the festive period as he looks to avoid another disaster similar to  months ago. A year ago England had been in a national lockdown for three weeks, but unknown to the public a new iant - thought to have originated in Kent - was starting to rip through the country. Despite the restrictions, more than , lives were lost to the virus in a week last year - a figure that would tragically rise dramatically in coming days. Fast forward a year and the number of people testing positive is dramatically higher than  levels, but the link between cases and serious illness and death appears to have been dented.However the unwelcome emergence of the Omicron iant, with  confirmed cases in the UK so far, has understandably raised fears of another miserable festive period.Here we look at the latest figures compared to the situation last year, when the PM belatedly scrapped plans for Christmas mixing. Cases Itaposs important to stress at this point that comparing like-for-like is dficult. A year ago England had been in a national lockdown for more than three weeks, and this had caused cases to fall dramatically. Unknown to most at the time a new iant, Delta, was driving up infection rates in parts of the South East in spite of restrictions, and in the weeks to come cases rose to record levels. On November ,  - a Sunday - the Department of Health confirmed , people had tested positive for Covid. Fast forward exactly a year and that number is , - . times more.  Although comparing inidual days can be misleading - especially when one is a Sunday while the other is a weekday - there is a stark dference in the seven-day picture. In the past week there have been , confirmed infections, whereas in  the seven-day total was ,. Looking at cases alone, the UK is undoubtedly in a worse position than it was a year ago - but this is not the full picture. Deaths Yesterday the Department of Health confirmed that a further  lives had been lost to Covid-. The tragic figure meant that in the previous week,  people had died within  days of contracting the virus. This figure is just under a quarter of the weekly death toll a year ago, according to Department of Health data. In the week leading up to November , , , Covid deaths were recorded across the UK. On November  alone there were  fatalities, more than six times higher than the daily figure exactly a year later.While every coronavirus death is a tragedy, the UK is conclusively in a better position than it was  months ago, with vaccines severely denting the link between high cases and hospitalisations and deaths. Hospitalisations Last winter was like no other frontline medics had seen before, and one they never want to see repeated. Yet again, the dference between last yearaposs figures and the current situation is stark. On November , , there were , patients in hospital with Covid- across the UK, according to the Department of Health. Tragically with the lting of lockdown restrictions this would soar, and by the middle of January more than , people were being treated. Latest figures show , people were in hospital with the virus on Friday - the latest figure available, with  in ventilation beds.This is an enormous strain for exhausted NHS staff who are desperate to avoid the horrendous tragedy that unfolded in December and January last year.But again it is impossible not to conclude that vaccines and booster jabs have made the UKaposs current predicament better than it was  months ago. Vaccinations  It was a huge boost to the national morale when Margaret Keenan became the first NHS patient to be vaccinated against Covid. The -year-old was given her first jab at her local hospital in Coventry and said she couldnapost wait to safely spend time with her family. But that wouldnapost happen until December , meaning that this time last year the UK population was unvaccinated, aside from those who had participated in trials. Fast forward a year and the progress has been extraordinary, although there is still some way to go. Latest figures show that  per cent of the population aged above  have had at least one jab, with . million receiving two jabs and . million now with three doses. There is evidence that vaccines begin to wane after six months, prompting a huge booster jab drive with adults urged to take their third jab when they become eligible and avoid the nightmare of last winter.  Variants This is the big unknown. Twelve months ago, although the public didnapost know it, the notorious Delta iant was taking root in parts of the country and would soon become the dominant strain.It wasnapost until the middle of December that a worried Boris Johnson announced that a new highly transmissible version of the virus had been identied.With an unvaccinated population, this spelled disaster in the UK, with Covid deaths spiralling in December and January, finally prompting the PM to impose a third national lockdown. There was an undoubted sense of deja-vu when the government announced at the weekend that the first cases of the Omicron iant had been found on these shores. It remains to be seen whether it can evade vaccines and whether it leads to more serious illness. Medics in South Africa, where the new mutant strain was first identied, have said that it does not appear to be more deadly, but scientists worry it could be more transmissible. So where does this leave Christmas  At the weekend the PM was repeatedly quizzed about his outlook for the festive period. He said he is hopeful that no restrictions will be necessary - but then he said this last year before abruptly admitting his aposbubbleapos plan wasnapost feasible. There are currently  days until Christmas, which in Covid terms is a long time. On November  last year there were , cases, but by Christmas Day this had more than doubled to December . As long as hospitalisations remain comparatively now the government will be optimistic a relatively normal Christmas can go ahead. Experts will be keeping a very close eye on the data over the coming days and weeks.

As mask wearing s in the UK, here are some ways to stop your glasses foggingFogging is caused by the dference in temperatures between our breath, our lenses and the environment Image: GettyByMalvika Padin:,  Nov | commentsFace coverings have become mandatory again on public transport and retail settings in the UK, as the government works to slow the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus iant.Wearing a mask keeps you safe but it come with its own set of challenges such as acne and rashes. And, one of the biggest downfalls of wearing a mask -you use glasses - is how much your lenses fog up and hamper your vision. Taking off your glasses to wipe them clean each time it fogs up is not only frustrating, but it can also increase the risk of infection. So the key is to prevent or minimise fogging due to face masks.  Here’s the science behind why your lenses fog up and some tricks to stop it. Why do your glasses fog when you wear masks  The science behind fogging is simple. It’s caused by the dference in temperatures between our breath, our lenses and the environment. The air we breathe our has water molecules which are forced up through poorly fitted masks onto the lenses of our glasses. Since the air we exhale is usually warmer than the temperature of our glasses, it causes the air to condense onto to our lenses and fog them up. Ways to prevent your glasses from fogging up There are several tips and tricks to stop your glasses from fogging. These are five of the top tips. Twisting your mask straps One of the hacks that has been seen around the internet to prevent foggy lenses is twisting your mask straps once before wearing them and tucking them behind the ears. From the side, once you twist it, the elastics will look like the figure eight. This is great for stopping fogging because it redirects your breath by putting slight downward pressure on the top part of the mask. Though, itaposs worth noting that it does create a slight gap between the mask and your face that may leave you vulnerable. Adjust your nose wires A nose wire helps to seal the top of your mask and prevents warm air from seeping through. While most surgical masks already have built-in nose wires, you can easily make one of your own for any mask with pipe cleaners, paper clips, or jewellery wires, all of which can be secured along the mask with fabric glue. If your mask doesnapost have a nose wire and you canapost make one, you can simply secure the top and sides of your mask with surgical tape for the same protection.  Washing your glasses with soap If you wash your glasses with soap, this creates a thin film on your lenses which limits fogging. Use a fragrance-free soap and mix it with warm water. Soak your glasses in it and let it air dry. When you wear your glasses next, soap molecules on your lenses should block condensation. Itaposs bestyou let your glasses soak in overnight, butyou want to wear your glasses right away then make sure to gently wipe them with microfibre cloths, which usually come with your glasses. Use tissues You can put a tissue under the top part of the mask which will help catch air and moisture, keeping your lenses free of fog. To do this DIY trick properly, you should fold a tissue in half and place the straight edge along the bridge of your nose. Make sure you have a steady supply of tissues on hand so that you can change the tissue once it becomes damp from your breath. Change the position of your masks and glasses If you pull up your mask and draw your glasses down, it can block your breath from rising upwards. Butyou do this there are a few things to keep in mind.  Firstly, you need to make sure that your mask still covers your chin after you pull it up. And,your prescription is stronger, this trick could impact your vision and cause increased blurriness. What to look for in a face mask  While any of the above tips work great to prevent fogging, the type of mask you wear also matters. Qualities you should look for in a mask include : A seal along bridge of your nose and a close fit along the upper cheeks Adjustable nose wires and straps for a tight fit Full coverage of your chin to prevent need for repositioning when talking Straight-fold along the nose and cheek for your glasses to rest on evenly Moisture-absorbent material, but note that while masks made from light cotton or silks cause less fogging they donapost offer enough protection against Covid- Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Face MasksPublic transportCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The evidence was heard during the trial of the Duke of Yorkaposs pal in New York where she stands accused of grooming and abusing four minors. Epsteinaposs long time airman Lawrence Visoski said he was familiar with Prince Andrew when quizzed about flying the royal by defence lawyers for the British socialite. When asked by Maxwellaposs legal team: Are you familiar with Prince Andrew  Visoski replied Yes. Lawyer Christian Everdell then said: And he flew on Mr Epsteinaposs plane, right  Visoski responded, He did.  The airman became the second pilot to admit flying the Duke, , on Epsteinaposs jets. Captain Dave Rodgers has previously provided his flight logs in a civil case involving a victim of the late Wall Street financier that showed Andrew had taken several flights with the convicted sex offender. The evidence pours more pressure on the Duke to tell all he knows about Epstein as prosecutors and the FBI continue to probe the paedophileaposs sexual offending. As well as Andrew, Visoski recalled Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Chris Tucker, astronaut John Glenn and actor Kevin Spacey all as passengers. While giving evidence yesterday the pilot testied Maxwell was “number two in Epstein’s world. Visoski, who is was called by prosecutors as their first witness, recalled how the British socialite would often contact him to schedule flights for the Wall Street financier.  Maxwell, who was once Epstein’s girlfriend, has been charged with recruiting and grooming four underage girls to give him erotic massages, describing them as a ruse for sex abuse. Ms Maxwell was number two. Mr Epstein was a big number one, Visoski told jurors. She was the one that pretty much handled most of the finance, my expenses, spending in the office.” When cross-examined by Mr Everdell, Visoski said that during his near -year employment he never witnessed any sex abuse or underage girls without their parents aboard. “I never saw any sexual activity, no,” the airmen, who was gted land by Epstein at his New Mexico Ranch, told Mr Everdell. Visoski said he did not notice any underage girls without their parents on the planes including Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre and a victim identied as “Jane” at the trial. At one point Mr Everdell asked: If Mr Epstein were engaging in sex acts with underage girls he probably would have told you not to leave the cockpit, correct   Prosecutors raised an objection which Judge Alison Nathan overruled. Visoski replied: Correct. The pilot said he flew Giuffre in the mid to late s, but believed her to be a “shorter woman with dirty blonde hair.” He added he believed a passenger named aposJaneapos - one of four women accusing Maxwell of sexual abuse - was a “mature woman with some piercing powder blue eyes.” Prosecutors entered a birth certicate for Jane, whose identity is protected, into evidence under seal. Maxwell, , has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two perjury charges that will be tried at a later date. She faces up to  years in prisonconvicted on all counts. Lawyers for Maxwell have said the British socialite was being scapegoated for crimes Epstein committed. The financier died in jail in August  while awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges. Earlier yesterday, Judge Nathan said she had excused one juror from the case because his spouse had surprised him with a planned trip around the Christmas holiday.  As a result,  jurors and five alternates, instead of six, will continue hearing testimony in the expected six-week trial, which began on Monday. Visoskiaposs testimony provided jurors with a sense of the lestyle she lived between  and , the period in which prosecutors say the Brit - the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell - lured four underage girls for Epstein to abuse. The pilot said he frequently shuttled Epstein and guests between the billionaireaposs properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, Paris and Caribbean islands. In her opening statement on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Pomerantz said prosecutors would present flight logs that included the names of Maxwell and some of the alleged victims. Maxwellaposs defence attorney, Bobbi Sternheim, responded saying there was nothing inherently wrong with having private jets.

A smartphone was used to film a CCTV monitor for the -second clip which was posted to Twitter in a shocking security breach which has sparked fury among Navy chiefs.The video shows the F-B Lightning II, taxiing along the runway of the £billlion aircraft carrier as usual. However, the jet appears to struggle to accelerate on approach to the take off ramp. Crew can only watch as the jet trundles up to the edge of the ship, and straight off, into the ocean. The pilot was able to eject and his parachute can be seen floating down towards the water.  They only suffered minor injuries and were quickly recovered from the sea as the jet sank and is believed to be up to a mile underwater now. The unknown sailor recorded a copy of the CCTV footage from HMS Queen Elizabeth’s control tower in the Mediterranean Sea. The Navy confirmed the footage was genuine. The incident itself triggered a desperate underwater race to locate the wreckage of the F-B stealth jet and secure the crash site before Russian ers could get there.  Whilst the cause of the crash is still under investigation, it is believed that the red plastic rain cover for the jet was left on and sucked into an engine. After the incident a fortnight ago, the jet still remains at the bottom of the sea.Speaking to Mail Online, a source said: “What is someone doing recording that on their phone and putting it out there for everyone to speculate about  Thereaposs a trust issue here.“The crash is a sensitive matter – whoever is behind this has forgotten that... If that person is found theyaposll be in deep trouble and will lose any security clearance they have.”  The jet was one of eight British F-s aboard the carrier, and one of  owned by the UK. F-s are a US-designed cutting-edge warplane with stealth and intelligence-gathering capabilities, able to fly at supersonic speeds without being detected. Defence commentator Seb Haggart posted the video on his Twitter page. Sources told the Sun that the pilot realised that there was an issue and tried to abort take-off but could not stop the plane before the end of the runway. It is now understood that the UK is working with the US on a recovery mission to salvage the wreckage. With the US eager not to let their technology fall into Russian hands, the salvage operation is believed to involve ers, miniature submarines and inflatable bags.

As the little ones got older, Caitlyn began crawling and walking before her sister - but she was determined to help Freya do the same. Their mum has shared how through their special bond, Caitlyn helped Freya take her very first steps.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Laura, from Gainsborough, Lincs, said: Caitlyn would be crawling and walking while Freya was a few months behind and was just bum shuffling. So Caitlyn took it upon herself to help Freya along. She would constantly come and take Freyaaposs hand to support her, it was lovely to watch.Caitlyn would also bring the baby walker over to her sister for a bit more assistance with her walking and go along behind her to make sure she was okay.She totally mothered her, she still does it now.  The -year-old payroll administrator continued: Thanks to all of Caitlynaposs help and Freyaaposs determination, Freya actually started walking just before her second birthday. By having Caitlyn by her side and watching her, it definitely encouraged and inspired her because she wanted to be running around with her twin sister. Laura has also recounted her dficult journey to motherhood, explaining how during IVF the couple had two embryos to use as they werenapost suitable for freezing. To their amazement both of the embryos took and the couple was pregnant with twins.Everything was pretty straightforward and going well with the pregnancy until the mum hit the -week mark when it was discovered that there was extra fluid in Freyaaposs brain. We had a scan and it was mentioned that there could have been a chromosomal issue, but we didnapost opt for amniocentesis because of the risk of miscarriage, she said. We were told there wasnapost anything to be concerned about, but towards the end of my pregnancy, I was having scans every other day to keep an eye on the twins. At  weeks I was sent for an emergency C-section. The girls needed help with their breathing so they were taken to NICU.After giving birth we hadnapost seen the girls for eight hours, so I asked Simon to go down and check on the girls.When he arrived back he explained that there was a chance that Freya had Downaposs Syndrome as there were some markers, and the doctors wanted to do a blood test to confirm. Three days later it was confirmed that Freya had Downaposs Syndrome. Laura recalls the news being a massive shock and feeling an overwhelming rush of emotions. She admits that she didnapost know anything about the condition and was terried for the future. I started doing some research into the condition but I was scared for what I would find. I was terried of all the health implications that I thought would come with her having Downaposs Syndrome. Eventually we took the babies home and tried to get our heads around it. Simon was amazing, he was very chilled whereas I was panicking. I came across the Positive about Downaposs Syndrome group which was immensely helpful and made me realise that Freya was just a typical baby like her sister. As she got older she has physio to help her muscles and develop alongside Caitlyn. And she quickly followed in her twin sisters footsteps with Caitlynaposs regular acts of encouragement to get her sister to walk alongside her. Laura added: Freya is a lot more chilled than Caitlyn and she loves to cuddle her sister. Caitlyn is the bossy one and she tells Freya off. They have the best bond. I love hearing them giggle and babble away. I love that theyaposre going to be best friends for le. I know that Freya will always have someone there to look out for her in the future.

Isaac Mabwa, , ly imprisoned his victim with the intention of sexually assaulting her but he was stopped before he could do so by a brave have-a-go-hero who heard the womanaposs screams from an unlit car par, the court heard.Mabwa was convicted by a jury of kidnap,  imprisonment and  imprisonment with intent to commit a sexual offence earlier this year and was jailed for nine years today, My London reported. Wood Green Crown Court, sitting at Hendon Magistratesapos Court, heard Mabwa picked up the woman in a hire car as she made her way home from a night out in central London back in May .  She realised he was not a real taxi driver when he started driving in the wrong direction to her home and raised the alarm with friends by sending them her location. At one point, Mabwa stopped the car to take cocaine, the court heard, but accelerated when she tried to escape. Mabwa ignored the womanaposs pleas to take her home and, after an hour-and-a-half, pulled into a remote car park in west London. The woman sounded the horn and screamed as she tried to fight him off. She was overheard by a passerby who ran over shouting at Mabwa. He sped off and the man took a note of the registration plate, which he was able to give to police officers who quickly apprehended the driver. In a victim impact statement, the woman said: It is really hard for me to express how I feel. At first I thought time would help me deal with this incident since I consider myself psychologically strong. Since this happened I began to sleep badly. I cannot sleep for more than four hours at a time. I used to ask my friends not to leave me alone at any time. Sometimes itaposs days until I force myself to go out. I feel my legs shaking when I am alone and my breathing becomes accelerated just thinking someone could be looking at me. I have stopped working. I only go out when I run out of food. I spend most of my time alone at home where I feel calm and safe. I no longer like to be touched and I have become unloving. The court heard that Mabwa, who set up his own successful barbershop while on bail awaiting trial, had rum, condoms and baby oil in the car when he was arrested. At the trial, Mabwa insisted the pair were on a consensual joy ride and the victim had been aggressive to him when he refused to take her home. Paul Walker, defending, said Mabwa had turned to drink after the breakdown of a relationship with his childaposs mother and that was a catalyst for these offences for him. Recorder Rosamund Horwood-Smart QC explained the background and said: As she tried to contain her panic and get out of the car, you accelerated to prevent her from doing so. She texted for help and gave her location to her boyfriend and another friend. You were driving round and stopped at one stage to take cocaine. You had baby oil and condoms with you and you ignored her distress and would not let her go. The judge said that, after Mabwaaposs arrest, the victimaposs belongings were found in his car and on the ground where the struggle had taken place. The judge recommended that the member of the public who came to the womanaposs aid in the car park receive a High Sherf Award for his great public spiritedness. Mabwa, of Greenford, west London, will serve two-thirds of his sentence before he is eligible for release.

Roisin Duffy, from West Belfast, Ireland, said the family have waited two years to have her ceiling fixed after it fell through multiple times. Social rented housing provider Radius Housing has apologised for the delay. The mum-of-four was left with a black eye as she was caught unaware of the failing ceiling while washing the dishes in the kitchen.A leaky radiator also caused the living room ceiling to collapse just over two years ago, BelfastLive reports. Repairs to the property were meant to take place in  but due to the pandemic they were delayed and have not been carried out since. The delay has caused the house to develop mould and damp problems which the mum believes is affecting her and her childrenaposs health. Speaking to Belfast Live, Roisin, said: I cannot bear the thought of having to have another Christmas in a house like this. Just thinking about it has me on the edge of a breakdown, my mental health is ruined living here. We basically live our entire lives in my bedroom because of the damp. Nobody should have to live like this. It is two years since the ceiling collapsed the first time and the second time I was at the sink doing the dishes when everything fell on top of me giving me a black eye. As a result we have an exposed waste pipe above our kitchen and it was left covered in urine.  Can you imagine trying to live your le with something like this. I am trying to raise a young family and I have no kitchen that I am able to use to get kids ready for school in the morning or make tea. You are not able to do anything in the house because it will just get ruined. I have been on antibiotics constantly due to the health problems that this has given us and we have been waiting years for someone to fix this as we are not able to do it ourselves. It was meant to have been done two years ago originally but things were delayed by the pandemic and nothing has been done to sort it since. Radius Housing has apologised for the delay in repairs being carried out on the property and will be making repairs as a matter of urgency in the coming days. A spokesperson for Radius Housing said Our contractor is scheduled to visit this property to prepare it for all necessary repairs on Wednesday December . After the initial repairs were made there was a delay in undertaking the plasterwork and other remedial works due to restrictions brought on by covid and subsequently by issues accessing the property. We understand the frustration the delay in completing these repairs has brought and we apologise for that. We are ensuring that this work is being undertaken as a matter of urgency.

Dr Harries said there could be a further  “highly likely” cases.But how concerned should we be about the new coronavirus iant and could it really derail our festive plans Prof Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, has the answers…How worried should we be about the Omicron iant When any new iant of the virus that causes Covid- is identied, we don’t at first know how infectious it will be, whether it will cause a more serious illness than other iants and how well vaccines will work against it. We therefore need to be cautious and take measures to control the spread of Omicron until this information becomes available. We shouldn’t, however, become unduly anxious. I’ve heard that the iant causes more mild symptoms. Is that true andso why are we worried Some early reports from South Africa suggest that Omicron may cause a milder illness than other iants. However, we will need data from many more people infected with the Omicron iant – particularly older and clinically vulnerable people – before we can reach reliable conclusions about the severity of the illness it causes.Why are they giving more booster jabsthe new iant can evade existing vaccines Two doses of current vaccines provide good protection – and three doses provides even better protection – against the other strains of coronavirus. At present, we have no evidence the Omicron iant can evade existing vaccines. We need to continue with the booster programme as this has been very effective in keeping down the number of infections that can result in hospital admission or death. Does the new iant transmit any dferently We don’t yet have good data on whether Omicron can infect people more easily than other iants. It will gradually emerge in the coming weeks.Does it mean existing Covid treatments like the new antiviral treatments won’t work either  It is possible that some of the newer antiviral treatments won’t work aswell against Omicron as against other iants. However, this will need to be confirmed in research studies.It’s very likely, however, that antiviral treatments will still reduce the severity of illness caused by Omicron.What don’t we know about Omicron and when will we know We currently lack important information about Omicron – such as how infectious it is, whether it causes a more severe illness than other iants, how well vaccines protect against it and whether antiviral drugs will be helpful in reducing the severity of illness it causes. Research is already underway to answer all of these questions. How likely is it to affect Christmas and how We currently have a high Covid- infection rate in the UK. Fortunately, vaccines are keeping down the number of people with a more severe illness, which in turn is keeping the number of hospital admissions and deaths low. If we can get a high uptake of boosters, we should be able to have a more normal Christmas. But everyone should continue with infection control measures and not rely just on vaccination. People who are not vaccinated at allshould also come forward.Will mask wearing really stop it Masks can reduce the spread of infection – particularlya higher specication FFP mask is worn. But they work best when combined with other infection control measures such as vaccination and home-working.Will bringing forward boosters mean they’re not as efficient Bringing forward the booster to three months instead of six after people’s second vaccination won’t reduce its effectiveness in preventing serious illness. The booster dose substantially increases people’s immunity and this can help stop the Omicron iant evading our current vaccines. If the time between jabs is now three months, does that mean I’ll soon need a fourthI had my booster weeks ago The three month gap is for people who have not yet had a booster. If you have already had your booster, you won’t get a fourth dose . Those who have not yet had a booster no longer have to wait six months from their second dose and can have this earlier.What will happen in schools Many schools in England have had large Covid- outbreaks since the new school year started. It’s important that - year old children are vaccinated and also get a second vaccination once the Government has approved this. People working in schools also need to be fully vaccinated with three doses . Any child who is unwell with possible Covid- symptoms should get a PCR test and isolate until the result is back. Improving ventilation and air quality in schools is also essential to reduce the risk of infection. Could there be more travel bans If the Omicron iant spreads further, then more countries may be placed on the Red List. This can happen at very short notice, leaving travellers with the option of either cutting short their trip or facing an expensive stay in a quarantine hotel. Everyone should consider thisthey are planning an overseas trip.Where will I need to wear a face mask Face coverings will be mandatory by law in England’s shops, public transport, hairdressers, banks and post offices from am on Tuesday. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce rules.The Government has not published a full list but masks will not be mandatory in pubs and restaurants or cinemasand theatres like they were before. What are the new foreign travel rules From am on Tuesday, all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world must take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival and isolate until the result comes back negative. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Arrival from Red List countries must go into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. Those who breach isolation can be fined up to £,. When will I have to self-isolate All close contacts of suspected Omicron cases will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their jab status. People who test positive for Covid must still self-isolate for  days and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated close contacts of a Covid case must do the same, regardless of which iant they have.What are the rules in schools The Government is “strongly advising” school pupils above Year , staff and visitors to wear masks in communal areas. Local public health teams can send groups of pupils home as a last-ditch measure to stop the spread.Can Christmas parties and gatherings go ahead Yes, there is no legal restriction on Christmas parties. People do not need to wear masks or show a vaccine passport in hospitality venues.Health Minister Edward Argar said people in England can “use their judgment” about whetherto attend festive bashes this year.Will the rules be tightened further  It is possible. Boris Johnson has not yet enacted all of England’s Plan B measures, leaving vaccine passports for nightclubs and stadiums in reserve.And people have not been advised to work from home where possible, despite advice of that kind in Scotland. The PM is not planning to adopt Scotland and Wales’ plea for eight days’ isolation for travellers who enter the country, but has not ruled it out.When will they expire They will expire on December  with a review ahead of that meaning they could be strengthened for Christmas.

Today the Scottish government has announced nine people have been identied with the virus within its borders - five in the Lanarkshire area and four in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Scientists around the world are scrambling to find out whether the new iant is more dangerous and whether vaccines are effective against it.In a hastily-arranged press conference on Saturday, Boris Johnson announced a raft of measures aimed at stopping the new strain - which was first identied in South Africa - from spreading.These include compulsory PCR tests for everyone arriving in the UK, theof face masks in shops and public transport and contacts of those with the Omicron iant ordered to isolate for  days, regardless of vaccine status. Last night officials confirmed that two cases had been identied in London.The iniduals who tested positive are not connected to each other and are not linked to the previously confirmed cases. One case is located in Camden, London, and the other case is located in Wandsworth, London. Both have travel links to southern Africa. It previously emerged that a person who had been to Westminster but had since left the country, also tested positive for the iant.Yesterday The Mirror reported that the case in Essex had been linked to a primary school. Essex County Council posted on Twitter : Following further contact tracing of the known Omicron Covid- case in Brentwood, it has been confirmed that there is a link to Larchwood Primary School based in Pilgrims Hatch. Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said: It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing. Thataposs why itaposs critical that anyone with Covid- symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately. Scottish health secretary Humza Yousaf this morning said there was no established link between Cop or the South Africa rugby match and the Omicron cases.He told BBC Good Morning Scotland: Thereaposs nothing that links these cases or indeed the iant back to Cop or indeed the rugby match.He added: Thereaposs nothing that indicates these cases or this new iant has come via the rugby or Cop but that work of course is still ongoing .  Askedthe Government might tighten up England’s rules even further in the next three weeks, minister Edward Argar said: Itaposs not something Iaposm anticipating. Dr Harries said there is a current period of great uncertainty in understanding the new Omicron iant. She told BBC Breakfast the booster dose of vaccine will we hope, to some extent, counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this iant. Asked whether the UK will see ato work from home guidance, she said: The whole point about the booster programme and the introduction of mandatory face mask-wearing in enclosed public spaces is exactly to try and avoid that because weaposve made huge progress, we have great defences and, in the background, the dominant strain in the UK at the moment is very definitely Delta.  So these vaccines will help that, it will keep serious infection, serious disease and hospitalisations at bay, but we do need this time to try and understand the new iant, and we would much prefer that we have that precautionary approach and then take appropriate actions. Boris Johnson will give a Downing Street press conference this afternoon after new measures took force to tackle the Omicron iant.The Prime Minister will speak after a flurry of announcements over the weekend as scientists found  cases of the strain with more than  mutations in the UK - with more cases expected to follow.He is expected to speak about the new compulsory face mask rules which took effect in England from am today.Mr Johnson will urge people to get their booster vaccines after the rollout was extended to all over-s and the gap between second and third doses halved to three months.

It has so far caused no hospital admissions or death and he believes it could end the pandemic soonerProfessor Karl Lauterbach said Omicron is a Christmas gt Image: Action Press REX ShutterstockByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  Nov | commentsThe coronavirus pandemic could be ended sooner than first feared thanks to the Omicron iant, a leading epidemiologist has claimed.This new mutation is believed to have more milder symptoms than all previous iants and could mean coronavirus is treated more like the common cold. Statistics from South Africa, where the iant was first detected and sequenced, has shown that there have been no hospital admissions and no deaths from people with Omicron.Doctors also say people recover from it in just a few days after symptoms including tiredness, headache and muscle aches pass. South African infectious disease expert Professor Salim Abdool Karim also believes existing Covid vaccines should be “highly effective” against the Omicron iant, although we wonapost know for a few more weeks as more people become infected.  Professor Abdool Karim said: “Based on what we know and how the other iants of concern have reacted to vaccine immunity, we can expect that we will still see high effectiveness for hospitalisation and severe disease, and that protection of the vaccines is likely to remain strong.” Professor Abdool Karim, who works at South Africa’s University of KwaZulu-Natal and Columbia University in the United States, said no “red flags” had been raised so far about Omicron. Professor Karl Lauterbach, a clinical epidemiologist who wants to be Germanyaposs next health minister, has called Omicron a Christmas gt. He believes that the  mutations on the spike protein could mean it is optimised to infect people, rather than kill. He added that is in line with how most respiratory viruses evolve and is good that coronavirus has reached this point. The government was swt to act after the Omicron iant was first detected, bringing in PCR tests and self isolation rules for travellers arriving in the UK until they get a negative result.  It also made face coverings mandatory on public transport and in shops from this morning. Children in senior schools along with staff and visitors must all wear face masks in school and all people aged  and over are to be offered a Covid- booster vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has identied two further cases of the Omicron iant in England, bringing the total to five while six cases have also been identied in Scotland. Professor Paul Moss, from the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy at the University of Birmingham and a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, was askedpeople need to cancel their Christmas plans.  He told Sky News: “I don’t think we need to worry too much about that at this stage… the measures that weaposve got in place have a good chance of gaining some control here. “The two ways that we’re adopting to try and control this are: one, in behavioural change to reduce transmission: the travel restrictions more lateral flows masking. “And the second big factor is the immunity and we know that we may lose some immunity with this virus. So what is happening is we are boosting our immune levels to super-high levels with the plans that were introduced yesterday, and that should retain some protection. “What we’ve seen with Covid is that things change very rapidly. And I think we need at least three weeks to assess this.  “We need excellent epidemiology and within the laboratory people are testing the resistance of the virus against vaccinated samples. So we will need that sort of time. And we will know a lot more before Christmas.” He added: “You probably saw that the doctor in South Africa who initially identied it had seen relatively mild cases, which is very encouraging. “However, you know, that’s a much younger population. “It’s the elderly population, we need to worry about – in South Africa only % are above  years whereas we’ve got a much higher proportion.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mutant CoronavirusCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A spokesperson for the pub branded the couple “low lives” and said they had been humiliated after the footage was seen by more than , people.In the video, which was shared by the Landsowne Pub in Cardf, Wales, the CAMRA Pub of the Year , a man and a woman can be seen having a drink together. While the woman, dressed in a green jacket, polishes off her drink, the man, who is donning a hooded puffer jacket and a baseball cap, appears to scan the room to seeanyone is watching. Next, he reaches back to a windowsill to his left and swtly snatches a small potted plant from the ledge. He appears to bundle it into his coat, then leans forward in conversation with his companion again. In a not-so-subtle move, he holds a menu up on the table seemingly to hide the plant as he lts it up onto the surface and passes it to the woman, who then puts it into her coat. The woman gets up, grabs her purse and heads out of the frame, while the man necks the rest of his drink then follows her. As he also leaves the frame, the plant that was earlier moved onto the table cannot be seen. A spokesperson for the pub shared the video on social media and slammed the alleged thieves for their actions. The tweet, which appears to come from the award-winning pub’s official account, reads: Got any room left in your coat for any more of our plants  #WhyDoWeEvenBother #Scumbags. Cerys Furlong, who is described as one of the three owners of the pub by the Western Mail, also branded the alleged thieves “low lives”.According to reports fromThe Sun , pub bosses will not be pursuing any legal action.A spokesperson for The Landsowne Pub told The Sun: Weaposre not going to take it any further.

Image: Google MapsByFlorence Freeman:,  Nov A pub owner has hilariously fought back against negative reviews left by disappointed visitors. Nick George, the owner of Logan Rock Inn in Treen in Cornwall, was less than impressed when he found negative reviews left by a couple of disgruntled guests. He certainly didnapost take too kindly to the reviews of his award-winning th-century village venue and fought back at some of the reviews left on Tripadvisor. One reviewer, who gave the pub a three-star rating, stated they came across the pub with a pleasant outside sitting area and roaring fires inside but was left heartbroken when they were no vegan options on the menu. She said she askedthey could do a salad sandwich but was told no, and instead given a boring portion of unhealthy chips. The woman added: How long would it have taken the chef to whip up a salad sandwich whilst making two others for our party  My husband and our friend had enormous piles of salad as a side with their sandwiches, so there was plenty available. Next visit, I shall order a bread roll and a side salad and make my own.  In a sarky comeback, Nick responded: Hi, thanks for your recent review! I’d like to know what the member of staff looked like and what day you visited, please. That way I can get to the bottom of this issue. Also, feel free to apply for one of our  chefs jobs on offer as you seem pretty keen to work on our sandwich salad counter. In another comment, someone complained about the choice of music in the pub stating they were force-fed commercial radio, with an ad playing every  minutes. Nick then replied: My god I didn’t realise you were so precious and couldn’t handle a little bit of background noise or a little Cornish radio station, hardly a reason to write a review, my love. Thanks for your input it was really great to receive such a fantastic reply. After visiting one summer, one reviewer was taken aback by the prices of drinks complaining that £. for apostwo cokes, one Korev and a white wine spritzer was far too much. He finished his comment by stating: The food looked good but might have to sell a kidney to finance the food! This review certainly provoked Nick, who responded back stating: Wellyouaposre Cornish do you think you’d get it cheaper! What size wine did you have  Was it Chilean or New Zealand    What size coke did you have    Half pint or regular or a pint    He added: As for selling a kidney to finance the round that’s a bit OTT but obviously you don’t get out much!!

Demitri advises the Royal Family on wine pairings as well as works with Michelin-starred chefs on their menus, including Michel Roux Jr. He also spoke about how he turned into a beer sommelier for Prince Philip. It is said the Queen enjoys a few drinks during the day, including a gin and Dubonnet before lunch, a glass of sweet German wine with her dinner - and previously, a dry martini before bed.

Zoe, from Hastings, calling into James O’Brien’s LBC radio show on Thursday, said she witnessed the group blocking the leboat.She said they shouted: “‘Don’t bring any more of those home, we’re full up, that’s why we stopped our donations,’ and that kind of really horrible stuff. She added: “It was really upsetting, and you could hear the hatred in their voice.” Zoe said she was on the beach, near the harbour arm, with her boyfriend on November , when they heard the leboat station open, and assumed they had been called out.  She told LBC that as the crew pulled the boat out and were heading into the water a group of people stood directly in a line in front of the boat. Presenter O’Brien asked her: “Are you sure ” She said: “I’m absolutely sure, the police were called. It really shook me to the core and we thought of it yesterday night when we saw the news that people had passed away again [when  people drowned crossing the Channel on November ].” A spokesperson for the RNLI said: “We can confirm an incident was reported to the police. The leboat was able to launch and the station remains on service.” A spokesperson for Sussex police said: We can confirm an incident was reported to the police. The leboat was able to launch and the station remains on service. MP Nadia Whittome tweeted: “Leboat crews are volunteers who put themselves at risk to save others. “It’s shameful that people are abusing them and trying to stop their boats launching. This abuse is fuelled by sections of the media that have vilied refugees and the RNLI. “Solidarity with RNLI Hastings.”A video posted on Twitte r seemed to show the moments before the group blocked the boat, with a man being filmed shouting at the crew: “Don’t bring no more back here! That’s why we stopped our donations.”Whilst a small number in the town vocalised their opposition to helping refugees,  people gathered in Hastings for a vigil on Thursday evening for the  people who died trying to cross the Channel.  Also last week, local businesses and people helped  people who arrived on Hastings’ beaches via leboats. One group of largely men and five teenage boys, spent two days at sea in a small dinghy before Hastings RNLI saved them on November . Once brought in, they were met by police and volunteers from Hastings Supports Refugees who handed out hot drinks, food, warm clothing and blankets. Five days earlier, local businesses came together to help  people, including several children who arrived, on Hastings’ beaches.

Weather maps suggest things are set to turn very cold again with a risk of snow over higher ground in the north of the country on Wednesday night.Elsewhere, heavy rain could be accompanied by thunder and hail.  The Met Officeaposs Stephen Dixon said the weather will be turning colder from Wednesday due to a northerly wind. He added: Winds will be especially high in exposed coastal areas in the north and north-east, with gusts in excess of mph expected. The cool conditions will see some snowfall in the high ground of the far north, and generally as sleet or rain in the low ground.  That theme continues into Thursday, with a band of rain moving in from the west later in the day. Temperatures briefly hit double digits at the start of the week after freezing conditions swept the UK over the weekend. However, this will not last as another dip will come in by Wednesday night. Spokesman Oli Claydon said: The whole of the UK will turn milder. The places that will hold on to the cold air the longest will be in the southeast of the UK.  The low temperatures willon Wednesday and Thursday night. However, I donapost think it will be quite as low as we have seen before. It will still be below zero, but more like -Cor -C . Snow maps from Wxcharts suggest cm could fall in northwest Scotland on Wednesday evening. More snow is likely to fall on Thursday, with maps claiming there will be cm in central Scotland and up to cm between the Midlands and north-west England. The maps suggest northwest Scotland is set to be covered in cm of snow by early Friday. Met Office five-day weather forecast Tuesday night Rain, heavy in places, crossing many areas, accompanied by strong, possibly squally winds, especially further south and west. Clearer, somewhat colder weather following, showers focused in the west and north. Wednesday Most areas see some sunshine, especially towards the southeast, where some places dry. Heavier showers further west and north, with possible hail and thunder, increasingly wintry across Scotland. Windy, colder. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Turning colder again with wintry showers for the northeast. Mostly dry and bright where, although rain and hill snow will affect most places overnight Thursday into Friday.

Nnenna Joseph, , told MyLondon she was due to start a course at City, University of London this year but was prevented from doing so because she couldnapost pay her first tuition instalment of over £,.She was due to start her course in International Communication and Development, but she stated that the university was not willing to provide flexibility or continiue sponsoring her visa. The decision left her stranded in London and she feared she may face deportation. She said: On the first of October I lost a parent. He’s always been my shield he has a way of sorting me out, he always had a way of sorting us. Right now I feel, we all do the whole family, we’re all at that point where we’re like where is he  Why did he have to leave just right now when we need him the most   Nnenna was due to start her course on October , flying from Nigeria to the UK where she lived with her parents Joseph and Mary, and her two siblings. Sadly her father had been feeling unwell for several days but stated he was feeling better - so Nnenna caught her flight to the UK. But even before she could step foot onboard the plane, she got the heartbreaking call that her father had died. Nnenna then delayed her trip to the UK by two days after the shocking news. She was then later told she would be unable to access her tuition money from her fatheraposs account.Nnenna, who was , miles away in London, was told by her mother she had to be in Nigeria in person to access the money from the bank. But she claims the only option given by the university was pay your tuition or defer. Nnenna says she tried many times to explain to her situation but claims the university merely offered her one week to pay the tuition or face losing her course.  She added: Then after that, they said theyaposd reported me to the Home Office and disconnected my IT access. They could have at least arranged a meeting and had a conversation with me to actually seeI’m genuine or not but they didn’t do that, they just gave me one week to pay and nothing . Nnenna claims her tutors offered her support and tried to explain the situation to the registration team but they refused to change their decision. She had no family or friends in the UK and no money to support herself - and lived in fear the Home Office may attempt to deport her after the university notied them. A friend she met online kindly been paid rent for the both of them to live together. Nnenna says she has been her strength but that the situation made her feel dreadful. To gather funds, she set up a fundraiser to raise money for her tuition. Theunderstands Nnennaaposs situation has now been resolved and, as of November , she is enrolled at the university.She said: To the people who’ve already donated I want to say a very big thank you, I am very grateful, gratitude is all I have. I can’t pay anyone back all I have is gratitude and prayers. And to those who choose to donate after this I wish that God provides for them to be able to donate, and to those who are just praying for me - because it’s not just donations people are praying and wishing me well. I say a very big thank you to them, thank you to every one of you, I pray you never lose a loved one when you need them most, and you never become stranded in a place where you have no friends, no relations, no family.

I think shes incredible to still be working at , writes Jack BagleyI am an unashamed admirer of the Queen - despite our -year age gap Image: AFP Getty ImagesopinionByJack Bagley:,  Nov | commentsIn todayaposs society, a stereotypical eighteen-year-old would be clubbing and raving to the latest tunes until the early hours with a bottle of beer in hand. Whereas I love sitting down at .pm and watching the latest Coronation Street with a hot brew and a biscuit. And from one extremely British tradition to another, I am an unashamed admirer of the Queen, despite the age gap of  years .The wonderful woman is still working, which is remarkable considering some of the Prime Ministers she’s had to put up with. I was delighted to see her back to full health and out on royal duties at the recent double christening. Even though I know my admiration for Her Majesty definitely puts me in the minority for people of my age - and from the North of England - it does not mean I like her any the less because of other peopleaposs opinions. In fact, I use my teenage stubbornness to my benefit and defend her honour asshe was my grandmother that I visit every Monday after school.  I would go as far as to call myself a royalist, whose love for the royal family does not stop with the Sovereign . I remember when the Duchess of Cambridge was in labour expecting her first born, Prince George, and my family were glued to the news channel awaiting the arrival of His Royal Highness asit was a new superstar striker joining your team on Deadline Day ready to fire you to promotion.Funnily enough, that carried on for all three of Prince Williamaposs children, and will no doubt carry on in the future. We never were risky enough to put a bet on their names, but it was a sure thing they weren’t going to be Steve or John. Megxit may have had public opinion more ided than it’s been since the late s, but I wasn’t afraid to back my Queen’s corner. Using my youth to my advantage once more, I took to social media to voice my displeasure with the anti-royals. I might have got into a few disagreements with others about their opinions on the establishment, outraged by comments such as “The Queen’s old fashioned so should be binned off”.How can anyone dislike The Queen  She’s an absolute icon! Just like Phil Mitchell and Gail Platt. AndEastEnders has a pub with a Queen’s name, then the monarchy is in good company. Ultimately, the Queen is about as British as you can get these days.

And while those in rentals don’t own the house they live in, many of them will still add their own personal touches to make their stay more enjoyable. But one mum on TikTok has been left outraged after she spent a pretty penny completely redecorating her rental to make it her dream home – only to be told by her landlord that he’s kicking her out so he can sell the property on.Channay, who posts under the username @cleaningmum, said she had been handed a notice by her landlord telling her she has to be out of the property by January, even though she’s the one who did all the work on the house.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She wrote in one video: “When you’ve just spent ££££ on the house you live in for the landlord to give you a notice to leave by January. What a f***ing joke.” The clip showed off some areas of the house, looking very clean and chic with lots of grey and white furniture - a home that the likes of Mrs Hinch would surely love.And in update videos, she claimed that her landlord never kept up with any maintenance jobs on the house, so she was always left to do it herself. She added: “When your landlord doesn’t keep up with the maintenance so you do it yourself and then he puts it up for sale. F***ing great.”  Channay then said she would be “homeless” by January, as she has nowhere  to move to. The mum’s videos went viral and received mixed comments, as while some were sympathetic to her situation, others said she shouldn’t have decorated a house that wasn’t hers. One person wrote: “I thought it was common knowledge that it’s not a good idea to invest in doing up a rental... because it’s not yours.” While another disagreed, posting: “Everyone’s saying she shouldn’t have done up the house however, some people like to live comfortably regardless where they live.” As someone  said: “Take everything with you. And I mean everything that you paid for to improve the house.” And a fourth person added: “Put the house back as they left it and take everything you paid for. Because it seems to me like they wanted to sell after you already fixed the place up. Absolute rob-dogs.” What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

And while it may seem like an overly salted Bolognese is completely ruined, one mum on TikTok has unveiled a genius way to revert your mealaposs salt content. Vanessa, who posts under the username @vnklove, shared a video in which she was making a soup that she’d added too much salt to and to fix it she simply threw in one more ingredient – a potato. She wrote on the clip: “Have you ever accidentally put too much salt in your food and didn’t know what to do  I’ve got a trick for you!

That potato is going to absorb the excess salt. “Now you can serve it like nothing happened.” And Vanessa’s easy hack has people stunned, as commenters said they couldn’t wait to try out the trick for themselves the next time they cook. One person wrote: “I didn’t know this, thank you!” As another said: “Wish I would’ve seen this two nights ago, it would’ve saved my dinner!

Someone said: “I learned putting in a little sugar works too! I know it sounds weird, but it does the job with no hassle!” And someone  posted: “Just add pepper! Salt and pepper neutralise each other.” While a third added: “Or just add more liquid.” Other tips to tackle salt that people left in the comments of the video included using something acidic such as lemon juice or vinegar, while one other commenter said the potato trick also works when you’ve added too much chilli to a dish.

Showing how to do it, Sophie-Rose says: You want to look in their left eye for one second, to their lips for one-and-a-half to two seconds and then to their right eye. She continues by explaining that the direction is from your point of view, so you look left first - which actually is their right eye - down to the lips and then to the right - which will be their left eye. She adds: You want to make sure itaposs them speaking to you when you do it, itaposs probably not going to workyouaposre speaking while doing it because theyaposll be looking at your lips when theyaposre moving and not looking at your eyes which is where it kind of all stems from.

Kaavan is living the le he deserves. I’m looking forward to visiting him as soon as possible to see for myself what a dference the last year made. While Kaavan has not yet been socialised with other elephants, the team at CWS continues to monitor his development and will determinehe becomes interested in having a companion. Until then, neighbouring enclosures allow for the elephants to get used to each other’s smell and touch each other’s trunks, a friendly gesture.   years in captivity causes a lot of trauma but Kaavan is making great progress, roaming around his spacious jungle enclosure and enjoying baths in his pond. Back in the zoo in Pakistan, he was showing severe behavioural problems, shaking his head and pacing back and forth in the dreary enclosure. Kaavanaposs new home was found after conservationists and singer Cher won a legal battle to set him free.He had been stuck in deplorable conditions in Islamabadaposs Marghazar Zoo, after his mate was said to have died of sepsis in .This made him the only elephant in Pakistan and international media gave him the title of loneliest elephant in the world. His case eventually caught the attention of singer Cher who joined in the legal battle to get the zoo to release him and, after five years, the High Court of Pakistan finally agreed to release Kaavan from his cage in the zoo.  Cher even made the trip out to accompany him on the trip to his new home. Kaavan was transported from Pakistan to Siem Reap by plane and the team had to use creative techniques to ensure the process was stress-free for the elephant. Since Kavaanaposs rescue, the Islamabad High Court announced a ban on the import of new elephants into the country.  Dr Amir said: Kaavan’s rescue was an extraordinary experience. We transferred an elephant from Pakistan to Cambodia during a global pandemic, together with Cher, who helped with the rescue alongside the organisation and national authorities. I’m proud we were part of this truly unique story.

The pocket - now often omitted from newer designs - has gone unnoticed for years. And many who spotted it never realised its true purpose. But it is actually sewn in for hygiene reasons and is the gusset of the underwear.Gussets often are made with moisture-wicking breathable fabric, such as cotton, which helps to make sure your nether regions are dry and ventilated, the Daily Star reports. They also are highly absorbent and prevent friction, which can reduce the risk of infection. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, don’t provide protection against rubbing, sweat and bacteria - so the cotton insert is important. The revelation comes afterwomen also discovered the real reason why there are bows on the front of knickers .A curious Reddit asked the question in a forum: Why do so many panties have that little bow on the centre front  Where did the tradition come from  One person replied: As for the roots of the tradition  It comes from pre-elastic days, when your underthings were held in place by a bit of ribbon threaded through the eyelet lace at the tops. The little bow is where you tied that ribbon, and of course itaposs in the front because thataposs the easiest place to do something like that. However, there is even more backstory to the bow. According to another Reddit poster, women previously would have gotten up before the daylight and dressed in the dark or by candlelight. They claimed the bows helped them work out which way round their knickers were supposed to go. Today, the bows are mostly used for decorative purposes, though.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditCredit cardsUnderwear\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

November .Star stung the hosts at Cowan Park, Barrhead, with an excellent start to the match, forcing a succession of corners before the ever-dangerous Coll McCallum finished after an excellent delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes.

It initially took us away from the lakeside but it kept our dog safe from the toxic algae which we were concerned may still be present in the water. Our kids tend to vanish when we enter a wood, their laughter telling us they are playing somewhere close by but out of sight. Such was the case on this day as we meandered up the hill, exploring and admiring the views.A roe deer suddenly bolted from the undergrowth in front of us, taking us all by surprise. It must have been watching us approach, standing still and unseen in the nearby undergrowth. I wonderedwersquod have seen it at allit hadnrsquot decided to run away.Although it was late November, the tree canopy still had a patchwork of autumn colour. The colours were made more vivid when the sun began to set, casting a stream of golden rays through the wood, and for a moment making the lake sparkle. Such moments canrsquot be planned, just enjoyed and appreciated when they happen.Then we heard wild screams from the younger kids. ldquoFaery apples! was the cry. Tiny apples, the size of cherries, carpeted the ground. They had never seen such small apples and came running holding handfuls of them, wonderingthey could eat them.I explained they were crab apples, fallen from the crab apple tree which grew all twisty near the path.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot eat them raw, I explained, ldquobut you can cook them and make crab apple jelly. The moment I said that, I knew Irsquod given myself a task. ldquoCan we make it tonight  was the predictable reply.I will be honest, I have never made crab apple jelly but there is a first time for everything and so we gathered a pile of the tiny apples.We spent more than three hours exploring the wood, finally reaching the end of the lake after many detours and explorations. We took a lower path back to the car, but my we and I noticed something the kids didnrsquot: the sun was below the horizon and it would soon be dark. We hadnrsquot paid much attention to the time but the sun had given us some warning earlier on as it spread its final rays through the wood.We didnrsquot say anything lest the kids got spooked, but we tried to discreetly speed our step so we would reach the car park before it got completely dark. It wasnrsquot easy, as the kids played in the fallen leaves and explored side paths.Finally they noticed. ldquoItrsquos getting dark, one said.ldquoNo, it is dark! replied another.Indeed it was, although we could still see where we were going. The trees now had a dferent guise: dark silhouettes making eerie shapes in the imagination.Then it happened.The moon appeared in the cloudless sky, a nearly full moon, initially reddish in colour, then bright. It was a primeval experience, the lsquobeaver moonrsquo in the sky, lighting our way through an ancient wood. Our son did his best to spook his sisters with tales of werewolves but that just set off a crescendo of imitated wolf howling from them all. It certainly made them all feel much braver in the dark, moonlit wood.When we finally reached the car, I had a tinge of melancholy that we were leaving. But I was glad we had dallied and not noticed the sun disappearing. During our journey in the darkness, we could see the sky through the thinned tree branches in ways we cannot from home. The darkness played tricks on us but the wood felt enchanted most likely it really is.And that bright moon you might have seen it too. I will never tire of admiring its wonder."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupil-selected-cop26-local-champion","story":"Anya Boardman, who is in S at the Haddington secondary school, applied to

Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities. All the charities help those that need it most including refugees, children, older people and animals. The Christmas Challenge was launched in  by Sir Alec Reed, founder of Reed Recruitment.

Council will now look at ways to allocate resources to establish a new Greenway link connecting Judges Road to the proposed site for the ‘Rural Greenway Hub’ at the Auld School Site on Temple Road. Councillor Fleming said: “This would be transformational. It would be a greater use and safer use of the Country Park, Gransha Woods andEnaghLough. “Also, it would mean the site, known to people as the old school and Church site, being brought back into use. This won’t just have an effect on the locality ofStrathfoylePark but also the city and greater district.Councillor Ferguson continued: “The Lough is on my doorstep and even I don’t know its full history. It has its own eco-system. “It is a rural hub and over lockdown, many people have discovered the Lough and have used it for a number of activities. It is a very rural area and this has impacted on many residents. “We are hoping with the aspirations for theEnaghLough country park that some of these issues would be addressed. “We are asking to secure a connection from theStrathfoylegreenway to the Lough and Gransha area which would be impactful for the new houses so they could actively walk or cycle to the Lough. “It would link the moss area to, hopefully, a country hub at the old school where safe parking could be accessed. “If we were to overlook this small connection, we would be overlooking an absolute gem in the area.” The Council also hopes in time toexpand the Greenway within the district to areas such as Eglinton. Councillor Mooney added:I was struck by the work that has already gone into this concept. Thisisa rural tourism project that will seek to bring eco, adventure, cultural and rural tourism within the site.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Thisisa rural tourism project that will seek to bring eco, adventure, cultural and rural tourism within the site.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years. Due to a legal challenge, the resurfacing contracts for the council area have been delayed to next year. The pound.m resurfacing programme locally for the year up to March  had included the Clooney Road between Caw and Gransha Roundabouts, Church Street, Claudy,BarnailtRoad,Glensha neRoad,Killalooto Claudy and theArdloughRoad. As well as this, Circular Road,Creggan,PrehenPark,Le namoreRoad, Talbot Park, Maybrook Park, Larkhill,DrumleckDrive, St. Canice’s Park, Eglinton, Bluebell Hill Gardens.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Council will write toDfIfor investment in roads as a “matter of urgency.” Councillor Sandra Duffy brough the motion to Council and said that despite an allocation toDfI, with astructuralbudget of pound million, Derry roads are “not seeing the benefit of that investment”. CouncillorDuffy said that currently motorists were “dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment”. Councillor Duffy described the roads in and out ofGalliaghas “patchwork quilts that have been filled and refilled.” Councillors supported the motion with many bringing forward their constituents concerns over potholes and road conditions. Councillor McCready said: “I have been on roads in Baghdad and Kabul and the roads are in better condition than what our roads are here in Northern Ireland.” Councillor McKinney described the situation as a disgrace. He said: “There are parts of our district where the roads and the traffic system are like driving in a third world country. I have written on many occasions to the DfI roads, only to be told there are no funds. Councillor Reilly added: “All the councillors havedemonstratedthat there are issues affecting the roads in their area and that is an historical issue.” Councillor Devenney described the conditions of the roads as the worst he has seen them in at least  years. Due to a legal challenge, the resurfacing contracts for the council area have been delayed to next year. The pound.m resurfacing programme locally for the year up to March  had included the Clooney Road between Caw and Gransha Roundabouts, Church Street, Claudy,BarnailtRoad,Glensha neRoad,Killalooto Claudy and theArdloughRoad. As well as this, Circular Road,Creggan,PrehenPark,Le namoreRoad, Talbot Park, Maybrook Park, Larkhill,DrumleckDrive, St. Canice’s Park, Eglinton, Bluebell Hill Gardens.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, People Before Profit councillor, Shaun Harkin, has demanded that Prime-Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary, Priti Patel, be put up at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for their policies on immigration. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkin was speaking at the United Against Racism rally last Sunday next to the backdrop of Derrys Emigration Statues at Queens Quay that symbolise the citys own refugees who had to flee the starvation and persecution of An Gorta Moacuter in the s. Drawing parallels with those that sought refuge around the world from Ireland back then, Cllr Harkin said the  refugees who died trying to cross the English Channel last week need not have done so. Citing the British Governments immigration policies, Cllr Harkin said Mr Johnson and Ms Patel should be held accountable at the highest level for creating a culture in Britain that demonised migrants and asylum seekers. He said: “Its fitting we are gathered by the Great Hunger statues. One million people died across Ireland through starvation and disease. “They didnt need to die but did because the British government decided profits for a tiny handful of very wealthy people was more important than saving hundreds of thousands of lives. “More than one million people fled Ireland in a short number of years. They traveled by whatever means they could in complete desperation and were not welcomed with open arms wherever they arrived. “They were described as famine Irish who were swarming across seas bringing backwardness, disease and poverty. Today, we see millions of people fleeing starvation, war, crushing poverty and climate change. Its no dferent from what Irelands Great Hunger refugees faced. “People from Iraq and Afghanistan are almost always included among those fleeing and among those drowning. “Both countries were brought to ruin by US and British government disastrous wars and occupations that succeeded in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and stuffing billions in blood profits into the bank account of arms manufacturers. “In  the toddler Alan Kurdi washed up on Greek beach. The world responded with grief, with outrage and demanded action. Nothing has changed. “Boris Johnson and Priti Patel should be going to the International Criminal Court for their racist immigration policies, for their efforts to demonise migrants and asylum seekers, for their role in the death of innocent people at sea, in trucks, in freezing camps.” Cllr Harkins ire was also directed at the European Union who he accused as being equally culpable as Mr Johnson and Ms Patel. He added: “Were told over and over how progressive EU bureaucrats are. Its a myth. “Twenty seven people died in the English channel last week but nearly  people have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year already. “Nearly , have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since . This is the direct result of racist EU immigration policies. “EU bosses are spending tens of billions to strengthen Fortress Europe with surveillance, patrols and  kilometres of border walls. “Nothing has changed because the British government and EU bureaucrats prioritise upholding racist borders and the wealth of a handful of billionaires over taking real humanitarian action. “The British government and EU elites will never put humanity before billionaires, powerful corporations and war profiteers. “James Connolly, a migrant himself, opposed a border in Ireland but also opposed borders across Europe. He continues to speak for a vision directly opposed to that of elites and billionaires: “The day will come, and perhaps like a bolt from the blue, when the frontiers will not be sufficient to prevent the handclasp of friendship between the peoples. “But that day will come only when the kings and kaisers, queens and czars, financiers and capitalists who now oppress humanity will be hurled from their place and power. “And the emancipated workers of the earth, no longer the blind instruments of rich men’s greed will found a new society, a new civilisation, whose corner stone will be labour, whose inspiring principle will be justice, whose limits humanity alone can bound. “If we want to end English Channel and Mediterranean Sea drowning tragedies this is what we need to aspire to do.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

Cllr Duffy who is Sinn Feacuteins local health spokesperson and also represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the JCVIs recommendation was welcome but it was vital that current health advice on mask wearing be adhered to in order to enhance the protection given by the booster. She said: “The announcement that the booster vaccine programme has been extended to include younger people is very welcome. “The COVID booster vaccination has been shown to be highly effective at preventing serious illness and the spread of the virus. “It is also notable that the gap between the second and third dose is to be cut to three months in an effort to stymie the further spread of COVID-. “While these measures are welcome it must be remembered that vaccines are but one tool in the kit. “It is vital that the Department of Health have an optimal level of testing and tracing in constant operation and that we all observe public health advice on hygiene and mask wearing. “Together all these tools can work to keep us safe and to reduce the pressures being endured by our health and social care workers.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

A number of questions were asked of respondents – one of which enquired about bullying in the workplace to which  per cent replied that they had been a victim of it. Other figures made for disturbing reading as well with  per cent saying that when off work for illness, they get no sick pay from their employer and have to rely on the governments statutory sick pay – a rate signicantly lower than their monthly wage. A further  per cent said they were struggling to pay their household bills while  per cent said their workforce was not friendly towards trade unions. DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling

DTUC Chairperson, Niall McCarroll said: “Derry Trades Union Council through this local workers survey, have provided an opportunity, a  and a voice for workers to have their say, local workers have now spoken. “The political classes and the bosses must now act to address the exploitation and undervaluing of our young people and the wider local labour force. “The local chambers of commerce must now also take on the responsibility, with others, of reversing years of wage inequalities and hardships, which have been created through profit driven local employment practices. “A local culture within our employment market which has derisory and insulting take home pay as fundamental to its existence, leaving local workers barely able to survive. “When it comes to telling us, what’s best for local people and what we need to improve and advance like other city’s, local business leaders, the council and other departments of a refined nature, regularly bestow upon us their collective unity of purpose, an unquestionable expertise. “In the knowledge that  per cent of local workers have experienced bullying and or harassment in the workplace and  per cent struggle to pay their bills, their message grows weak and lacks credibility, as they continue to profit and feed off grandiose statements. “Sixty nine per cent of local workers surveyed were women with  per cent of those surveyed earning below pound. per hour for their labour and  per cent gained employment under zero hours contracts, conditions stacked in favour of the rich and the business classes. “The laughter of our children is being muffled by local capitalists, we should not accept any young person being paid pound. an hour. Local businesses should be asked and make it known, how much they pay their workers and in turn we decide where we spend our money. “Pay rates should be listed on such things as restaurant menus, front doors of public houses and every retail outlet in shopping centres. “Forty eight per cent of local workers who completed the survey were employed in retail or the hospitality and tourism sectors with  per cent being left with no option but to use a food bank. “It would be disappointing and unjustied to think that local workers received such pittance during such times as the Fleadh Cheoil, City of Culture, Clipper Festival and other boom times for business and commerce groups. “Poverty pay and precarious working conditions suit our business leaders and creates the ideal environment to promote investment, come to Derry and you will have cheap labour at your disposal and a workforce which is largely non unionised and therefore not organised to challenge wage inequalities, voiceless. “Sixty five per cent of local workers surveyed said their workplace was not trade union friendly, this needs called out and challenged politically. “As a guiding principle, moving forward, every worker across the city and district should have unhindered access to the trade union of their choice and encouraged to organise and become active in that trade union. “We read regularly that our health and social care system is overstretched, the AE at Altnagelvin Hospital being unable to cope with demand, we have a mental health crisis, young people with a sense of hopelessness no future no vision, with local communities having some of the highest statistics in terms of social deprivation and poverty. “The link between substandard contracts of employment, poverty pay and socio economic hardships is well researched, poor terms and conditions of employment is putting pressure on our health service and working class communities. “Sixty seven per cent of local workers surveyed had no company sick pay and  per cent were unable to self isolate due to Covid- because they could not afford financially to do so. “The findings of this survey are stark and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, these findings must now be incorporated into any future party political election manestos and a central focus of any corporate plan from Derry City and Strabane District Council. “Our livelihoods and prosperity are of course important but we must also reconcile this with our identity, who we are and what we cherish the most.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling

Nor can we expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise of a just transition. It recognises no borders. “Society across this island is demanding a robust response to the crisis we face and it is just common sense that it should be organised on an all-Ireland basis.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City!

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There was quite the dference between the team which started the campaign, and that which ended the season in fourth place – both in terms of personnel and belief and suddenly Derry City fans are looking towards  with great excitement. There were moments of great excitement, and others of great disappointment, but finally there seems to be a real direction about the club and the  campaign could well be looked on as the year that things finally started to change for the better at the Brandywell. Derry News Sports Editor Gary Ferry looks back on a memorable season and hands out the awards for those Derry City players who have really caught the eye in .   PLAYER OF THE SEASON RONAN BOYCE There have been some stand-out performers this season. Joe Thomson has come into his own, Ciaron Harkin has been back to his best, and Jamie McGonigle has been a revelation. But Ronan Boyce has been the stand-out by far. The -year-old broke through to the first team and became a regular this season, first appearing as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and going on to make  starts and  substitute appearances. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but came into his own this season and scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell in April. That was a real sign of things to come and the defender went on to score six more times, with goals against Waterford, St. Patrick’s Athletic, Sligo Rovers , Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians. The youngster’s goals were very often crucial to the team, with his seven goals earning the Candystripes seven points in all.  GOAL OF THE SEASON JAMIE McGONIGLE VS. BOHEMIANS If any game stood out for Derry City this season, then it was surely the - draw against Bohemians at Dalymount Park in September. Trailing - at half time, Derry City responded with a sensational display of attacking football in the second half. The equaliser which brought them back into the game was out of this world, as Jamie McGonigle collected a pass from Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, approached the Bohs penalty area from the left wing before curling the ball exquisitely around the defender past James Talbot into the top corner. It was enough to make Ruaidhri Higgins and everyone on the bench race onto the pitch in celebration and was a goal which deserved to win any game. Two Four goals followed that strike as a Georgie Kelly worldie deep in added time denied Derry the win, and ensured the first - league draw in  years but that goal from McGonigle has not been forgotten.  MOST IMPROVED PLAYER JOE THOMSON Since Ruaidhri Higgins has come in as manager, Joe Thomson has really stood up to prove invaluable in the Derry City midfield. His battling qualities, as well as his passing and ability to transition from defence to attack has really made him stand out this year, making  starts and  substitute appearances in all competitions. But it is his ability to shoot which has taken him to another level. He doubled his goal tally this year, scoring four times, against St. Patrick’s Athletic, Waterford, Sligo Rovers and Finn Harps, and some of them were absolute belters. He also chipped in with five assists and unsurprisingly signed a new deal recently to keep him at the club next season.  BEST NEW SIGNING JAMIE McGONIGLE Since joining Derry City in June, Jamie McGonigle has proved just why Ruaidhri Higgins is such a huge fan. After a stop-start beginning to his le as a Candystripe, McGonigle has been superb. Be it his incredible goal against Bohemians, or his late penalty against Finn Harps, McGonigle has proved that he is the big man for big moments. He has already scored two winners against Dundalk, and scored four goals in his last three games to finish as Derry’s top scorer with  goals, even though he joined in mid-season. In  appearances, he has provided  goals and  assists, and with a good pre-season in the coming months, he could be unstoppable next year.  BEST MOMENT OF THE SEASON BEATING DUNDALK AT LAST It might not have been the greatest game, but the victory over Dundalk on August  was long, long, long overdue. Derry City had suffered against the Lilywhites for close to a decade, and any type of win was needed just to get that monkey off our backs. It came as a result of a Jamie McGonigle penalty, and also gave Derry a win over one of the so-called big teams in quite a while. It was the first Brandywell victory over Dundalk since October, , when a Derry City team which included Ruaidhri Higgins won -. That win gave City some real belief and they followed that up with their first win at Oriel Park since  by winning - on the final day of the season to secure fourth place.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Written by Johnny Gogan and Brian Leyden and directed by Gogan, the film was produced by Dromahair-based Bandit Films. The film was scored by Sligo’s Glenn Garrett, edited by Dromahair-based Patrick O’Rourke and shot by Strandhill videographer Peter Martin. Black Ice tells the story of Alicewho is drawn into the clandestine boy - and girl - racing scene where Jimmyis considered top dog among the petrol heads in a fictional Donegal border community. Their relationship and their attempts to get into the legitimate rallying scene are undermined by forces at work in this shadowy border world threatening their ambition, the town where they live and, ultimately, Alice’s family. Black Ice received a wide release in Ireland in  and was one of the best Irish performers at the box office and on DVD that year. The film received repeat broadcasts on RTEacute. The film’s release on Netflix follows the recent release of Johnny Gogan’s feature documentary Hubert Butler Witness to the Future on the streaming service. The film will now be available - in multiple languages - across Netflix’ European network Johnny Gogan s to Donegal for the commencement of his new novel Station to Station. The pacy thriller about a rogue Irish diplomat commences and revisits at ious points in the narrative, Donegal’s Lough Derg pilgrimage island. Station to Station which featured at the recent Allingham Festival is centred around the uncovering of the corruption around a rather unique Irish-Spanish property deal on the south coast of Spain. Published by Lepus Print, the book is available through independent book shops in Donegal and nationally. Johnny Gogan’s other feature drama work includes The Bargain Shop , The Last Bus Home , Mapmakerand the drama-documentary Prisoners of the Moon . The release of his feature documentary Groundswell earlier this year was welcomed by ’s Chief Film Critic Peter Bradshaw as “a lesson to communities there and everywhere  to stay vigilant”.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSudden deaths in County Derry town ‘not suspicious’. overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City have bounced back to qualy for Europa after a dismal start to the  seasonSportTheres never a dull moment at Derry City! overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tenant Moira Deeney pictured in the new fitted kitchen in her Gartan Square home withHousing Executive patch manager Catherine Curran, Curran, in her new fitted kitchen at Gartan Square, Derry.Derry NewsHousing Executive cooks up pound, for kitchen replacements for tenants in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Cllr Brian Tierney: Unbelievably this is the second incident of this nature within the last five years and we canrsquot afford to see another one.Local NewsCouncillor calls for action as residents narrowly escape second car crash into their Oakgrove home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

Booster vaccination can now be given from three months of completion of the primary course.Welcoming the expansion, Mr. Swann said: ldquoOur booster programme will now in many ways mirror the primary dose vaccination programme which steadily moved its way down through the dferent age groups over a number of months.ldquoI would again urge people not to be put off getting their first, second or booster doses due to concerns or speculation about the Omicron iant.ldquoIt remains very likely that vaccination will continue to protect against severe illness from Omicron as it does against other iants of SARS-CoV-.ldquoIn addition, our vaccines provide very good protection against the Delta iant, which remains the predominant strain in Northern Ireland at this point.The Minister revealed details of Health Trust vaccination hubs and clinics that are opening this week across Northern Ireland, complementing the ongoing vaccination work of GPs and local pharmacies, signicantly increasing the systemrsquos capacity to deliver boosters.In addition, the pharmacy sector is finalising plans for a special weekend of additional walk-in booster vaccination clinics this Saturday and Sunday .In the first instance, most Trust vaccination hubs and clinics will principally focus on boosters for the over-s.Anyone in this category should be called by their GP but can also attend Community Pharmacy or Trust Centresthey have not yet received their booster.Trust centres are also providing ongoing first- and second-doses for all eligible age groups and will open soon to the - year olds for their booster doses.People in the -plus age range now have a choice of waiting to be invited in by their GP for their booster, or going to a local pharmacy or the Trust Centres.The ision of roles between the vaccine providers will be kept under ongoing review and is likely to be updated in the coming weeks.Most Trust vaccination hubs are offering both walk-in and booked appointments. Bookings can be made online athttps:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated .A list of pharmacies offering the booster jab is available on the Health and Social Care Board website, atwww.hscboard.hscni.net booster-covid-vaccination  .December -Lakeland Forum, EnniskillenDecember -Omagh Leisure Centre, OmaghCentres will be open seven days a week, am-.pm each day except for Mondays and Thursdays, when they will instead open from noon to pm to facilitate evening appointments.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sir Keir was wisely quieter on that, given the millions that have been spent on that one case and the hundreds of terrorist murders have had little or no scrutiny.Last week, Ms Haigh said that she would not campaign for NI to stay in the UK in any border poll, contradicting his own position.

Ms Cooper, a former cabinet minister and the current chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, becomes shadow home secretary and will take on Priti Patel over the migrant crisis.Sir Keir also handed big promotions to two of Labour’s rising stars, Bridget Phillipson and Wes Streeting, who take on the roles of shadow education secretary and shadow health secretary.Jonathan Ashworth, who has had the health brief through the pandemic, is moved to shadow work and pensions secretary.In other moves, Lisa Nandy will face off against Michael Gove as shadow secretary for levelling up and communities. She will be replaced as shadow foreign secretary by David Lammy.Former leader Ed Miliband becomes shadow climate change secretary, while Jonathan Reynolds takes on his former portfolio of business, energy and industrial strategy.“With this reshuffle we are a smaller, more focused shadow cabinet that mirrors the shape of the Government we are shadowing,” he said.“We must hold the Conservative Government to account on behalf of the public and demonstrate that we are the right choice to form the next government.”Earlier it appeared the reshuffle would be overshadowed as tensions resurfaced between Sir Keir and his deputy, Angela Rayner.Ms Rayner appeared to be blindsided when news of the reshuffle broke, as she was delivering a keynote speech on Labour’s plans for reforming standards in public le.“I don’t know the details of the reshuffle or the timing of it,” she said in response to reporters’ questions.“I’ve been here concentrating on my role now, but six months ago I said again, we need some consistency in how we’re approaching things as an opposition.”A spokesman for Ms Rayner later said the leader and his deputy had spoken between her morning round of media interviews and her speech at the Institute for Government .Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was shadow home secretary, takes on international trade in what is ostensibly a demotion.However Sir Keir softened the blow by announcing that he had asked him to head a new shadow cabinet committee leading the party’s response on Brexit.Elsewhere, Lucy Powell becomes shadow culture secretary, Jim McMahon gets environment and Steve Reed goes to justice.The veteran former minister Pat McFadden becomes shadow treasury chief secretary while former leadership contender Emily Thornberry is the shadow attorney general. Jo Stevens becomes shadow Welsh secretary.Those leaving include the former shadow education secretary Kate Green, the former shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard and the Blair-era veteran Lord Falconer, who announced he was stepping down as shadow attorney general.Earlier, Cat Smith, who was shadow minister for young people and one of the last acolytes of Jeremy Corbyn on the Labour frontbench, announced she was quitting, citing the continued withholding of the Labour whip from the former leader.“This position is utterly unsustainable and it is important that you truly understand how much damage this is causing in constituency Labour parties and amongst ordinary members, a number of whom are no longer campaigning.” she wrote in her letter of resignation.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, party chair Anneliese Dodds and shadow defence secretary John Healey are among those remaining in their current posts.In a statement, Sir Keir said: “I want to thank all those who have left the shadow cabinet today for their great service to me and to our party.“I look forward to working with the new team to show we are once again a serious party of Government, ready to fix the mess the Tories have got the country into and to inspire voters to believe that Britain’s best days are ahead of us.”Labour Party Northern Ireland spokeswoman under fire for saying she would not argue for NI’s place in the UK in a border pollPeter Hain backs Louise Haigh over position on NI’s status——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That’s the appeal to the public from Health Minister Robin Swann, as public health measures are activated in response to the Omicron iant’s emergence. Mr Swann also underlined the continuing importance of vaccination in the battle against all strains of the virus. “Subject to the Speaker’s approval, I intend to update the Assembly on Monday in regard to the measures being deployed in response to the emergence of the Omicron iant,” the Minister said. “These include the addition of a number of countries to Northern Ireland’s Red List for international travel. “The emerging picture on the Omicron iant is being very closely monitored and we will continue to liaise with public health colleagues in the other UK jurisdictions and the Irish Republic.” The Minister urged everyone to adhere to the basic steps that will help stop the spread of all iants of COVID-. These include: getting vaccinated and getting your booster dose when eligible, wearing a face covering, limiting contacts, keeping rooms well-ventilated or meeting outdoors when possible, working from homepossible, and practising good hand hygiene. If you have symptoms of COVID- – a high temperature OR a new, continuous cough OR a loss of or change in sense of smell, or taste, no matter how mild – please isolate and get a PCR test as soon as possible. The Health Minister continued: “There are concerns that the Omicron iant may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines. That is not confirmed and it is important to emphasise that. “Furthermore, eventhis does turn out to be the case, it remains vital that as many people as possible get their first and second doses and their booster vaccines when eligible. “I have been assured that our vaccines should still provide a level of protection against Omicron. The importance of that cannot be overestimated. Secondly, we know that our vaccines are very effective against the Delta iant. Delta very much remains the predominant iant in NI at the current time, is a very real and present risk to our population, and is continuing to cause serious illness and, in some tragic cases, death to our fellow citizens.” Mr Swann continued: “Plans have been activated to identy any spread of the new iant in NI. “Using passenger locator data, the Public Health Agency is identying and contacting iniduals who have recently arrived in Northern Ireland from Red List countries. “They and their household members will be asked to self-isolate and undertake PCR tests. If any positive cases are detected, the sample will then undergo Whole Genome Sequencingto determine the iant type. If the new iant is confirmed here, all appropriate health protection actions will be carried out and the public will be informed as appropriate.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caedcbcaaabdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638199683305.jpg--covid_19___mon_29th_november_figures.jpg?163819968300","title":"covid  mon th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
