It’s a highly effective, visible deterrent to bike thieves. They know that if they are caught with a registered bike, the owner can be traced and they will be arrested. \u0027Remember to record details of your bike such as the frame number (normally found underneath the bike between the pedals or where the back wheel slots in), the BikeRegister number plus any other distinguishing features, and take a photo.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle urged Royal family members return abroad","story":"Celebrate Christmas the royal way in Archie\u0026#39s Boden jumperClick here to buyFinally, the Sussex’s have revealed their Christmas card, and we certainly weren’t disappointed.Although we haven’t seen much of little Archie Mountbatten-Windsor since his arrival in May, he was the main attraction for the royal card this year.From what we have seen of the little royal we know that mum Meghan knows a thing or two about kidswear and for this snap has even kept to the British high street by dressing him in a knitted jumper by Boden.Crafted from a snuggly cashmere in classic grey marl, the jumper is designed with a polar bear on the front and button detailing for easy dressing whilst your little one wriggles around.Fortunately, it’s still available to buy, but no doubt it’ll sell out fast so click (right) to shop.

There are some, Cameron Newham admits, who may consider him an “eccentric weirdo”.So how would he describe the remarkable ambition that he set for himself, more than two decades ago, to photograph, in detail, every parish church in England?“I think everybody has a certain eccentricity – and this does require that,” he says with a smile. “I do have a particular mission for this. But even so I am not all-consumed by it.”Now, after 9,000 churches and more than half a million photos, the Australian is entering the final phase of the project, with a mere 1,500 more churches still to photograph, which he hopes to complete within three years. The ambition is to make the images available through an app, which he has developed himself, as part of what he calls his “gift to the future”.Church attendance may be continuing to fall in the UK, but for more than a millennium, in towns, villages and hamlets across Britain, parish churches have been the focus of community life. Some are richly adorned architectural wonders, some simple buildings that have been patched up repeatedly over centuries. Newham’s app, when he completes it, will provide the most comprehensive photographic archive ever compiled of a collection of buildings that are considered the nation’s greatest treasures.It is almost 23 years since Newham embarked on his project, in the spring of 1997, having moved to Britain from Perth the previous year. An IT professional with an interest in historic buildings, he had been collecting some of the famous mid-20th century guides to historic English buildings written by Nicolaus Pevsner, but was disappointed that the number of photographs in each was limited.“You are left wondering what some of these buildings look like. So I bought a little digital camera and I thought I would go out at the weekend and take three pictures of each.”The initial plan was just for a few snapshots, but as memory card capacity rapidly increased, he thought he would include all exteriors, then all internal monuments prior to 1900, and so on. He doesn’t photograph everything – bells, organs and church chests don’t interest him – but as his Instagram feed shows, that allows for a dizzying array of fonts, tombs, monuments, wall paintings and stained glass.Largely self-taught, he has developed a technique using photogrammetry – stitching together multiple snaps – to build up striking images of tomb monuments that make them easier to visualise than in the flesh. Several academics have already commissioned him to focus on particular details that illuminate areas of their research, including into medieval armoury or particular sculptors.Unmarried and now in his mid 50s, Newham has sacrificed weekends and holidays trekking around churches – at one point taking 18 months off work “to do Cornwall and Devon – all 847 of them”. On a good day, at the height of summer and if the keyholders are obliging, he can fit in 12 churches in a day, taking somewhere around 50 pictures in each.As a rule, Newham doesn’t formally ask permission before visiting – “nobody actually knows who actually owns these churches” –but finds most church wardens or vicars are curious and grateful. (A second app, already up and running, contains details on keyholders and whether churches are open or locked.)The obvious question, however, is why a man who describes himself as “not English, not an architectural historian and not a photographer” – and also not religious – would do this.“I thought, this is … a grand way of projecting myself into the future after I’m long gone. People will look at these photographs maybe in 100 years, maybe in 500 years, and it’s my connection to the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f914d23cfb81f229e28135fe09d4261edafa78/0_0_8256_5504/master/8256.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8d1988809eefa43273f551d3e203004 720w","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

Against the backdrop of easing tensions, the FTSE 100 has risen by more than 300 points in the past month and stands at about 7,600. Shares in major British companies, including banks, housebuilders and utility firms that faced the prospect of nationalisation under Labour, also rallied strongly after Johnson’s election victory.British companies rushing to stockpile imports in the buildup to the previous October Brexit deadline caused Britain’s trade deficit to widen over the month. The shortfall between the value of goods and services sold abroad and imported to the UK increased by about £3bn on the previous month to reach £14.5bn in October, amid a surge in imports before the Halloween deadline. The trade in goods deficit, excluding services, rose from £1.9bn in September to £5.2bn, above the consensus estimate of City economists for an increase to £3bn. Analysts said that underlying demand for UK exports remained depressed by the uncertainty over Brexit, with some overseas companies shunning the UK, given the lack of clarity over the future trading relationship with the EU.House prices across Britain dropped by the most in November for seven months, in a sign that Brexit and election uncertainty was weighing on the minds of buyers and sellers, a closely watched barometer of the property market showed. The gauge from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors – which shows the difference between its members reporting price rises and falls – declined to -12 in November from -5 a month earlier, missing the forecasts of City economists. The UK housing market has cooled since the Brexit vote, with prices falling on an annual basis in London and some surrounding areas. Prices have continued to rise in the Midlands and the north of England.Brexit and austerity were the two major factors framing the 2019 election. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, day-to-day public spending on services was set to rise to above 2010 levels regardless of which party won the election, in a sign of a growing political consensus on the need to end the past decade of austerity. However, it found that day-to-day spending – excluding health – would not return to above its 2010 peak, warning that austerity was essentially still “baked in” to the new government’s plans. The country’s leading tax and spending thinktank said that neither Labour’s nor the Conservatives’ plans were credible, as they reinforced a message that spending could rise without tax-raising measures to pay for them. It warned that the Tories promising to exit the transition period at the end of 2020 with or without a trade deal with the EU could damage the public finances and the UK economy.

We may well see a welcome return to record pay levels, but a less welcome retreat from record employment, with worrying signs including falling vacancies and rising youth unemployment.“Policymakers focus on the underlying problem – an economy growing slowly because businesses aren’t investing. This received next to zero discussion during the election campaign, but putting it centre stage should be a new year’s resolution for all of us.”On several indices, however, the authors predicted the boost to living standards could run out of steam. It said firms were wary, with businesses in 2019 looking to employ fewer workers, and surveys showed more than twice as many people expected unemployment to rise next year as did in 2017.Gaps in employment rates between regions have widened, with the north-east of England now about 10 percentage points lower than the south-west.Meanwhile, although the rate of decline in vacancies in 2018 was below the level that would trigger a recession, the trend was “reasonably large” – the biggest since the crisis – and enough to suggest a turning point in the labour market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeae6c07ca636ac4898e37b867cb570a1b84123b/0_173_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3678d206762e39295087421397b6ee4a","title":"anonymous confessions google form","story":"It was my friend Chris who started me off.

That case was argued, for example, by Kenan Malik in his 2008 book Strange Fruit, and it is presented, too, in Angela Saini’s Superior (which I reviewed for the  in July), a popular choice on many “books of the year” lists.I used to be sceptical about this claim. I have all the liberal lefty’s revulsion at racism, but I couldn’t help thinking: “If we insist that race is not biologically determined, won’t that just confuse people, given that it is so blindingly obvious that characteristic markers of race are inherited?” The usual argument is that genomics has identified no clusters of gene variants specific to conventional racial groupings: there is more genetic variation within such groups than between them. But doesn’t that insist on a definition of race that most people simply won’t recognise? Isn’t it better to say that yes, race has a biological basis – but the relevant bodily features are a trivial part of what makes us us?I confess that I was too nervous to make this suggestion in such an incendiary area. Fortunately, after reading Saini’s book I no longer need to, for Superior gave me the perspective I needed to see what is wrong with it. Our concept of race is not really about skin colour or eye shape, and never has been. It has baked into it beliefs that can’t be dispelled merely by reducing its biological correlates to trivialities. For in our assumptions about race, those features have always been rather irrelevant in themselves. Rather, they serve to activate prejudices stemming from deeply ingrained cognitive habits.Saini shows that what we have understood by race encodes the belief that literally superficial aspects of our appearance act as markers for innate differences we can’t see. And here’s the problem: it does so for good reason. In times past, and sometimes still today, the strong correlation between your appearance and your culture meant that visual differences really could act as proxies for certain differences in attitudes, traditions and beliefs.Our brains are exquisitely adapted to pick up on such correlations – and, unfortunately in this case, to conclude that they are causative. We instinctively assume that differences in behaviour that are in fact due to culture must be linked to – even caused by – characteristics of appearance. That is what the traditional notion of race is all about. But genetics has found no such innate origins of behavioural differences between “races” – and it is highly unlikely, given what we know about genetic variation, that it would.So the notion of race depends on cultural difference – yes, it is a social construct – yet our brains intuitively insist that biology must play a role. In short, we shouldn’t fool ourselves that it’s easy to realign our perceptions here. To confuse us further, while Saini points out that not all the medical correlations of disease and susceptibility with race are as robust as often assumed (not least because race can become entrained with socioeconomic status), some are undeniable. For example, people from Asia are much more likely to be lactose-intolerant than people of European heritage. But what our brains find so hard to process is that no one is lactose-intolerant because they are Chinese. We’re not cognitively well equipped to develop the right intuitions here.It is probably showing white supremacists (from whom I heard a little after my review) more charity than they deserve to say that they’re caught up in the same confusion. There’s more to their delusions than that, however. Their brains are exercising another of its perilous adaptations: the tendency to find ways of rationalising what it suits us to believe.This confusion persists, however, even among geneticists, biologists and doctors who we might expect to be better informed on such matters, for whom the use of “race” as a crude predictive tool can distort expectations and reinforce false assumptions about what it really means. We all have those corner-cutting brains.I always knew at some level that race is an inference about traits based on appearance. But finding the right way to articulate it has made me appreciate that it is much harder to “see beyond” at the subconscious level. Rationalising and good intentions aren’t enough this is about undoing a habit of mind. Still, my own experience in a multiracial family persuades me it can be done.It’s a bit painful and embarrassing to admit my past misconception, not least because it could expose me to the understandably exasperated response: duh, white dude finally gets it. It also suggests that there is no tidy, comfortable story we can tell ourselves that dismisses the complexities and even the contradictions of race. Sure, this habit is not unique to white folks (as Saini illustrates) – but so what? My own task is to recognise how it manifests in myself and in a culture that confers privilege on me as a result. I’ll ignore sneers of “white guilt” I see instead a duty to listen and learn, and a readiness to accept that I might still get it wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8239ae962365befe614538d750fc0601c700af83/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5206790161e5a210cfb544747d3d8b01","title":"my love letter to britain family ties","story":"Since I went to a British school, you have always been part of me. Now you are leaving, and it breaks my heartMore than 40 years have passed since then. So much has happened. My family went back to the Netherlands, I studied there and in France. I got married and became a father, did my military service, worked as a diplomat, orced and married again, got elected to parliament, served in government and am now in the European commission. Britain was always there. As part of me. Being in one of your schools made me more Dutch than before. Because there is no better way to be made aware of your own culture than by being immersed in another. And at the same time, that immersion leaves traces. What you inhale and absorb remains: as an extra layer, a sediment that partly merged with what was already there and partly remains distinguishable and unique.I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I’m like an old lover. I know your strengths and weaknesses. I know you can be generous but also miserly. I know you believe yourself to be unique and different. And of course you are in many ways, but perhaps less than you think. You will never stop referring to the rest of us as “the continent”. It helps you to create the distance you think you need. But it also prevents you from seeing that we all need a bit of distance between us. All European nations are unique. Our differences are a source of admiration, surprise, discomfort, misunderstanding, ridicule, caricature and, yes, love.In the best of times these differences make us the most creative, productive, peaceful and prosperous of families. In the worst of times our differences are manipulated to instil fear, to propagate superiority, to set one family member against the other. Things then quickly get out of hand. We all are also very, very good at that. That is our legacy. That too is who we are. And as a family we have a duty to promote the best of times and keep the worst of times at bay. So far, for all its faults, the EU has been the most successful tool to achieve that goal.You have decided to leave. It breaks my heart, but I respect that decision. You were in two minds about it, like you have always been in two minds about the EU. I wish you had stuck to that attitude, it served you well and it kept all of us in better shape. Was it necessary to force the issue? Not at all. But you did. And the sad thing is, I see it is hurting you. Because the two minds will still be there, even after you have left. In the process so much unnecessary damage has been done to you, and all of us. And I fear more will follow.Truth be told, I felt deeply hurt when you decided to leave. Three years later I am just sad that a member of our family wants to sever our ties. But at the same time I find comfort in the thought that family ties can never really be severed.

Today we look at the changing shape of car cultureLewis Hamilton’s recent declaration of support for climate action attracted derision as well as plaudits. “I like fuel. Can I say that? I don’t like electric stuff,” was the deliberately provocative response from a fellow Formula One driver, Max Verstappen. But the sport is officially on Mr Hamilton’s side. In November it announced a net-zero carbon target of 2030.In planning to eliminate most of the carbon emissions for which it is responsible, and offset the rest, F1 is part of a growing movement. The most recent round of United Nations climate negotiations may have ended in disappointment. But the past 12 months have undeniably seen a global surge in public awareness and activism on climate issues. Even Jeremy Clarkson, the television presenter and anti-environmental journalist, admitted the danger of global heating in a public statement last month. While filming a journey from Cambodia to Vietnam for his TV show, The Grand Tour, he saw for himself the impact of water shortages on a dried-up riverbed and admitted to being alarmed.Since the automobile industry’s earliest days, motor sports have served both as a laboratory and a showcase. While advances were once focused on speed, design and safety, energy could be viewed as just another challenge. But should we embrace “electric stuff”, or other alternatives to petrol, as the automotive future?An electric future?Driving enthusiasts and industry champions, including governments, naturally welcome these developments. For authorities struggling with high levels of air pollution as well as emissions targets, there is no doubt that electric vehicles represent an improvement, especially when they replace older vehicles and SUVs. For decades, petrol pumps have been the most direct point of contact between people and the oil industry. To anyone who seeks to weaken the hold of these powerful businesses, breaking these bonds feels like progress.But is it enough to wean drivers off petrol and diesel? Or could 21st-century transport be more radically reconfigured in such a way as to reduce our dependence on private cars? Automobiles were the creation of the age of oil, as a timely new exhibition about their history at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum makes clear. As nations across the globe get set for the decade of emissions cuts that is mandatory if we are to avoid the catastrophe of global heating of 2C or more, what should be our attitude to driving?Transport is the fastest-growing contributor to global emissions, accounting for around a third of the total in Europe and the US. One recent study found that between 2010 and 2018, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to rises. In the UK, the government is considering a proposal by its climate advisers to bring forward to 2035 a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.But if the environmental case against the combustion engine is clearcut, arguments about electric vehicles are more complicated. While environmentalists argue for a fundamental shift away from private cars, other sceptics borrow their arguments about the damaging impact of electric vehicle manufacturing and batteries to defend the status quo. These are partly technical questions about the way that emissions are calculated, and how other harms – such as that caused by the mining and disposal of cobalt and lithium used in batteries – are balanced against the danger of continued global heating. But their political importance can hardly be overstated. That is because what is at stake, when we talk about the future of the car, is not only a crucially important industrial sector, particularly in Germany, the US and Japan, but also the way that societies are organised.In the 20th century, the car became part of who we are. While this is perhaps truer in the US than anywhere else, car culture as well as technology has made deep inroads in almost every corner of the world. The economic and social aspects of our relationship with motor transport are so bound up together that they are difficult to unwind. But the V\u0026ampA exhibition, drawing on work by cultural historians, illustrates the extent to which cars have shaped the world we know. Exhibits include a useful introduction to the mode of industrial production known as Fordism (after Henry Ford), a depiction of the role of motorways in 20th-century nation-building, and sections on safety, gender, and the future – as well as a vast screen showing video of an oilfield.The alternativesThere is no getting away from the politics of transport. Arguments over the ision of space and resources between roads and public transportation, and between drivers and other travellers – walkers, cyclists, bus passengers – are generally played out as culture wars between rival tribes.Different political philosophies, as well as lifestyles and needs, push people in opposite directions. Broadly speaking, cars appeal most strongly to people (and political parties) who are more invested in private ownership and inidual freedom, while public and low-carbon transport are championed by those who value public space and collective modes of living. All of these issues are even more fraught in the developing world, where investment in public transport is urgently needed if there are to be viable alternatives to further increases in car ownership rates.At a time of dangerous political polarisation, it is important to recognise that beliefs about cars, as about most things, are contingent on experience. Bear in mind the faultlines between cities and towns that have recently attracted notice in countries including France, the US and UK. Attitudes to transport, as to much else, will vary according to geography. A rise in fuel duty was the initial grievance of the gilets jaunes.Climate science dictates that the use of petrol and diesel cars and trucks must be drastically reduced. Electric vehicles are part of the solution, but car culture as a whole also needs an overhaul. This will not be easy. As well as their utility, motor vehicles have come to symbolise powerful human longings for privacy, autonomy, speed, mobility and freedom. Lewis Hamilton is not alone. The rest of us need to do some thinking too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04b6c76e5b12ec2ce04447fcfdee37e54e8c5b56/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5861051516cae33e27ee4f2382cefb7f","title":"brexit britain reputation government civil service","story":"The civil service, parliament, judiciary and the union itself were once admired around the world. Since 2016, that has changedThe world has traditionally looked enviously at the solidity of UK institutions: a politically impartial civil service, an effective parliament, an independent judiciary, a pragmatic constitutional settlement and ultimately the United Kingdom itself. But for how much longer? The Brexit vote and the years of uncertainty that have followed have gnawed at the foundations of each of these.The first pillar to suffer was the civil service. It has always prided itself on its ability to serve governments of any persuasion – in contrast to many other countries. Whereas the US has a top layer of political appointees, German state secretaries are installed on the basis of political sympathies and Australian and Canadian ministers are cocooned by political advisers, the UK has people whose careers flourish under all shades of minister.Initially, at least, Brexit was a boon: it led to a significant increase in staff, and more opportunities for promotion. The service got loads done. It made sure that the statute book was more or less ready for a no-deal exit new systems and processes were developed and are being delivered, and a massive withdrawal agreement was negotiated and then renegotiated.But Brexit also exposed its limitations and undermined trust. It became clear that the civil service lacked a deep understanding of the extent to which the UK was intertwined with the EU and how this interacted with devolution and the delicate balance in Northern Ireland. It also found itself under an unforgiving political spotlight.Its reputation for impartiality had already been compromised by George Osborne’s handling of the Treasury’s post-Brexit forecast, which suggested a severe economic shock the day after the referendum, and led him to threaten an apocalyptic emergency budget. Government analysts have yet to recover from the credibility this lost them in the eyes of Brexit supporters.The May government closed its ears to anyone with EU expertise or experience who warned that the EU would not rush to do a special deal for the UK. As they were ignored internally, there was a Twitter chorus of criticism from ex-officials that seemed to confirm a collective hostility.But the bigger problem was the inability of the May government, so riven by internal isions, to act decisively. The civil service abhors a vacuum, and the absence of effective leadership pushed people such as the UK’s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, into the firing line – and he, rather than the prime minister, was seen as the architect of her reviled deal. In that respect, at least, a more decisive Johnson government is likely to be much easier to work with.But passing the withdrawal agreement won’t mean the pressure is off. Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has long had the civil service in his sights. If his reform agenda is about competence, capacity and accountability that could be good news. If it means civil servants are cowed into not challenging ministers on the implications of their plans, it will be bad. The risk is that we end up with Americanisation – with a politically appointed top layer deterring good professionals from staying. Worse still would be the Trumpification of the civil service – with key posts unfilled or filled by people who are wholly unqualified.The second pillar to be chipped away at has been the reputation of government itself – which means ministers – for basic competence. The UK was always an effective negotiator in Brussels – that was why we secured so many special deals. But since 2016 it has been unclear on both strategy and tactics. Collective cabinet responsibility went into meltdown. The May ministry displayed a talent for diplomatic ineptitude, misreading most of our European allies and assuming that its domestic political messages would not be read abroad, creating an impression of tin-earedness at best and unreliability or untrustworthiness at worst.This has been accompanied by a rocky few years for parliament. The restoration of business as usual, with a hefty majority, will put an end to the war of attrition between the legislature and executive. But the arguments over Brexit have shown parliament’s processes to be in need of a radical overhaul, to avoid the need to resort to little-known procedures at the whim of the Speaker in order to extract information from government. Johnson’s decision to remove MPs’ oversight of negotiations on the future relationship with the EU looks like a declaration of intent that he proposes to cut parliament back down to size.The courts haven’t escaped the general turbulence either. Ministers have bridled at the willingness of judges to intervene on political issues. Theresa May fought to the supreme court to prevent parliament having a say over article 50, and Boris Johnson fumed when his prorogation was coolly voided by Lady Hale and her colleagues. The judiciary came under sustained attack from the press for their allegedly partisan stance and Jacob Rees-Mogg was reported as saying the supreme court had affected a “constitutional coup”.As damaging as the sniping at judges was, the suggestion that the prime minister might play fast and loose with the rule of law, as “anonymous” No 10 sources briefed that he would not seek the extension to EU membership as required, was truly shocking.The roots of all this turmoil lie in the casual approach to constitutional matters that allowed David Cameron to legislate for a referendum as a stratagem to solve a problem within his own party. His memoir suggests that he toyed with the possibility of setting a minimum threshold leave would have to reach in order to win – if he had gone ahead with this, remain would have carried the day. Unlike other countries that use referendums more often and more wisely, the UK has an ad hoc approach to them that has meant since 2016 we have been grappling with how to reconcile representative with direct democracy, an issue finally resolved – though obviously not to everyone’s satisfaction – by the 2019 election.But Brexit and the election have brought into focus the fragility of the final pillar on which our reputation for stable government rests, the union itself. They have given the SNP a pretext to reopen the independence question, apparently settled in 2014, and have tilted opinion in Northern Ireland, making the prospect of a border poll more likely. Both nations voted to remain in 2016, but the UK system – unlike in formal federations – did not assign that any constitutional significance.Earlier this year, the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, a traditional UK ally, told the BBC’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a different country. It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable.” Johnson’s new year resolution, as he looks forward to perhaps a decade in power, should be to make sure Rutte is not proved right.• Jill Rutter is a senior research fellow at UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb4ba9da093cd05436c491fcec8d4001242e853/0_247_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1e042f1e302cb5d9c7d3fc57721e9e","title":"what happened when six travellers were told they were not allowed to post to instagram","story":"If you don’t take a selfie on holiday, did you really go on the holiday?In the years since selfie sticks went global, it has become clear that the mobile phone has changed the way we travel. The ubiquity of social media means tourists can now produce content on the move for their networked audiences to view in close to real time.Where once we shared slideshows post trip and saved prints and postcards as keepsakes, we now share holiday images and selfies from the road, sea or air – expanding the “tourist gaze” from the traveller to include remote audiences back home.Travelling has gone from a solitary quest to a “social occasion”. As such, gazing is becoming inseparably linked with photography. Taking photos has become habitual, rendering the camera as a way of seeing and experiencing new places.Travellers take selfies that present both locations and people in aesthetically pleasing and positive ways.This transforms the relationship between travellers and their social networks in three important ways: between tourists and destination hosts between fellow tourists and lastly, between tourists and those that stay home.The urge to share travel imagery is not without risk. An Australian couple were released from detention in Iran in October, following their arrest for ostensibly flying a drone without a permit.Other tourists earned derision for scrambling to post selfies at Uluru before it was closed to climbers.Meanwhile, there is a sad story behind the newly popular travelgram destination Rainbow Mountain in the Peruvian Andes. It has reportedly only recently emerged due to climate change melting its once snowy peaks.To understand the way social media photography impacts travelling, we undertook an exploratory study of overnight visitors at zoological accommodation in lavish surrounds.We ided 12 participants into two groups. One group was directed to abstain from posting on social media but were still able to take photos. The second group had no restrictions on sharing photos. Though the numbers were small, we gathered qualitative information about engagement and attitudes.Participants were invited to book at Jamala Wildlife Lodge in Canberra. The visit was funded by the researchers – Jamala Wildlife Lodge did not sponsor the research and the interviewees’ stay at the Lodge was a standard visit. We then conducted interviews immediately after their departure from the zoo, critically exploring the full experience of their stay.The study confirmed that the desire to share travel pictures in close to real time is strongly scripted into the role of the tourist altering the way travellers engage with sites they are visiting, but also their sense of urgency to communicate this with remote audiences.Participants Mandy and Amy were among those instructed to refrain from posting pictures to social media while at the zoo. They described having to refrain from social media use as a disappointment, even though it seemed to further their engagement.Interviewer: Did you look at your social media throughout your stay or did you refrain?Mandy: A bit yeah. But even then, probably not reading it as much as I often would. I don’t think I commented on anything yeah.The desire for social media recognition resumed after leaving the zoo. For Michelle, posting after the experience presented new concerns:Interviewer: How did you feel about not being able to post?Michelle: Spanner in the works! For me personally not being able to post was a negative experience because I wanted to show people what we’re doing, when we’re doing it.And I also feel, like a couple of people knew we were going to the zoo, right, and knew that we couldn’t use social media. So, when I eventually post it, they’re going to go, ‘She’s been hanging on to those and now she’s posting them and that’s just a bit weird.’ Like, to post it after the event. Everyone normally posts it in real time.Later, Michelle commented that withholding content from posting to social media also diminished a part of the experience itself:I sort of feel like if we don’t share the photos it’s like a tree fell down in the forest and no one heard it, like, we’ve had this amazing experience and if I don’t share them, then no one’s going to know that we had this experience, you know, apart from us.Digital photography and social media transform the relationship between the travelling self and its audience, as iniduals have an expanded — and potentially ersified — audience.Selfies in tourist contexts reflect the tourist gaze back at the tourist, rather than outward.The perfect digital postcard now incorporates the self centre stage. As one participant suggested:Shannon: It almost feels like it’s kind of an expected behaviour when you are doing something touristy … We’ve actually had tour guides before … kind of a bit disappointed if you don’t take a photograph.The purpose of photography has shifted from a memory aid to a way of sharing experience in the moment. There is tension now between the need to capture tourist experiences for digital sharing and inidual engagement in the tourist activity. Decrying the desire to use photography as a way of communicating experience will not constructively address this tension.To ensure tourism sustainability, and engagement with their target market, tourism providers need to explore better ways to manage travellers’ face-to-face and digital engagement.Digital engagements have become a defining part of travel, and organisations should be encouraged to promote online sharing of experiences — phone charging stations and photo competitions were two suggestions offered by our interviewees.In contrast, device-free days or activities could be another way to encourage face-to-face engagement and prompt tourists to be more considered with their online sharing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93dc9ffc29b3d653d0c5cfb5e83ca3d525e3e1d2/350_145_3775_2266/master/3775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d283e9ff3fd05dc208e3dd61403cb6","title":"tell us about your run down school buildings","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about school buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.

This is a technically advanced indoor vertical farm buried deep in a basement at a former Tate \u0026amp Lyle warehouse and now the Liverpool Life Sciences UTC.Two academics pooled their resources, recruited PhD and master’s students and are growing food hydroponically in towers – an increasingly popular concept where salads and leafy greens are grown all year round under precise conditions in vertically stacked foam-filled beds without natural sunlight and soil.The farm is the creation of Jens Thomas and Paul Myers, both with scientific backgrounds, who first met at a conference and then again at a Thai boxing class before deciding to work together. They founded Farm Urban in 2014.Since then, they have installed systems across the city including at the University of Liverpool, Alder Hey children’s hospital and Ness Botanic Gardens and have carried out a range of public outreach activities.To preserve natural habitats and improve worldwide food security there needs to be a complete overhaul of food production methods, say Thomas and Myers.They are in precarious territory. Similar schemes have failed, including one in Greater Manchester. The Biospheric Foundation, based in a mill by the banks of the River Irwell in Salford, was supposed to be a state-of-the-art urban aquaponic farm, where fish waste provided the food source for growing plants, and the plants provided a natural filter for the water. Three years after the project opened, it went under more than £100,000 in debt, with the reputation of the whole scheme in tatters.Such food production schemes face very real financial challenges. First, there are the costs that, if not carefully managed, could end up being astronomical. They are mainly associated with the energy use required to maintain a controlled environment and provide artificial light. There is the issue of the carbon footprint of using high amounts of energy amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There has also been criticism of the farms for being geared to producing only leafy greens and not higher-calorie crops.Thomas and Myers insist their project is different. Their aims are hyperlocal – they want to start small and gear production in tandem with increasing commercial interest in their products. Their current vertical farm, which was shipped over from Canada, has been paid for by First Ark, a Knowsley-based social investment organisation. The £150,000 funding is part-loan and part-grant.Thomas and Myers are hoping to recoup some of the cash by selling salad boxes for £12.50 to iniduals and businesses, with annual subscriptions costing £600. They have also launched a crowdfunding campaign, Greens for Good, where every box of greens bought by a local business supports a box of greens going to a local school. They have raised more than £17,000 of their £25,000 goal.Myers, 32, the son of a hairdresser and entrepreneur, became interested in food production while working on his PhD at the National Cancer Institute. Billions are spent on drugs research, but he feels there needs to be a more holistic approach to look at how diet and food quality can affect health.“This is the farming of the future. Pesticide-free and moving from the traditional horse and tractor agriculture that is steadily destroying the planet to a more sustainable approach,” he says.Myers is fully aware of the risks of his chosen career path. “Yes, I am a bit scared – we have taken on a huge debt – but we de-risked it as much as humanly possible and now it’s just a case of carrying on and working to make it work.”He certainly has the backing of students Emmanuella Aul-Mku and Rhianna Ghalleb, both 14, who have seen firsthand the benefits of growing salad in vertical farms. Their school canteen upstairs serves salad from the farm and pupils are regularly invited into the basement to see the mechanics of the technologically advanced food production.Ghalleb, who spent some of her childhood in Tunisia, and Aul-Mku in Nigeria, both come from families which grew their own vegetables and fruit in their back gardens.“My nanna had olive trees and figs and I would do gardening with her all the time and help her grow things but we don’t do that here. We just go to Asda and buy our food in plastic packets – we don’t know what conditions it has been grown in – what has been used to help it grow,” says Ghalleb.Aul-Mku agrees this reliance on supermarkets affects people’s relationship with food and thinks these new vertical farms could change that.“We get to see it growing in front of us and that really makes a difference. If there were farms like this everywhere then people would be able to feel part of a community because they would all be growing food for each other,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a8408b98330e419332f13f950b9bfa247038c8/0_0_2550_3300/master/2550.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be854115d60a75f83deba9e766bd1625 1400w","title":"frank lampard chelsea southampton","story":"Not for the first time Lampard lamented how his players had lacked personality in possession as they slipped to a third defeat in their past four home Premier League matches. If the team’s inconsistency persists, they will lose their grip on a top-four place.Chelsea are free to trade next month after the club’s transfer ban was lifted and Lampard was asked whether this performance had given him a nudge in terms of recruitment. “I learn about the players and I learn about the players particularly in games like that,” he said tersely.Lampard’s team previously lost 1-0 at home against Bournemouth and, a couple of weeks before that, 1-0 at home against West Ham. “It’s the same story,” Lampard said. “I’ll probably give you the exact same press conference as I gave after Bournemouth.“If you’re an offensive player, play round the corner, join, mix up your game and break defensive lines because teams aren’t stupid – you need to do more in an attacking sense. Personality comes in – in lots of different ways. Today it was in a football sense: of finding and taking the ball into tight spaces and delivering something. We didn’t do it.“If you are on the run we are on at home, there is more pressure because everyone talks about it. We feel it. People are coming here and respecting us as Chelsea because they are setting up in that way but we are not playing like the Chelsea that can break that down. It is a clear statement that you need a form of consistency to come in the top four. If we want to stay there, we have to move onwards and upwards. We need to win more than we have won recently at home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/903016fa6c8badd58150e0430f8b231644d870d2/0_118_3792_2276/master/3792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81391d5763f1cf9d506573230786e50","title":"leicester city liverpool premier league match report","story":"Sweeping from the Middle East to the Midlands without breaking stride, Liverpool took a big step closer to adding that much craved Premier League trophy to their recently acquired world crown. As in Qatar, so in Leicester, as Roberto Firmino opened the scoring here. But Liverpool did not settle for merely beating their nearest domestic rivals. They crushed Leicester as if issuing a warning to anyone who dares to challenge their supremacy.James Milner scored from the spot before Firmino got another and Trent Alexander-Arnold lashed in a long-range shot to claim a superb goal to go with two elegant assists. This, then, was an almost feudal display, imperious rulers against bereft subjects. No one else has made Leicester look so puny this season.Granted, Brendan Rodgers’ team had lost a little momentum going into this game, collecting only one point from their previous two matches. But they are still a formidable side, a fact that Jürgen Klopp recognised by deploying his strongest available team. Rodgers, meanwhile, made one alteration to the lineup that started Leicester’s defeat by Manchester City, with Dennis Praet replacing Ayoze Pérez. That entailed a change of formation, with Harvey Barnes on the right while James Maddison operated from the left, and replicated the lineup Rodgers used at Anfield in October, when Leicester felt aggrieved to lose to a last-minute penalty by Milner. The plot failed and this time Leicester could have no quibble with the result. They were outclassed from start to finish.It took two minutes for Alexander-Arnold to demonstrate his menace, as he sauntered into open space wide on the right and unleashed a swerving shot that Kasper Schmeichel had to bat away. Liverpool, showing no ill-effects from their travels, put their hosts under severe pressure, making Leicester look sluggish. Jonny Evans should have been punished in the sixth minute when Georginio Wijnaldum pounced on a casual pass-out from the back, but Mohamed Salah lifted a shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Salah went on to have an unusually ineffective game but key Leicester players were even less effective, with Maddison practically irrelevant in his outpost on the left.Just as Leicester were beginning to find their feet, Liverpool nearly tore them apart. Naby Keïta cut through their defence with a pass from deep and Salah ran on to it, dodging a challenge by the outrushing Schmeichel. From an acute angle he tried to reproduce the geometric marvel that he summoned in the Champions League joust with Red Bull Salzburg earlier this month. But this time, even though he was able to use his preferred left foot,he could only dab the ball into the side netting.Leicester sprung a dangerous-looking counterattack in the 20th minute but it transpired to be nothing more than an opportunity for Joe Gomez to demonstrate impressive speed by keeping up with Vardy before Alisson ran out of the box to quash the threat with that serene manner of his. Then Liverpool asserted their supremacy at the other end. Alexander-Arnold collected the ball in an unfamiliar position on the left but treated it with his customary finesse, dropping a superb cross over Ben Chilwell and into the path of Firmino, who nodded home from close range.Leicester were still reeling from that when they gave up another opportunity. Schmeichel remained vigilant enough to deny Sadio Mané, who should have given him no chance from eight yards. But by now Liverpool were utterly dominant. Leicester made it to half-time thankful they trailed by only one goal.The half-time team talks did not exactly inspire a transformation but Leicester did, at least, muster their first shot of the game in the 46th minute, Youri Tielemans’ drive from the edge of the box ricocheting off Gomez and out for a corner. However, Liverpool pressed so intelligently and intensely that Leicester struggled to make it out of their own territory.Alexander-Arnold cantered forward to deliver another fine cross in the 52nd minute, but Ricardo Pereira made sure Andrew Robertson did not get on the end of it. Moments later Robertson dispossessed a defender near the Leicester corner flag and crossed for Firmino, who missed from six yards.Praet flashed a shot from distance just wide as Leicester tried to retaliate but, as they attacked more, Caglar Soyuncu twice had to stop Salah from profiting from counter-attacks. The Turk was entitled to feel satisfied when Salah was substituted. But seconds later Soyuncu inadvertently handled the ball from a corner by Alexander-Arnold. Milner hit the penalty down the middle. It was his first touch.Soon Firmino highlighted the chasm between the teams by making it 3-0 from a cross by Alexander-Arnold. And then the young full-back emphasised the point by ramming a superb low shot into the corner of the net from over 20 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490db7746e0ce199a392bc3cebef35cbed56b578/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ed322748ffaf05a5078f86423dcccd4","title":"manchester united newcastle premier league match report","story":"Manchester United again illustrated their ambiguous character by rebounding from Sunday’s dismal defeat at Watford with this smooth-geared, canter of a victory.They even gave Newcastle the advantage of a goal start during a dire few first‑half minutes before upping quality and control to pull away and display a ruthlessness they can sometimes lack.It meant only a second league win when enjoying more possession than opponents in the 18 matches since Ole Gunnar Solskjær was made permanent manager in March.Solskjær entered the match talking of how the defeat at Watford was down to his team’s callowness. That was not in evidence this time, though after a Marcus Rashford free-kick that was deflected led to three successive corners, then came United’s blip.The last of the three was won back by Newcastle and suddenly Dwight Gayle and Jetro Willems were involved in a breakaway that Aaron Wan-Bissaka was relieved to halt just outside his area.There was similar emotion when Mason Greenwood lost the ball inside the Newcastle half and again they charged through. This move ended with Joelinton feeding Gayle and he should have scored from close range.There was no escape the third time as Matty Longstaff repeated his feat of two months ago, when scoring in the reverse fixture. Yet again the home side were slipshod: Fred was dispossessed and black‑and‑white shirts flooded forward. Gayle fed Longstaff and he chipped sweetly into Joelinton who returned the ball – under extreme pressure – for his teammate to slide home.United woke up quickly as they had to, though Newcastle’s Martin Dubravka will not wish to see replays of how Anthony Martial’s equaliser squeezed in at his near post. This came after Rashford and Luke Shaw combined along the left before the latter found Andreas Pereira. His layoff was smart and allowed Martial to shoot.Solskjær has spoken recently of the difficulty of leaving out Mason Greenwood and the young forward was about to remind us why. When Fabian Schär passed loosely the 18-year-old pounced on the ball, advanced, then fired a shot that deflected off Federico Fernández and went in off the bar.United threatened further with a Pereira shot and a Greenwood cross before striking again. This time Wan-Bissaka stood the ball up and Rashford hung high, outmuscling Schär to power in a magnificent header. VAR checked for a McTominay hand on Matty Longstaff but the goal – correctly – stood.For the second half Paul Pogba – who asked his teammates to wear “We are one”’ and “No to racism” wrist bands during (and solely for) the warm-up – was sent on in place of McTominay. His opening action was a crafty dummy that allowed the ball to roll to Martial in the area. Next, a 20-yard shot that just missed the outside of Dubravka’s right post solidified the sense Pogba could help wrap up the result quickly, and moments later United had a fourth goal for only the second time in the league this term.Again this was self-inflicted by Newcastle: Sean Longstaff swivelled near halfway and hit the ball back but only into Martial’s path. He sprinted in and despite a heavy touch still dinked the ball over the advancing Dubravka. United were now rampant. Pogba’s balletic feet created space but his left-foot shot was too close to the Newcastle goalkeeper. Next, he threaded the ball to Martial and his effort hit the left-hand post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6315501ce4a437b2a66d83f7b666dd622c358ff/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea8a9159db42aefc2927df28d96ef72b","title":"i lied to my family and spent christmas day alone","story":"I had a steak – with chips, no sprouts – and a nice bottle of rioja. I went for a walk. There were no arguments about what to watch on TV. Best Christmas everI haven’t always hated Christmas I think I enjoyed it as a kid. Not so much since. It is a little about the food (if turkey and sprouts are such good news, why don’t we eat them on any other day, eh?). It has a little more to do with rampant consumerism. Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath … funny how a festival that is supposed to be about the birth of Christ has come to encompass so many Christian sins. But this isn’t about him it’s about me, my own family and my own insecurities.I think things turned sour in my 30s, when my siblings selfishly started having families of their own. Suddenly there were new people and generations involved it became more complicated logistically, as what had been a simple family gathering exploded. This lot went here, that lot there … oh, God, what about Sam? Where’s he going to go? Whose turn is it? I wasn’t involved in these conversations, but I’m sure they happened. They did in my mind, anyway. I had become the grumpy grandad no one wanted, before even being a dad.I could – and should – have just spent Christmas alone, for everyone’s sake. But that would have made them feel bad, and I didn’t want that or to be felt sorry for. So I went along, to wherever there was room or I was least unwelcome, to whoever’s turn it was. I ate my sprouts – mmm – and I tried to be the fun uncle, and not to disapprove so obviously of the mountains of presents being ripped open (while also, hypocritically, feeling sorry for myself as I strung out the unwrapping of my own pitiful molehill of hastily thrown-together afterthoughts). I don’t think I fooled anyone.And then one year I did fool them – everyone. Uncharacteristically, and improbably, I found myself in the situation known as having a girlfriend (I had had them before, just not for Christmas). She came with a family of her own, and they asked me if I would like to spend Christmas with them. No, of course I bloody wouldn’t, but it gave me an idea. That’s very kind, I said, but I’m spending it with my family. They’d be devastated if I wasn’t there. (Ha!)See where this is going? I then told my family that I would be spending Christmas with my girlfriend’s family – I was keen to get to know them better. And my family concealed any relief they may have been feeling. At least they didn’t need to feel sorry for me because I wouldn’t be alone at home …Which is exactly what and where I was, of course. By myself, as myself. I had a steak – with chips, no sprouts – and a nice bottle of rioja. (I don’t really remember that it was rioja, but in my mind it was a grade or two above the usual. It could have even broken the £10 barrier.) I toasted absent friends and family. Yeah, maybe there was a bit of gluttony involved, but it’s hard to remain sin-free at Christmas. I went for a walk London is beautiful on Christmas Day. There were no arguments about what to watch I caught up on some of the films I had missed in the year just gone. I may have felt a little sorry for myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing so. It was perfect – best Christmas ever. But impossible to repeat.It turns out the girlfriend wasn’t just for Christmas, but for life (so far). We did some new-generation-creating of our own, and since then, as you can imagine, it has been impossible to sneak off. But that’s OK.I still hate Christmas because of the turkey, sprouts and all of that sinning. Also wrapping – I really don’t like wrapping. But now I don’t have to pretend not to hate it: I’m the Grinch, but out and proud. Which is liberating, even amusing – for me. And I’ll always have the memories of the year I went free solo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab53fd48c31a5028e17f998e9eea62a9d2589105/0_563_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9bed23277ae310f298d3da7e3b8e43e","title":"jack monroe motherhood thank you brave father","story":"In this series writers celebrate a person who changed their lives.

So I’ll start from the beginning.I still remember the first day we met, at the Basildon coffee shop we worked in. I was new and you were laughing as you showed me the ropes: how to froth the milk differently for a cappuccino and a latte how to pour the coffee so the crema on the top was just right. You were patient with my clumsiness, and everybody respected you, and more importantly, enjoyed your company. Little did we know, then, how it would all turn out. “I think that cream is off”, you furrowed your brow, holding out a frappuccino for me to test. As I leaned in to sniff it, you dunked my head in. I flicked it at your face, and mayhem ensued.A few years, and many more practical jokes later, I nervously told you I was pregnant. You didn’t hesitate. “Anything you decide to do, anything you need, I’ll support you,” you said. I was so frightened, and you were so strong and steadfast. It’s been that way ever since. Our patchwork family – mother, father, our partners, your additional children, your parents, my parents, our partners’ parents, sisters, cousins, and everyone in between, have all helped to raise this small boy between us.We don’t fight. I don’t recall a single argument we co-operate without drama or disarray. I’ve done some stupid things in the past 10 years and you have quietly picked up the pieces each time. At every new school, after every failed relationship, you have been there with your silent reassurance. I’ve been a mess, but I’m doing OK now, and one of the threads holding this whole damn scruffy tapestry together is you.I know this may slightly embarrass you, because you are modest and humble, but I want to thank you for the last decade, as we look to the next one and whatever it holds and for the greatest gift of all – our son – who grows more like his father every day, with his big blue eyes, his ability to hold a room and make everyone feel special his generous heart. I know we don’t really do feelings, but I bloody love you, and I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I am still frightened of motherhood, but knowing that my co-pilot on this journey is you is very reassuring. You’re the best, bravest and most decent man I’ve ever met, and I consider myself lucky every single day to be raising a son with you.Merry Christmas and, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c668761df427984507ce1b8ffcf0500177be62/0_286_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b770c9b7dc7c2841d7a7e4b54a519e67","title":"2010 2019 a decade in pictures","story":"’s picture editors take a look back at some of the news photography that has defined the past 10 yearsFrom the earthquake in Haiti at the start of 2010, the decade was defined by successive international refugee crises, natural disasters and conflict.

WarnerMedia chiefs decided against pulling content in order to plough it into the streaming service HBO Max, which will now not launch in the UK as a result, instead sticking with Sky for at least the next five years.“Sky would certainly have had to pay up to keep the premium content offered through the HBO deal, but it is now a bit less vulnerable going into negotiations with Disney,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst at investment bank Berenberg. “But given the ambition of Disney+ it will be very hard to renew that deal. There is an ongoing erosion of the pay-TV proposition and if Disney and Fox go it would certainly be significant, although I wouldn’t quite say it would be a hammer blow for Sky.”Sky is an immensely profitable partner for Disney and it is expected that even if the US entertainment group does pull its prime movies and TV shows, it will continue to have a deal in place for its TV channels – such as Disney Junior and Disney XD – to continue to be broadcast to Sky’s 24 million pay-TV customers across Europe. “Our customers love Disney content and we have a long standing relationship with Disney that we expect to continue,” said a spokesman for Sky.With a £7bn annual war chest to strike deals to keep prime content on pay-TV, Sky is expected to pull out all the stops to try to keep Disney on-board in some way. “Sky can’t afford to lose so much content and they will be trying to retain access somehow given Disney also needs its crown jewels to make Disney+ work,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere.

In 2013, Winter, now 22, was an anxious, antisocial 10th-grader (year 11 in the UK) at a competitive high school in Houston. Playing guitar provided a respite from his intense workload. He had been copying Elliott Smith and Nick Drake songs, though he found it unsatisfying to play music that was written to be heard as part of a group. But through seeing Gunn’s NPR Tiny Desk Concert, he became instantly possessed by the rustic, instrumental guitar music known as American primitive.One name haunted his new obsession – the Chicago guitarist Jack Rose, whose work acquired a mythic allure after his untimely death in 2009. On 1 January 2014, Winter made a ceremonial date to listen to his much-lauded album Kensington Blues. “Either it’ll click completely, or it won’t feel right and amen,” he recalls thinking, speaking the day before he flies home from Chicago for Christmas. “But, of course, it blew me away.”It was the first time he had heard the guitar “carrying the weight of a piece all by itself”, he says. “I started to realise the extent to which not only was that possible, but it was also meaningful.” Now a creative writing student at the University of Chicago, Winter has made his contribution to that lineage with his startlingly accomplished debut, The Time to Come. He is an elegant and emotive player: Woodlawn Waltz is rambling and chipper Knock It Out is brisk with virtuoso electric guitar moments that show off Winter’s knack for changing the mood with subtle variations in intensity. Released on his friend’s label Blue Hole Records, it’s as enveloping as anything on scene mainstays Paradise of Bachelors and Tompkins Square.Winter is self-taught – the only way to build a distinctive foundation as a player, he says – and eschews the blues influence that underpins much music in this world (American primitive forefather John Fahey “never clicked” for him). “When I hear somebody playing an original composition that relies on whatever blues progression, the first thing I want to do is scream because it’s been done so much.” His first creative impulse is towards prettiness, he explains, with a hat-tip to British folkies such as Michael Chapman. These weren’t names being dropped at his Houston high school, where rap ruled. When it came to choosing colleges, Chicago appealed for its food and major-league baseball, but primarily its music. “I had the sense that there was this cross-pollination of musicians playing across musical approaches that wouldn’t quite happen elsewhere,” says Winter, citing the experimental labels Thrill Jockey, Drag City and Touch and Go.The Time to Come is tethered between his two homes. The standout, 15-minute title track is rooted in the death of a Houston friend who also attended the University of Chicago. Although she had been sick, “her death took us all quite by surprise,” says Winter. A song by Virginia guitarist and mentor Daniel Bachman, Won’t You Cross Over to That Other Shore, helped him work out how to “grieve meaningfully” in his own music: a spacious, surprisingly bright song that is seemingly always reaching towards something. “I don’t like to play in minor keys,” he says. “It feels like a one-note emotional response. Major keys, as feelings go, I find that I’m able to evoke more in myself. That song is the closest thing I have to bringing her back.”He didn’t come away with any profound lessons about grief. “I’m generally reassured by the thought of allowing things to be unexplained or chaotic, to resist the narrative impulse,” he says. But when Hurricane Harvey struck his hometown (albeit not his parents’ house) the resonance was unavoidable: here was a tangible form of loss, one that grounded the album. “How can you make sense not just of loss, but loss when you haven’t really been part of it, you’ve only been a bystander, and there’s only so much you can do to mitigate or rectify its after-effects in others?” Winter says. “How do you manage?”After Winter graduates this summer, he will throw himself into music, touring as much as possible, without burning out. Performing, he says, has changed his life. “I’ve grown a lot because of it. Often, when I’m playing a show, I can more readily reach for some better version of myself onstage than off, somehow.” He’s already recorded his next album – three songs, including a 23-minute epic and a band piece – and has been talking to small labels. “I also, of course, am totally interested in swinging for the fences,” he says, recalling schoolboy fantasies of signing to Merge or Matador. “I’ve always done that, so I feel like I might as well continue to shoot for the moon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

She was helped by members of the public, who called an ambulance, according to reports.A witness told Cambridge News she had seen the new mother and her two children wrapped up in blankets inside ambulances when she cycled past at about 7.15am on Monday.“They were all in the ambulances by the time I cycled past,” she said. “My workmate was first on the scene, and luckily Sainsbury’s was open early that morning and she ran in there for help.The numbers of people sleeping rough across Scotland have also risen, with 2,682 people reported as having slept rough on at least one occasion.Shelter, whose figures include rough sleepers and people in temporary accommodation, estimate that overall around 320,000 people are homeless in Britain.The government’s Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which places new duties on state institutions to intervene earlier to prevent homelessness has been in force for more than a year, but two thirds of councils have warned they cannot afford to comply with it. In 2018, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, announced a one-off £30m funding pot for immediate support for councils to tackle rough sleeping.Rough sleeping and begging are illegal in ENgland and Wales under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which makes ‘wandering abroad and lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building, or in the open air, or under a tent, or in any cart or wagon, and not giving a good account of himself or herself’ liable to a £1,000 fine. Leading homelessness charities, police and politicians have called on the government to scrap the law.Since 2014, councils have increasingly used public space protection orders to issue £100 fines. The number of homeless camps forcibly removed by councils across the UK has more than trebled in five years, figures show, prompting campaigners to warn that the rough sleeping crisis is out of control and has become an entrenched part of life in the country.A Labour party analysis has claimed that local government funding cuts are disproportionately hitting areas that have the highest numbers of deaths among homeless people. Nine of the 10 councils with the highest numbers of homeless deaths in England and Wales between 2013 and 2017 have had cuts of more than three times the national average of £254 for every household.A study of more than 900 homeless patients at a specialist healthcare centre in the West Midlands found that they were 60 times more likely to visit A\u0026ampE in a year than the general population in England.Sarah Marsh, Rajeev Syal and Patrick GreenfieldEast of England ambulance service told Cambridge News that paramedics went to the scene just before 7am on Monday. The woman and her children were taken to Rosie hospital, a specialist maternity hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge.Research by the  last year identified Trinity as the wealthiest of all the colleges in both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, with published assets at the time of £1.3bn.A crowdfunding campaign set up to raise money for the woman decried Cambridge as a place of “extraordinary inequality”. Jess Agar, who started the fundraiser, wrote: “Imagine giving birth alone on the pavement, in the shadow of the richest college in Cambridge.“Whether we are religious or not, many of us will be familiar with the Christmas story of a mother who gave birth to her child in poverty, seeking refuge in a stable. This is the reality for many people living on the streets.”Contributors have so far donated more than £9,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3a64a9cfa37bfb3a0163ac72c7bfd0887f5a610/0_83_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d306979049e7a8b2b0d65c0763aa57f","title":"australia v new zealand boxing day test day two live","story":"If Australia shaded Boxing Day they stamped their authority all over this Test match on day two against New Zealand, batting the tourists into distraction for most of the day and then firing out two top-order stars before the close. The Kiwis are already facing an uphill task to avoid consecutive humiliating defeats.Steve Smith laid the platform, patiently accumulating 85 before Travis Head (114) took on the job of shepherd, inching to his second Test century and securing his short-term future in the process. He put on a momentum-changing 150 with Tim Paine whose dashing 79 was his highest Test score as captain. A late slog for quick runs ended with Australia all out for 467, a first innings total well above par considering the amount of movement on offer with the new ball.That total was soon made to look gargantuan when Pat Cummins dismantled makeshift opener Tom Blundell’s technique (15) and Kane Williamson (9) miscued a pull off James Pattinson to leave his side miles behind. With three scorching hot days to come New Zealand face the prospect of long drawn out torture simply to remain alive in the series. To find out if they can survive tomorrow’s examination join Adam Collins and I right here.18th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Latham 9, Taylor 2) Lyon gets another opportunity and he finds a tempting line and length outside off stump that has Taylor watchfully smothering anything coming his way. 17th over: New Zealand 43-2 (Latham 9, Taylor 1) Pattinson continues to hurl himself into his work but Latham is up to the task, defending anything straight, leaving anything wide, and working a couple off his pads for good measure. 16th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Latham 7, Taylor 1) Nathan Lyon with an early look at the pitch and he begins by inducing a thick edge from Latham’s lope forward. Not much else worth reporting as New Zealand put their shots away with the close of play under ten minutes away.Cummins’ superb opening spell was seven overs, one for eight, by the way. 15th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 1) Oh boy, if Cummins to Latham is a match-up Australia like then they love Pattinson to Taylor. The first ball of the over is clipped in the air to short leg but it’s too hot to hold for the man under the lid. The second rips through Taylor’s forward press, smacks into the pad and umpire Erasmus raises his finger! TAYLOR REVIEWS, AND DRS INDICATES THE BALL WAS BOUNCING OVER THE TOP. That was full enough to give with the naked eye but Taylor survives. 14th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 1) Latham is not happy at all repeatedly facing Cummins. His latest interrogation features a short ball that leaves a cherry red mark on his white shirt just below his silver fern. Pinned to his crease Cummins then targets the pads but Latham gets enough bat in the way to prolong his torture.13th over: New Zealand 39-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 0) To use host broadcaster parlance, Pattinson is up and about. When he gets his tail up like this he reminds me of a juvenile Rottweiler, muscular and eager, with that slight hint of undomesticated menace about him. With the added energy boost of his wicket he beats Latham for pace and arrows in a superb yorker that is only just repelled. Full and wide from Pattinson so Williamson reaches and strokes a cover drive that travels about as far as a cricket ball can in a Test arena without touching a rope. The all-run four means Williamson retains the strike and he perishes next ball! Quick and short from Pattinson, tucking Williamson up, but the Kiwi skipper nonetheless tries the pull, but he can only top-edge high in the air for Paine to run around to leg-gully and pouch the catch. Huge dismissal. Australia steamrollering their way through this match now. 12th over: New Zealand 35-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 5) Latham accepts a rare invitation to get forward and pushes a couple through the covers. The movement and timing probably warranted a boundary but Latham’s closed bat face once again proved his undoing. Ricky Ponting then goes on to forensically examine Latham’s flawed technique, concluding that it is not good, especially outside off stump. Cummins illustrates the point by whistling a delivery past the outside edge, getting one to hold its line from around the wicket. 11th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Latham 4, Williamson 5) Pattinson must bowl about the heaviest ball in the game. It really does thud into the bat. New Zealand play him well this over though, trusting the length, and the pitch, which has so far not misbehaved since the innings break. 10th over: New Zealand 31-1 (Latham 3, Williamson 4) The first slightly wayward over from Cummins in his spell but Latham can only fashion two from it, missing out on a leg stump full toss. This is Cummins we’re talking about, so even a below-par set of six contains the odd pearler, including the final delivery that cuts Latham in half and almost grazes the inside-edge of his bat.During the drinks break another AFL footballer is interviewed by the host broadcaster. That particular intervention with Steele Sidebottom was about as vapid as you could design, including an admission from Sidebottom that he’d never watched a Test at the G before, which is about as un-Victorian as it gets. 9th over: New Zealand 29-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 4) Time for James Pattinson, and the parochial Victorian crowd roars its approval. Pattinson is a big strong fella, built like a rugby union centre, or the trunk of a gum tree in the Dandenong Ranges. He starts well, finding a Cummins-like line and length in excess of 140kph. Williamson squirts a single behind point and Latham scampers a leg-bye as New Zealand inch their score along as the final drinks break of the day begins. 8th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Cummins now coming around the wicket to Latham, and he almost gets his man with a beauty that jags in off the seam and almost finds the inside edge. Cummins ends the over with his third maiden, moreover, there’s been just one scoring shot in the 24 deliveries he’s sent down this afternoon so far.7th over: New Zealand 27-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Williamson can’t resist chasing a wide one off Starc and he almost perishes in the gully. Starc then bowls a bouncer so high it’s called a wide then slings down a wicked in-swinging yorker. Line and length then completes the variations from this fast bowling enigma. 6th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 3) Williamson off the mark with a late cut for three down to third-man, but the over belonged to Pat Cummins and yet another demonstration of his class. Simply too good for Tom Blundell. He needed just three sighters before landing the ball on the precise line and length required to snare his man. Wonderful controlled fast bowling. Blundell has started positively but the signs of some technical deficiencies are starting to emerge. He does like to feel bat on ball away from his body... and right on cue... he drives at a tempting length and feathers a regulation behind. Terrific start for Australia and another selection headache at the top of the order for the Kiwis. 5th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 15) There’s that backfoot drive again from Blundell, right up en pointe, guiding Starc through point for three. Australia’s big quick is reaching some tasty speeds but his radar isn’t quite calibrated. 4th over: New Zealand 20-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 12) If Starc to Blundell is unpredictable and full of incident, Cummins to Latham is a study of discipline. The bowler, charging in over the wicket, is aiming to hit the seam and angle the ball away from the batsman just short of a good length. Latham is watchful, hanging back and leaving as often as he can. He is doing so as much on height as line but it almost undoes him late in the over when Cummins produces the one that goes the other way and almost pins his man LBW. 3rd over: New Zealand 20-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 12) Beautiful shot from Blundell, emerging from his crouch like a sunflower addressing the sky , standing tall, and executing a classic backfoot square drive for four. Starc, with his dander up, then hurls down his first bouncer of the day and it flies and flies and flies, over the batsman, over the keeper, one bounce for four byes! Oh dear. On its way to the fence the ball thumped into the robot camera that patrols the boundary and hit it with such force the nearly-new Kookaburra needs replacing. The second ball of the innings is soon back where the first one perished, courtesy of a fine glance for four. All action at the MCG with Starc touching 150kph. 2nd over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 4) Cummins shares the new ball and he almost has Latham first up! Short and on the hip Latham can only glove nervously around the corner and look on in relief as the Kookaburra lands between short-leg and the keeper. The remainder of the over is angled across the batsman, the final delivery beating the outside edge for pace and bounce. “Afternoon Jonathan from a rather grey and very strike-bound Paris. (France, not Texas),” Gervase Greene, always a pleasure to hear from you. “I have been waiting much of the day for Pain(e) to miscue a square cut down to fine-leg off CdG so I could contribute a witty bon mot on this game of French cricket. Like hopeful passengers on the , I’m still waiting.” 1st over: New Zealand 8-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 4) Starc opens with a no-ball that the left-handed Latham works away for a single. The right-handed Blundell then survives a nifty in-swinger before nudging off his pads for his first two runs as a Test opener. A couple more follow soon after for Blundell, who is very still and very crouched at the crease. The over ends with Blundell playing and missing a howitzer that thunders into Paine’s gloves.No bouncer from Starc that over so it’s hard to discern what the pitch is doing. There was a bit of shape in the air but nothing prodigious.There will be 20 more overs before the close of play. The heavy roller rumbles away from centre stage. Mitchell Starc prowls at the top of his mark. Toms Latham and Blundell adjust their grilles. Here we go!The obvious question now is: how will the pitch behave? It’s hard to answer conclusive I’m afraid. The surface is generally on the slowish side but there are the small indentations created yesterday by the new ball on the soft top that allow for occasional uneven bounce. If Australia’s taller, faster, pacemen can hit those pock marks, the wicket could prove a handful. Trent Boult found those spots in his most recent spell and there was enough in his effort balls to suggest the New Zealand openers will not relish the conditions. Australia’s first innings began poorly with the cheap dismissal of Joe Burns but it’s been all uphill since then, ending with a very healthy 467. Travis Head’s second Test century is the standout inidual score but much is owed to Steve Smith for grafting his way through 242 deliveries when New Zealand were at their most threatening. Tim Paine’s rapid 79 gave the innings some impetus late-on, setting up the post-tea thrash.What have New Zealand got in response?That’s your lot. Lyon can’t resist hooking Southee and he helps it all the way to the safe hands of Wagner on the fine-leg boundary. 155th over: Australia 467-9 (Pattinson 14, Lyon 1) Wagner is hunting a five-for but he can’t bag it this over. Pattinson looks to be ending any debate over who bats eight in the future when he lines up alongside both Cummins and Starc. 154th over: Australia 463-9 (Pattinson 11, Lyon 0) Before Cummins’ wicket Pattinson absolutely smoked Southee through midwicket for four. After it Lyon dabbed three defensive prods. Another one goes hitting out, Cummins this time, swiping Southee to midwicket where Latham holds on. 153rd over: Australia 458-8 (Pattinson 6, Cummins 0) Australia continue to bat on despite the wickets falling and Wagner - in the 153rd over of the innings - celebrates a wicket-maiden. Head holes out, miscuing Wagner high to point where Santner takes a simple running catch. Superb innings. Deserves the standing ovation from 50,000+ inside the MCG. 152nd over: Australia 458-7 (Head 114, Pattinson 6) Southee is just cannon fodder now with Australia in T20 mode, but with the field well-placed he concedes just four singles. 151st over: Australia 454-7 (Head 112, Pattinson 4) Edges, run outs, LBW appeals, Mitchell Santner, nothing has gone right for New Zealand this match so far. And Head, of course, rubs salt into the wounds, ramping Wagner for four then belting him for four like a Roger Federer crosscourt backhand. Australia are now out here for a good time, not a long time.Wagner invites Williamson to go upstairs again in search of an LBW and it looks a good call. He beats Head down the leg-side with the batter well across his stumps. Was there an inside-edge? DRS reveals it is as close to out as you can get but the margin for error on height is just - barely - umpire’s call, so Head survives. New Zealand’s poor fortune continues to stalk them. 150th over: Australia 444-7 (Head 104 Pattinson 4) After Head raised his bat, Pattinson leaned into a cover drive sweeter than any we’ve seen all Test. Sumptuous timing for four. Australia hurtling towards a declaration now. By the way, Head is the first South Australian since... Jason Gillespie to score a Test century. The batsmen crossed during Starc’s dismissal, meaning Head is on strike for a possible five deliveries of Southee’s over. He needs only two to bring up his second Test century, driving square on the off-side for four, removing his helmet and smiling in relief after finally converting one of his many starts into an historic contribution. Southee replaces Santner and jags a wicket first ball. Starc tried to send a mid-iron into the Yarra but he chunked it, lobbing a simple catch to mid-on. Both Cummins and Pattinson must be giggling into their Fast Bowling Cartel (TM) apparel. 149th over: Australia 435-6 (Head 99, Starc 1) #Declarationspeculation just got exciting. Intrigue over who would bat eight for Australia was supposed to be about Cummins and Pattinson but out strides Starc, presumably to long-handle a few en route to a declaration sooner rather than later. He does his bit for Head and gets off strike smartish, but the man 99 not out cannot squeeze his way to a ton from three Wagner deliveries despite one of them being a knee-high slow full toss. Wagner comes around the wicket for the second over after tea, and he begins with a full fast delivery that raps Paine on his front pad. An LBW appeal follows, declined on-filed, but sent upstairs by Williamson. DRS has to consider whether Paine got his pad outside the line (he didn’t) and whether the ball would have bounced over the bails (it wouldn’t) which means the Aussie skipper has to depart for a well-made 79.148th over: Australia 434-5 (Head 99, Paine 79) Single to Paine, then a single to Head, a couple of dots, then Santner beats Paine for bounce before the skipper pinches a single to leave Head at the non-striker’s end on 99 at the start of the next over. Ian Loiterton (not using his wife’s phone today, it must be stressed) has combined storylines, roping in both Graeme Hick and dodgy declarations into this awkward moment in Ashes history.“This in response to an earlier tweet asking about declarations that left a batsman short of a milestone - from Wisden’s all time list of notorious declarations:In the mid-90s, England’s cricketers were on a downer. But contriving to sabotage a positive position in an Ashes Test was some effort, even by their standards. After bowling Australia out for 116 to lead by 198 on first innings, captain Mike Atherton wanted quick runs to set the Aussies a stiff target and have time to bowl them out again. But irritated by Graeme Hick’s slow scoring – 36 runs in 80 minutes on the fourth afternoon – he declared with Hick just two runs shy of a maiden Ashes century. The match petered out into a draw, and Hick allegedly refused to speak to Athers for the remainder of the tour.”Peter Kell is on the front line at the MCG, and the news is worrying. “After 3 o’clock, patrons at the bar in the Great Southern Stand are restricted to two beers per customer. They are serving weak mid-strength beer, hardly conducive to a mutiny. But there is a stampede for the urinals. Maybe the MCG is going retro as it’s US army camp days as Camp Murphy when it was dry and alcohol free? Maybe the corporate bars and areas are the only places to get full strength beer?”. Thoughts and prayers Peter, thoughts and prayers.Australia have progressively asphyxiated New Zealand during this Test and they tightened their grip during a dominant afternoon session. There is surely now only one possible winner in this match, all that remains to be seen is if the Kiwis can mount a rearguard with the bat to force a draw. Join us in about 20 minutes or so when we’ll find out if Head and Paine can raise their bats, and for an escalation in #Declarationspeculation. 147th over: Australia 431-5 (Head 98, Paine 77) Maiden from Boult. Head will have to stew over his brew during the tea break. 146th over: Australia 431-5 (Head 98, Paine 77) Head moves to 98 courtesy of another Santner over with all the menace of a mung bean. Can he sneak to three figures before Tea?145th over: Australia 428-5 (Head 96, Paine 76) Travis Head has toiled in the 90s like a studio engineer on a Smashing Pumpkins record. His wait for a ton is now in excess of 30 minutes. Michale Barker has joined in the #Declarationspeculation. “So, what’s the magic number for the declaration, or is it a magic time of the day today?” I reckon it’s a time thing. There are 34 overs left in the day. Australia would want around 15 of them at New Zealand I’d guess, so a declaration in around 20 overs or so feels right to me. Head cramping up on his way to a ton has confused matters, but I reckon Australia will come out after tea in T20 mode and blast it for an hour before jogging in. 144th over: Australia 422-5 (Head 95, Paine 76) Santner continues his filler overs. He is to Test bowling today what Diagnosis Murder or Escape To The Country are for TV schedulers.143rd over: Australia 417-5 (Head 92, Paine 74) Desperate to hold our attention Paine and Head almost conspire for a run out but the latter makes his ground following an unnecessarily tight single. Boult responds by flinging down the most fearsome couple of deliveries of the day - and perhaps the match - that will have Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson licking their lips. Both balls short, but not on Boult’s toes, and both had Travis Head hopping nervously and flinching inside the line. 142nd over: Australia 417-5 (Head 92, Paine 74) Santner, and New Zealand, going through the motions. Three off the over. This has sparked plenty of debate during the Test...141st over: Australia 414-5 (Head 91, Paine 72) Trent Boult replaces Neil Wagner in some forlorn attempt by Kane Williamson to convince us New Zealand remain committed to taking 20 wickets. The paceman goes for three in an over highlighted by a Paine drive that was timed sweetly but just reminded all involved that this multi-paced surface is far from a road. This, this is why I do this job.“Hi Jonathan,” hi Keith. “Your story about AEJ Collins smashing 628 not out reminded me of the last day of school back in 1988. Most of the kids didn’t turn up. Another teacher and myself set up the Kanga Cricket set and told the 20 or so kids around that they could have a bat when they got either Mr Hume or myself out. At little lunch, we were 394-0 and the fielding side had reduced to 14. By lunch, we had pushed on to 781-0. Humey had survived a couple of close LBW decisions and I had been caught off a no ball. Only six fielders returned after the main break and they lost interest when they discovered we weren’t going to declare. Not sure what the total was when the last kid gave up but we were well beyond a thousand. It sounds mean but we calculated that between us we had spent more than 230 lunchtimes that year coaching cricket and had become very adept at eating while standing.”140th over: Australia 411-5 (Head 91, Paine 69) Just the one from Santner’s latest over. 139th over: Australia 410-5 (Head 91, Paine 68) Wagner bowls some chin music to Paine, who is circumspect, until he hooks just short of fine-leg. Head then allows his thigh-pad to deflect four leg-byes. I reckon we’re 20-25 overs until the declaration, allowing Australia 15-20 overs at New Zealand tonight. 138th over: Australia 405-5 (Head 91, Paine 67) Nobody winced at any of Santner’s deliveries that over. So that’s a win, right? He’s still 0-68 from 15 overs this Boxing Day Test and clearly lost the confidence of his skipper though. Australia are now on 405 - the sum their batting coach achieved all on his own a few years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627570e811af89726a010482139e89637a9a69ce/0_364_5459_3276/master/5459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7903152f755731506e3e2b861c7e526","title":"south africa v england first test day two live","story":"It is especially poignant to read the report on the future of the Melbourne Test while England play in South Africa. It was only a couple of years ago that all grade cricket had to be cancelled in the Cape Town area because of drought, and the touring Indians were donating money to water charities. Drilling deep into the report, particularly prescient in Australia right now, with burning bush fires and controversy over the future of coal, it suggests that the Boxing Day Test will soon no longer be able to exist in its present form because of rising temperatures, and will have to be moved to the evening or a different time of year. Cricket Australia’s response: “Cricket is played in different climates and countries around the world and it is committed to both addressing the impact of climate change and ensuring cricket continued to be played in Australia on December 26 for many years to come.”Here is coverage from Day 2 of Australia v New Zealand and Travis Head’s century - as it happened.Good morning everyone! An intriguing day ahead at Centurion. While we wait for the coverage to start, a couple of things. Firstly, there is more sickness in the England camp to report - now Mark Wood joins Jack Leach, Ollie Pope, Chris Woakes and two members of support staff in the sick bay. Also, do read this important report into the future of the Boxing Day Test in this era of climate crisis. Tanya will be here soon. Here’s Sam Curran’s thoughts on the first day of play:“There was a special atmosphere out there with the band and the Barmy Army. It was pretty cool ... There is some nice carry here so you can nick the batters off and there is a bit of variation in the bounce.

What has changed on and off stage – and what’s next?I left drama school at the beginning of the decade, when the the best you could hope for was “colourblind” casting. Plays written by black people, for black actors, performed on main stages, were almost exclusively written by Americans, with some South African playwrights. You did have exceptions, like Bola Agbaje, coming through telling authentic stories. This year we have seen black British playwrights really make their mark. The idea of black work being a “risk” is redundant – the numbers don’t lie. Black theatre sells, and we have shown that if the work is varied, interesting and erse, black people will come. The excuses of “risk” and “sales” that venues have tried to fob black people off with have been proven to be nonsense, and are in fact racist. The artistic director appointments have given graduate Emma from a decade ago so much hope. I’m excited.Things have got better, but they were so damn bootleg before that nobody can afford to chill. Theatre-makers now seem less resistant to casting black actors in active and absorbing roles (instead of servants and best mates), but there’s still a dearth of black leads. The technical and production side of things seems quite wack, to be honest. I shouldn’t be able to count the number of black directors, designers, crew, stage management … There’s so much excellence out there, and I foresee a double boon that it deserves. Firstly, gatekeepers and audiences recognise and trust this excellence now, which should mean we can enjoy risk without any potential failure being attributed to our backgrounds. Secondly, we will tell stories challenging, subverting and enhancing the form and content, and we will do this loudly and confidently – no “tryin’ a ting” above some pub. I sincerely thank everybody I have worked with, ever. I’m so proud of our industry and humbly hope to continue until I cease to draw breath (but also: get on board with ersity and inclusion).Things have got better. I hope we increase in numbers, and stop becoming the minority backstage. I hope that black British people recognise working backstage as a legitimate career, and you can make a living. We should workshop it more to schools so people of colour know the career prospects exist. However, I believe this is slowly growing as black British people are producing more. That becomes a domino effect, where they try to seek a POC backstage team. Some amazing, thought-provoking, heartfelt work is being created. Plays I have worked on like Half Breed, Barber Shop Chronicles, Nine Night and Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner all have their own powerful messages. I feel that they are timeless and relevant to this era, and our generation.Black producers deserve better development opportunities to support other black makers to create authentic work. I see us moving and shape-shifting the sector massively. I’ve seen black producers move into executive roles, applying for artistic director roles, leading participation departments and becoming associates. I set up Black Ticket Project because I was really tired of the laziness around bringing in new audiences, especially in the midst of conversations around “ersity” – as if venues felt they had completed their due diligence by programming black artists, even if their audience remained really white. This was matched with a frustration of the way black working-class young people are treated by the sector as statistics and participants and not as the next generation of cultural creators. Who will pass on the legacy of theatre-going once our current, loyal audiences are gone? Black Ticket Project is not a revolutionary thing. It’s really simple. Organisations with much more infrastructure and resource than me could’ve done it.It can seem as though there is a lot of black theatre around, but when you take a closer look there is far less from black British authors. I have been following the work of a particular London theatre for a long time, but to my knowledge they haven’t produced the work of a single black British writer in the last decade. I have seen some great plays by African Americans there but never a black British writer.People have started to write historical plays – of which there are very few by black British playwrights. There are so many untold histories so I would see this becoming a trend over the next decade. I hope that stories about the black British experience will be written by writers who have experienced it and not be appropriated. How are black British writers to gain experience and skill if they are not given the opportunity to tell their own stories? There have been a couple of incidents in the last decade where the black writing community has been hit by being excluded from telling their own stories. I would like to see the continued revival of black British classics by writers such as Una Marson, Barry Reckord, Edgar White, Mustapha Matura … All these writers have sadly passed away and won’t answer back if a bright new director decides to do something surprising and wonderful with their plays.The optimist in me would say that the last decade has seen black voices move from the margins to the mainstream of British theatre. We now have black writers and directors regularly working on stages in our national theatres, our international festivals and in regional theatres up and down the country. I have no doubt that the new swathe of artistic directors, my contemporaries such as Lynette Linton, Roy Alexander Weise and Matthew Xia, will continue to push the boundaries in ensuring that everyone is represented in the work that is made.It must be said – or shouted from the rooftops – that all of this progress runs the risk of being stymied or reversed because of the continuing backdrop of financial austerity. I worry that boards will appoint artistic directors who programme in more conventional and “risk averse” ways. We need funding to take risks. We need to take risks to keep evolving the artform. And we need to keep evolving the artform to keep challenging, exciting and growing our audiences.It’s been a very exciting, earth-shaking year and I feel very privileged to have been a part of it. A couple of weeks ago Jane Fallowfield, the literary manager at the Royal Court, alluded to a new wave of writers who seem to be critiquing the establishment and traditional structures, while drawing inspiration from and paying homage to the artists who have come before them. I love the idea that we are drawing on past, present and maybe even the future to make our art. Every black British theatrical voice I hear when I go to the theatre feels so deeply rooted in authenticity. I think the most beautiful thing to observe is that it doesn’t feel like we’re explaining ourselves to people that don’t understand or haven’t attempted to make the imaginative leap to understand.Attention must be paid to expanding our definition of what black Britishness and – therefore black British theatre – can be. That means making space for LGBTQI+ and disabled voices in our digital and physical spaces. I saw Travis Alabanza’s Burgerz recently last week and was spellbound by the excellence and execution and the necessity of that story being told now. I’m so excited by the inclusion of a plethora of experiences and stories being told within the black British theatre landscape.Looking back in history too many of our predecessors have been ousted out of their rightful place and recognition because of the failure of traditional structures to keep a record of their achievements. When we archive not only can we educate, but we can also recognise the ground we are standing on is firm.The value, vitality and necessity of Tiata Fahodzi, Talawa, and the black theatre companies that came before them must not be underestimated for nurturing and giving a platform to black British theatre artists. All of us have benefited from the existence of these companies and the artists who founded and continue to run them. We’re now in a place where we have high-profile artists of colour heading major venues: Indhu Rubasingham at the Kiln, Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic, Roy Alexander Weise at Manchester’s Royal Exchange. Now is the time to be creatively bold. Anyone can make a bold political statement or choice. Making genuinely bold creative choices is a far trickier prospect.I am arguably a “poster boy” for black British theatrical success. Make no mistake: I didn’t “luck out” or “win the lottery” – it’s been hard earned and hard fought. One cannot argue with the success of the National Theatre’s Amadeus – but that doesn’t take into account the letters of complaint, online abuse, and downright vitriol directed towards me personally and the National as an organisation. The same can be said of me playing Iago at the RSC. Let’s make no bones here, all of the nay-saying when it comes down to it is purely because I am a black man. The colour of my skin. No account is taken of ability, of experience, of taste, of artistry, of preference, and yet I played those parts to commercial and critical acclaim. Theatregoers voted with their feet and their pockets. The real issue is that this country, culture and society has not yet fully dealt with race and empire. For me it isn’t about revisionism it’s about consistent, prickly, horrible, uncomfortable, robust conversations. To sum it all up: the day I am no longer referred to as “black British-Tanzanian-Zimbabwean actor” will be the day that the change is complete. We’re getting there, but we’re not there yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7074bfd1b20750b609698eeb81df8fe9c0a08ab/0_46_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f18bdc3527e7d23b117e4dd8a0c16af","title":"best ice rinks uk europe skating travel tips","story":"There’s nothing like skating in a beautiful European city for a blast of wintry fun, especially with a gløgg, glühwein or chocolat chaud to warm up with afterwardsThe Maritime Museum in Greenwich has opened an ice rink this year for the first time.

He’s been give the Mackenzie Crook treatment – and the result is a joyful, joke-filled eco-romp for our timesI have been struck by how many emails, texts and, occasionally, even face-to-face messages I have received since news broke that the BBC was to broadcast a Worzel Gummidge reboot over Christmas. All of them shared a single theme: how much they hated Worzel Gummidge as children. Not the book – no one, including me, seems to have read the source material, written by Barbara Euphan Todd and picked as the very first story to be published by a young upstart imprint called Puffin Books in 1941.It is the series that inspired fear and loathing in a considerable percentage of the demographic at whom the 1979 production was aimed, including me. It was partly the light, dry, flutteriness of Jon Pertwee’s Worzel. He was so papery and insubstantial that I didn’t feel I could place any trust in him, even before I found out that he had interchangeable heads. Never trust a man with interchangeable heads, kids. This is a rule I have cleaved to ever since and it has served me well. Beyond that, I, and my compatriots, simply found the series indefinably creepy. One says his overriding memory is of Worzel always being too close to the camera and forever poking his overlong fingers in people’s chests. I am certainly not going back to check.Now I needn’t, ever. For we have a new Worzel, a better Worzel, a Worzel who will surely lodge in the hearts of everyone, even those who have carried scarecrow scars there for 40 years.It is Mackenzie Crook’s Worzel Gummidge, in all senses. He – of course, of course it was his destiny – plays the birdscarer, in two hour-long adventures the actor has written himself. The first to air is The Scarecrow of Scatterbrook Farm in which John (Thierry Wickens, doing brilliant work in his debut performance) and his older sister Susan (India Brown, known as the excellent Lizzie in the adaptation of Jacqueline Wilson’s bestseller Hetty Feather) arrive from the city – as foster children, this time – for a stay with the Braithwaites.In pleasingly short order, they make the acquaintance of Worzel G. He has assumed they are fellow scarecrows because of how they are dressed. “Giveaway! Absolute triumph!” he tells them. “I know I’m a natty dresser, but I have never seen such a jumble of ill-fitting, oddball clothes so unfitted for the countryside!” He falls into a “sulk” – scarecrow speak for pretending to be lifeless whenever humans are around – but is coaxed out of it by the children’s offering of a cravat from a bag of clothes Mrs Braithwaite is giving to charity and by the urgency of “the weather situation”. The seasons are locked. Summer is going on too long the trees aren’t turning, the birds aren’t flying south and the harvest isn’t ripening – and the Braithwaites will lose everything if they cannot bring in their crops soon.Worzel holds the key, but he can’t remember what it is. They visit Aunt Sally (Vicki Pepperdine, with a wonderful cracked wooden face befitting her status as a former fairground attraction, now housed in a local museum), who tells him he needs to find it and gather the scarecrows of Albion before the harvest moon the following night to help him unlock the weather. They travel to the Tree of Tree (the one through which all winds and breezes pass – it’s in a supermarket car park) so it can send a message to everyone, but it is clogged with plastic bags. A temporary truce with the crows is called and they pull the bags free and push them into recycling bins. Worzel finds the key, the scarecrows gather to turn it, and all is well.It is an absolutely gorgeous, joyful mix of jokes, plot-with-just-enough-jeopardy, eco-messagery – beyond the plastic bags, a world of eternal summer heat is, of course, our current greatest fear – and modern updates (the children trying to blow out the lights in their new room because they assume that, as they are in the country, they are oil lamps, is emblematic of the deftness of touch that characterises the whole thing). And it manages to stay rooted in something older, too – even older than the 70s series, children. There is something of the ancient wildwood spirit conjured as the scarecrows gather and dance under the harvest moon something elemental is evoked, just lightly, just briefly, and you can feel folk memory rising. This is a Worzel for our time and maybe, just maybe, of all time too.And next up, on Friday night, there is Michael Palin as the Green Man. Surely, surely his destiny, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8be32693acaa7cd54ed608a18c640ccb26b845/0_42_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95d45ab9c13b04eec8bd1a86f9eda05c","title":"friday tv tonight richard osman world cup decade","story":"Richard Osman and guests take a look at the best of the past 10 years in a bumper night for panel shows.

But there were no reports of missile of other tests by the regime on Christmas Day.NHK was forced to apologise in January 2018 after mistakenly sending out a J-alert warning that North Korea had fired a missile.The error drew a rebuke from the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga. “J-alert provides extremely important information that affects the safety and security of Japanese citizens. We want NHK to do their utmost to prevent a recurrence,” Suga said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

Photograph: Eric Luke Many people will have an anecdote or two to illustrate why women live longer than men, but the gap in life expectancy has been closing over the last two decades according to new statistics from the Department of Health. Irish women on average lived 5.3 years longer than men in 1997, however this gap in life expectancy had closed to 3.6 years by 2017, the figures show. The Health in Ireland Key Trends 2019 statistics show overall people are living longer, with life expectancy increasing by nearly two and a half years since 2007. This increase was due to a drop in mortality rates and improvements in healthcare giving people better chances of surviving conditions such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. Life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84 years for women, the smallest gap between the sexes since the 1950s. As well as living longer than men, women aged 65 were more likely to be healthier than their male counterparts, according to the statistics. Irish men have had a higher life expectancy than the European Union average by more than a year for the last decade, the figures show. The statistics revealed despite a recent dip Ireland still has the third-highest fertility rate in the EU behind France and Sweden. The counties with the lowest fertility rates were Dublin, Cork and Kilkenny.Four out of five Irish people rated their own health as being good or very good, the highest in the EU. People with higher incomes were more likely to report better health compared to those from low-income households, according to the figures.

Photograph: Tom HonanVoters’ personal public service (PPS) numbers will be used to verify their identity as part of the most significant modernisation of the electoral register in more than a century.The Government has approved proposals for ground-breaking changes to the register including a single database rather than the current system where inidual local authorities have sole responsibility for the register in their area.The proposals will also allow pre-registration by 16- and 17-year-olds so they are automatically included on the register when they turn 18, the legal age for voting.The reforms include optional online registration where currently registration is exclusively on paper and improved provision for registration for those with no fixed address.In addition, a system of anonymous registration will be available for people whose safety may be at risk.The reforms also include removal of the “marked” or “edited register” that shows who voted in an election and which can be bought by political parties and others and is usually used for direct marketing.Minister for Local Government Eoghan Murphy said the changes represented the “most significant modernisation of the electoral registration process since 1918”.They “will allow for more responsive engagement with the public, more efficient administration and crucially, will protect the integrity of our electoral registration process into the future”, he said. Minister of State for Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan will bring the heads of a Bill or outline proposals to Cabinet early in the new year.He said the reforms were about “making the registration process more user-friendly and similar to the way people interact with other State services”.Controversial elementThe most controversial element is likely to be the requirement that voters show their PPS number to prove their identity as part of efforts to ensure the principle of “one person, one vote”. The number is the unique identifier for every inidual for public services, social welfare benefits and taxation matters.However, a data protection impact assessment and continuing engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commission on privacy issues will be part of the implementation process.Currently a person is not automatically removed from the register in one location if they move and register elsewhere and could potentially vote more than once.The measures also include limited data sharing between public bodies and local authorities for increased register accuracy “so that when someone changes details of address or name with one public body, their details on the electoral register would be automatically updated”, Mr Phelan said.FlexibilityHe has also published a report on the public consultation earlier this year, available at registerreform.gov.ie, which showed the public wanted flexibility in how people could register to maximise electoral participation.Identity verification, data protection and privacy are also key issues for the public. “Whilst people welcomed the idea of online registration, respondents felt that technical security, stability and resilience are critical issues,” Mr Phelan said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4124938.1577386532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record 900 000 passport applications in 2019 94 000 from uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMonthly  applications for Irish passports exceeded 100,000 in January, March, April and May 2019. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien A record breaking 900,000 passports have been issued this year, up more than 63,000 on 2018. As in previous years, there was a significant number of applicants – more than 94,000 – from Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. Applications exceeded 100,000 a month in January, March, April and May. At the height of demand more then 5,800 applications were submitted from around the world in a single day. Brexit saw a surge in demand for passports from Irish citizens living in the UK. The tallies for February and March cleared 11,000 each month coming up to a Brexit deadline. October also saw a surge to 7,208 ahead of another proposed – but missed – Halloween deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.Of the applications in 2019, 84,972 came from Dublin, while the county with the least number of applicants was Fermanagh, at 627. In all, almost 19,000 applications came from the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. The oldest online applicant was 101 and the youngest just five days old. The most popular baby girls’ names were Grace, Emily and Anna, while Jack, James and Noah topped the baby boys’ list. The most popular surname worldwide on applications was Murphy. CitizenshipThe number of people applying for citizenship through Foreign Births Registration continues to grow with more than 29,000 applications in 2019 and over 16,000 applications processed. This is the highest number ever registered in a single year. The Passport Office said it had revamped its service and that faster turnaround times included five working days for simple renewals, 10 working days for complex renewals and 20 working days for first-time applicants, excluding postage delivery time.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it was another “bumper year” for the passport service. Mr Coveney thanked passport office staff who he said offer “a modern, secure and efficient” service. “If you need to renew your passport, I encourage you to do so online and in the off-peak period, to ensure the shortest possible renewal time,” he said.

The Taoiseach says when he told Mr Johnson he expected the UK to pay for a Northern Ireland-Scotland bridge, Mr Johnson said the EU would pay for it. File photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire A Border poll on a united Ireland would be “defeated and isive” and would not be a good idea, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned.He said neither unionists nor parties supporting a united Ireland currently have a majority.Commitment to the Belfast Agreement, power-sharing in the North and cross-Border co-operation “all in a wider east-west context” is what is needed now, he said.They need to try and heal some of the isions and tensions that exist in the North “and among us all”.When the Assembly and Executive are up and running properly, that is the time “to have a long look and a long hard look at the institutional arrangements and the constitutional arrangements”.Speaking to the media at his annual Christmas press conference, Mr Varadkar ruled out a Border poll.He said there had been change in the past four elections – the Westminster general election, the European and local elections and the previous Westminster election in 2017.“For the first time since the foundation of Northern Ireland, unionist parties do not have a majority any more,” he said. “It wasn’t a one-off – it’s four elections now, of different sorts. But also, parties that support a united Ireland don’t have a majority either. “It’s still in and around 40 per cent and that is far short of the 50 per cent plus one you would need to win a Border poll and that’s why I don’t think a Border poll is a good idea. It would be defeated and isive. I don’t see who would gain from that sort of scenario.”‘Important’Mr Varadkar noted a “growing middle-ground, more people willing to vote for Alliance and Greens and PBP (People Before Profit) and other non-sectarian parties, if you like, particularly around the Belfast area, and that’s a significant development too”.But he stressed that in looking at constitutional arrangements it was “important to do that right”. He said it should be done in the context where the Assembly and Executive were up and running and where the Belfast Agreement was “functioning as it was intended and then see whether there’s a time for a change or reforms on foot of that”.Asked about the prospect of a Citizens’ Assembly, Mr Varadkar reiterated his view that any forum or assembly that did not involve “at least some decent section of unionist opinion wouldn’t be the right approach”. “We have to learn from our history and we have to understand that there are a million people on this island who are British and are unionists and we need to respect that and make sure that they are part of the future and that they are accommodated and that they feel part of the future.” BridgeMr Varadkar also supported the idea of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland but insisted that the UK would have to pay for it. He said there should be a “high-level engineering assessment as to whether it is a viable proposal”.But the Taoiseach said that when he told the British prime minister he expected the UK to pay for the 30km bridge, Boris Johnson replied: “No, no the EU is going to pay for it”.“So that’s definitely not going to happen, because neither Northern Ireland or Scotland are going to be in the EU.”An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4124731.1577376695!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar bridge between north and scotland worth examining but uk must pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson in Government Buildings, Dublin.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA The Taoiseach has said he will not dismiss the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, but insisted the UK must pay for it.British prime minister Boris Johnson and the Democratic Unionist Party have spoken in favour of the idea. Last week Mr Johnson described it as a “very interesting idea”, adding: “Watch this space.”Leo Varadkar said he had discussed the idea with Mr Johnson recently, revealing he told the prime minister it was “worth examining”.But the Taoiseach said he had also told Mr Johnson he would expect the UK to pay for it.“At which point he suggested, ‘no, no, the EU is going to pay for it’,” Mr Varadkar said.“So that’s definitely not going to happen, because neither Northern Ireland or Scotland are going to be in the EU. But it was kind of half serious, half joking in a way.“But all messing aside, I do think at the very least a high-level engineering assessment should be done as to whether it is a viable proposal.”Other parties have been less enthusiastic about the idea, with Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken saying investment was urgently needed in Northern Ireland’s infrastructure first.Mr Varadkar said: “I know people dismiss these things out of hand, but they used to dismiss the Channel Tunnel as well — the idea of building a tunnel between France and Britain — and I know what I see when I see a bridge tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, when you fly over New Orleans and you see 110 miles of bridge, it’s extraordinary,” he said.“I think we need to at least check out is this viable in engineering terms and how much money it would cost to do.”However Mr Varadkar said he is more interested in talking to Mr Johnson about other projects the two nations could work on together, such as a high-speed rail link connecting Dublin, Belfast and Cork, and better connections to the north west.He suggested hourly trains between the cities as well as improving the A5 road to Derry and Donegal. Mr Varadkar said he was also interested in the idea of a cross-border university, involving the Ulster University campus at Magee in Derry with Letterkenny IT, as well as the greenway projects and the Ulster Canal.“There are actually loads of really good projects we could do together that might not cost as much and would definitely be more feasible than a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland,” he said.“But in my pursuit of those ones I’m not going to dismiss the one that the prime minister’s particularly keen on.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It wasn\u0027t an attempt to bring down the Royals, just a chance to understand the story.She added: I didn\u0027t like people saying, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s a car crash interview,\u0027 because I thought, \u0027That\u0027s not enticing, that\u0027s not encouraging.\u0027 I don\u0027t want people thinking that\u0027s what happens at Newsnight.Maitlis said the impression she got from Prince Andrew was definitely that he had been happy with the interview. She said it was not up to her to decide whether he was being truthful because it\u0027s not my job.I\u0027m not a judge, I\u0027m not a barrister, this isn\u0027t a court of law, she added.

Regardless of which forces are really driving bitcoin\u0027s holiday behaviour, it seems as though bitcoin remains sensitive to major US holidays for the time being.Other cryptocurrencies also experienced positive price movements over the weekend, including ether\u0026nbsp(ethereum), XRP (ripple) and bitcoin cash. These altcoins are even more prone to huge price swings than the notoriously volatile bitcoin.Historically this has been a time when traders do look at altcoins and therefore volatility may increase, Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm Luno, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Analysis of the latest price increase led some cryptocurrency analysts to predict further gains over the coming days.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast.

Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed.

Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display. Roku, which spent $150m\u0026nbsp(£115m) this fall buying software provider Dataxu to help companies plan and buy ad campaigns, then shares insights about the audience with the company behind the ad.Created with Sketch.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We need an overall culture shift to happen.“There is still a pressure to participate in these initiations and hazing – and the peer pressure encourages excessive drinking. Students are still taking risks.”She added that simply banning initiation activities is not enough as the evidence shows that students are still holding the events outside the knowledge of the universities.\u0026nbspStudents ‘forced to eat maggots and dog food’ in hockey initiationIt is hoped that an anonymous reporting system online – to be launched in January by governing body British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) – will help students and parents to speak out about these events taking place.\u0026nbspVince Mayne, chief executive of BUCS, said: “We need to make a mass movement that this is universally not acceptable. It is not just unacceptable at one or two universities. It is right across the piste.”Speaking to The Independent, he warned that initiations across UK campuses have now reached “extreme levels”, adding that some of the “worst cases of hazing” have come over from the US.He added: “There are issues with severity and I would link that to awareness through social media: ‘If X university has done that then I am going to make sure mine is even worse than that at my university.’\u0026nbsp“So I think that has raised the stakes for people to outdo one another, which is not a healthy situation to get into. They see what is happening elsewhere and they try to copy it or outdo it.”The organisation is working with academics on a programme called Changes – Challenging Hazing and Negative Group Events in Sport – which trains students about the consequences of initiation activities.\u0026nbspFather of student who died at university initiation event speaks out‘Anyone involved in university initiations should be expelled’Universities must do more to teach about dangers of initiationsProfessor Moira Lafferty, who developed the scheme being rolled out at universities across the UK, said she believes initiations have become more dangerous as students are consuming more alcohol than before.\u0026nbsp“Challenges used to be around lager and cider and now you look at it, the alcohol consumption is absolutely horrific. More people drink spirits now than they used to and there is more extreme alcohol consumption,” said Professor Lafferty, of the psychology department at the University of Chester.But she believes universities are beginning to take action. Since Changes launched in 2018, more than 40\u0026nbspinstitutions have taken part in educational workshops. And in September, Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-chancellors, launched advice calling for institutions to adopt more training on initiations.\u0026nbspThe guidance from UUK said universities need to do more to educate students about the dangers of these rituals and excessive drinking to prevent any more tragic deaths from taking place in the future.A UUK spokesperson said: “It is vital that university is a safe and positive experience for everyone. No one should feel pressured into risky behaviours, on or off campus.\u0026nbsp“Working together with Newcastle University, we recently released new advice for universities and students on the dangers of initiations.“This sets out what universities can do to better protect students and encourage long-term behavioural change, and includes examples of good practice across the sector.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Student housing charity Unipol says up to 2,000 students have faced disruption this year.\u0026nbspFigures from the charity show that 23 private student accommodation blocks being built across the UK were not completed in time for the start of term, compared with\u0026nbsp13 developments last year.Dylan Thomson, deputy president of Liverpool Guild of Students, said students were left “stressed and anxious” when they were told just a day before moving that their rooms would not be ready.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHundreds of students were affected by delays to two private student accommodation blocks in the city. Mr Thomson told The Independent: “Many of the students were first years and already feeling nervous. Disruption in the first few weeks of university life, which is already a stressful period, was made worse.\u0026nbsp“This left some students feeling unsettled and isolated which made it difficult to find friends.”Durham students put into temporary accommodation days before arrivingMeanwhile, in Portsmouth a group of students were placed in hotels a 30-minute drive from the university following delays to private accommodation at the start of term.\u0026nbspSome students in the city have been moved three times – and a few are still in temporary rooms three months after the start of term, Helena Schofield, president of Portsmouth Students’ Union, said.\u0026nbspShe added: “It has affected their studies as they have spent a lot of time emailing private companies and it has been really unsettling and distressing for them.”The rise in students affected by building delays this year comes amid huge expansion across universities.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay up to £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population at a time when student numbers at institutions are uncapped.Kate McIntosh, president of the students’ union at Durham University, where 108 students were placed in temporary accommodation this term amid delays, said: “At the university, and in the sector as a whole, there needs to be serious questions asked about where student welfare comes into the conversation when we’re talking about building works and expansion.“The university is committed to expanding and building new colleges but at the first hurdle they have fallen because they’ve had over 100 students not in their bed at freshers’ week. It is a complete failure.”The data, obtained by\u0026nbspThe Independent, shows that universities have offered students fruit hampers and supermarket and laundry vouchers to make up for accommodation delays.\u0026nbspBut the National Union of Students (NUS) says institutions need to do more. Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at NUS, said: “There should be mandatory compensation. It is not really a gift if you are giving someone laundry vouchers when the flat they were meant to have had a washing machine.”She told The Independent: “A lot of universities are trying to abdicate their responsibility of accommodation for students. They act like it’s only private providers problems.“Universities are making a lot of money from the fees students are paying but they are not putting that money into building the infrastructure to support the number of students they are then going to house.”Student plans commute from Amsterdam to Bristol amid housing shortageMs Crossan Jory added: “Universities need to realise it’s not just a person sitting in a classroom – it’s all that goes along with moving to a new city or town and having to live somewhere.”In October, universities minister Chris Skidmore urged student accommodation providers to come together to ensure “failures” did not happen again following reports of delays across the UK.\u0026nbspA Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said the organisation was aware of the issues and challenges surrounding student accommodation and was “working to address them”.The spokesperson said: “To address some immediate challenges, particularly around consumer protections, we need to explore where strengthening regulation can help and make clear where responsibilities lie for accommodation quality and welfare.“It is important that all providers – whether the accommodation is university-owned and managed or run by private sector organisations – meet high standards, demonstrate value, take into account the mental health and wellbeing of students and are accountable to students.”Mr Skidmore said: “Students pay significant amounts for accommodation and housing can affect student welfare.“That is why providers who fail to complete projects on time – and provide adequate alternative provision – need to be held accountable.“With the number of students expected to rise sharply due to demographic changes in the 2020s, we must sharpen our focus on how we will deliver and regulate student accommodation in the years to come.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain.

Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Another said:\u0026nbspEven if it offends just one person\u0026nbspthen that’s one person too many.Other viewers didn\u0027t see the harm in using the word.Jones defended the use of the word, arguing that the moment stayed true to the characters.She said: Characters in Gavin \u0026amp Stacey are kind and big-hearted, I believe.

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

They say – especially young kids – they say, ‘I just saw you on the movie.’ They don’t see me on television as they do in the movie.“I was a little younger, to put it mildly,” he added. “It was an\u0026nbsphonour\u0026nbspto do it.”He continued: “It turned out to be a very big hit, obviously. It’s a big Christmas hit – one of the biggest. So it’s an\u0026nbsphonour\u0026nbspto be involved in something like that. You always like to see success.”In 2017, Matt Damon revealed the bizarre reason Trump filmed several cameo roles back in the 1990s.Home Alone, which is set to be remade for Disney+, features on our ranking of the greatest festive films of all time.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry.

The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. “As humans we are imperfect,” he can be heard saying in a teaser “super trailer” for his 2020 plans.“My past, my mistakes, all the things that I\u0027ve been through… I believe that I\u0027m right where I\u0027m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me.”The promo video finds Bieber, wearing his trademark baggy hoodie and woolly hat, sitting outside a petrol station and wandering around a trailer park near Los Angeles as he contemplates his next move.Ariana Grande releases new live album ‘k bye for now’The 50 best albums of 2019Justin Bieber shares contrite Instagram message about personal growthEarlier this year, Bieber wrote about his struggles with drug use and depression in an emotional essay, in which he described himself as “the most hated person in the world”.“I feel like this is different from the previous albums just because of where I\u0027m at with my life,” he goes on in the video. “I\u0027m excited to perform it and to tour it.“We all have different stories, I\u0027m just excited to share mine.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

About £4m had been paid in compensation to people affected by the prior ban, according to an internal MoD report.This month an MoD spokesperson told The Independent: “We are aware of fewer than 200 cases in which iniduals may have been dismissed on the grounds of their sexuality, although we accept that there may be cases that aren’t known about.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

In 2007-08 alone, the MoD settled a tranche of 57 cases a further 20 were concluded between 2003 and 2010. Overall, 159 claims were made, with some rejected and others withdrawn, the FoI response said.It comes just weeks after the government admitted it had treated former royal navy radio operator Joe Ousalice “in a way that would not be acceptable today” when he was forced out of the senior service in 1993.Falklands War veteran Mr Ousalice, who is bisexual, was also stripped of a long service and good conduct medal when he was discharged. The award will now be returned to him, following court action that concluded earlier this month.Other former service members can apply for medals lost in similar circumstances to be reinstated.The MoD spokesman added: “Any iniduals who forfeited a medal in connection with an offence, for which they are able to obtain a disregard under the terms of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, will need to apply for the restoration of the medal under the terms of the policy being operated by the Cabinet Office.“Cases will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ministers should be doing all they can to put this right.”In a written answer to a parliamentary question in January, defence minister Tobias Ellwood said that “since the lifting of the ban on LGBT personnel serving in the military in the year 2000, the MoD has welcomed and supported all personnel, irrespective of sexual orientation, actively celebrating and supporting the ersity of all our personnel.”He added: “Support is available including through LGBT champions, senior LGBT role models, active LGBT networks and over 150 personnel trained by Stonewall as LGBT allies.”All three branches of the forces are ranked by Stonewall, a leading campaign group, as among its top 100 employers.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Using power tools to gain entry, officers confiscated laptops and other electronic equipment. According to Mr Navalny, the raid was linked to\u0026nbsphis refusal to comply with a court order and delete an investigation into prime minister Dmitry Medvedev from his YouTube site.\u0026nbspThe arrest itself was not unusual: over the last calendar year, Mr Navalny has spent one in every eight days in police cells. But it followed the more extraordinary news that one of his employees had been seized at his home and dispatched to a remote military base in the Arctic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRuslan Shaveddinov, 23, was detained on Monday night at his home in Moscow. Colleagues only raised the alarm upon discovering the door of his\u0026nbspapartment had been forced open. Mr Shaveddinov had not been able to contact either them or a lawyer: his mobile phone was mysteriously\u0026nbspdisabled.\u0026nbspBefore his own arrest three days later, Mr Navalny suggested that the order to arrest Mr Shaveddinov came from the very top.“It seems Putin put together the operation to isolate our Ruslan,” Mr\u0026nbspNavalny wrote on Twitter. “His SIM card was blocked, the security service broke down his door and he was whisked away on several planes.”\u0026nbspNew details on mass shooting reveal dark underbelly of Russian armyFor many hours, there was no news about Mr Shaveddinov’s whereabouts. The first clues came from social media channels with close links to the security services. These\u0026nbsppublished footage showing the activist being led with his belongings into a minivan with a “VIP” sign. The snow on the roads –\u0026nbspthe winter in European Russia is unseasonably warm –\u0026nbspsuggested he was somewhere in the Russian north.\u0026nbspEventually, on Tuesday, Mr Shaveddinov was declared found, 3,500 miles away at an air defence base in the Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya.\u0026nbspNovaya Zemlya is known for its severe, windswept climate the home of polar bears, ice and permafrost. It was also the location for tests of the largest atomic bomb\u0026nbspin history in 1961. The tests happened at the north of the archipelago. The base where Mr Shaveddinov has been sent is at the southern tip, and specialises in Russia’s top-of-the-range S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft systems.\u0026nbspWhen it finally came round to admitting details, the Kremlin was unapologetic. The form of the conscription did not leave a shadow over the Russian army, spokesperson\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov insisted.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile forced conscription is unusual in Moscow, it is not the first time that authorities have used strong-arm tactics against the opposition. In 2007, for example, Oleg Kozlovsky, now a researcher for Amnesty, was seized and sent away for military service. He successfully appealed against the conscription, however, and was freed\u0026nbsptwo and a half months later.\u0026nbspMr Kozlovsky told The Independent that he had heard of several cases similar to his own, but suggested that the “outrageous” nature of this week’s operation –\u0026nbspthe Arctic destination, timing and form of arrest – was designed to shock.\u0026nbsp“Breaking down doors is what you do with dangerous criminals,” he said.One year’s military service is compulsory for all Russian males aged 18 to 28, but exemptions are possible. At the time of his forced conscription, Mr Shaveddinov had lost an appeal against the draft on medical grounds.\u0026nbspValentina Melnikova, the head of the Russian Union of Committees of Soldiers\u0027 Mothers, was critical of the tactics used by Mr Shaveddinov and his lawyers. He should have taken precautions, she said –\u0026nbspfor example by living elsewhere for a time. That said, authorities had “clearly” sidestepped due process in sending Mr Shaveddinov to the Arctic.\u0026nbsp“The authorities did not do things by the book, which makes this a kidnapping,” she said. “Unfortunately, it’s part of a growing trend of lawless behaviour by the Ministry of Defence.”\u0026nbspAccording to Ms Melnikova,\u0026nbspa culture of violent bullying and criminal behaviour is also on the rise. In October, a Russian conscript killed eight of his fellow soldiers after apparently being subjected to bullying by his commanders. It was but the most shocking of dozens of such cases, she said.\u0026nbspGiven his political\u0026nbspstatus, however, Mr Shaveddinov will likely avoid such humiliation.“The commanders will do everything they can to avoid scandals … and to keep him away from the missiles,” his fellow activist Oleg\u0026nbspKozlovsky suggested.“That said, I imagine Putin won’t be flying over the Arctic Ocean any time soon.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The apparent victory means that Mr Netanyahu will lead Likud into March elections.Official results will be announced on Friday but partial results reported by Israeli TV stations showed Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0026nbspcapturing between 70 and 80 per cent of the vote – trouncing his challenger.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“A giant victory,” Mr Netanyahu tweeted, just over an hour after polls closed.“Thanks to the members of Likud for the trust, support and love,” he said. “God willing, I will lead Likud to a big victory in the coming elections.”The prime minister’s\u0026nbspleadership has been shaken by corruption charges against him and a failure to form a government.Mr Netanyahu twice failed to build a ruling coalition after elections in April and September,\u0026nbspleading to the unprecedented third vote this spring.He has also faced a backlash over continued escalations and heavy exchanges of fire between militants in Gaza and Israel’s security\u0026nbspforces over the last year.As the prime minister campaigned in the southern city of Ashkelon on Wednesday, he was forced to flee the stage when a rocket fired from Gaza\u0026nbspset off sirens.\u0026nbspIsrael to be investigated for war crimes in Palestinian TerritoriesIt was the second time\u0026nbsphe has been bundled off stage due to incoming\u0026nbspfire – he was rushed to a rocket shelter\u0026nbspin the nearby city of Ashdod in September.But despite the difficulties\u0026nbspand the shadow of corruption indictment, the premier remains a popular figure within the right-wing party.​Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’s hanging on to stitch up the leadership for hard-left candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey.Some of his supporters set up a Twitter campaign called #JeremyWasRight!What planet are they on  They just suffered the biggest battering for almost a century.Let me spell it out for them. You were wrong.Wrong to block Brexit. Wrong to present a manesto costing billions. And wrong to ask Britain to vote for an unelectable old leftie.But none of the candidates to replace Corbyn seem to understand why they suffered such a crushing defeat.Keir Starmer praised Corbyn’s “radicalism” and said Labour should build on his disastrous approach.And let’s not forget he sat in Corbyn’s top team as decent MPs were driven out and the party was poisoned by racism and extremism.Emily Thornberry launched her campaign by suggesting Labour should have blocked the election. The rest of us thought they needed a leader the country could vote for.Along with Rebecca Long-Bailey and David Lammy, she nominated Corbyn for the leadership — and that should rule all of them out of replacing him.There’s another long list of candidates for deputy leader.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be. The Andrew scandal is far from over and  could be a pivotal year for the Duke, who has yet to face the FBI.So when you watch the Queen give her Christmas message tomorrow afternoon, spare a thought for someone who has served this country so dutully and for so long.An amazing woman of true decency and honour.We remain lucky to have her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers.

Harrison didn’t say why the boy was released.A police spokesman declined to provide details, saying “the investigation remains active and ongoing.”A spokesman for Neighborhood Defender Service confirmed that the organization is providing the boy with legal representation but declined to comment further.The case has become embroiled in controversy after the head of the NYPD sergeants’ union Ed Mullins claimed Tessa was in the park buying weed on the night she was killed.Mullins made the comments while discussing NYC crime rates on John Catsimatidis radio show, The Cats Roundtable.But Tessas family and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio accused the union boss of blaming Tessa for her own death.Her family told NBC: The remarks by Sergeants Benevolent Association president Ed Mullins we find deeply inappropriate.They intentionally or unintentionally direct blame onto Tess, a young woman, for her own murder.He later said his words had been twisted by the Mayor and apologized to Tessa’s family.Some city leaders have urged police to use caution in investigating Majors’ death to avoid repeating mistakes made with the Central Park Five — a group of five black and Hispanic teens wrongfully convicted of a  rape.Harrison said in a tweet that the youth taken into custody Thursday had lawyers present “for the entire investigative process.”At a press conference last week, he said the youths previously questioned in the Majors case had s present and were told of their right to a lawyer.The Legal Aid Society, which represents the first arrested youth, said detectives should have waited until he had a lawyer before questioning him.In the wake of Majors’ death, Barnard and Columbia faculty have reported receiving “abhorrent and viciously racist” robocall messages from a white supremacist organization, and a Connecticut man was arrested after police say he posted online that he was going to kill the suspected stabber.Majors played in a rock band, sported green hair and had told an editor from a newspaper internship in high school that she planned to take journalism classes in college.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Foy was treated for a broken arm at Royal Stoke University Hospital. He also sustained grazes to his knee, elbow, leg and shoulder. Now the pensioner - who was categorised as a category three patient - is calling for the system to be changed so the elderly are not left lying in a road for so long. A category three means it is aposurgent but not le threateningapos and promises a response within  minutes. Mr Foy said: “When the ambulance arrived, the paramedic said, ‘I am so sorry we were so long but you are category three’. I do not really class myself as vulnerable but I should be. If it had been anyone  it could have cost them their lives. A -year-old should not be category three when he is lying in the road in the rain.  “It is a disgrace. It is not down to the people.

He added: “I do not want it to happen to anyone . I do not want to see anyone die as a result of the system being flawed.” While he waited, kind strangers tried to make him as comfortable as possible.  “A van driver made me a pillow and covered me with his jacket.

But Andrew was widely condemned for his unsympathetic tone and lack of remorse about the friendship when grilled by BBC presenter Emily. He was also mocked for claiming he is medically unable to sweat and that he could not have had sex with his accuser because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey.Emily said the Palace later informed the Newsnight team it thought they had done a “fair job”. Of the Prince, she said: “The impression I got was definitely that he had been happy with it.” Andrew stepped down from official public duties following the backlash.

James Heather had waited hours outside St Mary Magdalene Church, patiently hoping for the chance to gt them to the young royal. He had handpicked the flowers for Charlotte, with mum Nakita saying he was left starstruck by Charlotte. The Princess reportedly became shy around James, but was clearly very happy with her present, Nakita said. She had joined her parents at the am service at St Mary Magdalene Church for the first time yesterday. After leaving the church, Charlotte chatted to members of the crowd alongside her mum Kate. The four-year-old was handed ious presents by well-wishers - including a handmade Christmas angel. But Jamesapos roses, chosen because they are also his mumaposs most-loved flower, were clearly a firm favourite. Revealing Charlotteaposs reaction to the gt, Nakita, from Norwich, said the moment between the two children was adorable. She told : Weaposd been queuing since about half eight and James was really keen to see Charlotte. James managed to get to the front and was just stood there with his flowers. He had chosen the flowers himself and picked those because he knows they are my favourite. When they left the church, Kate came over and said, aposare these for Charlotte apos and then James said aposyesapos and handed them over. Charlotte looked really shy and coy, but you could tell she was happy and then she said aposthank youapos. James was so excited, but I think he was quite starstruck by her. As Charlotte walked away, she was seen clutching the roses before refusing to hand them to a royal aide who had offered to carry them.

And while she generally remains publicly on neutral ground in terms of politics, some experts believe her annual address to the nation hinted at her own views on the Brexit debacle.For her speech, pre-recorded at Buckingham Palace and shown after her husband Prince Philip, , was released from hospital, Queen Elizabeth wore a royal blue cashmere dress and a sapphire and diamond brooch. Academics have interpreted this as her way of showing support for remaining in the European Union, due to the outfitaposs similarity to the EU flag. The brooch, originally a present from Prince Albert to Queen Victoria on the eve of their  wedding, has a deep blue stone surrounded by  diamonds, mirroring the flagaposs circle of stars.Taking to Twitter, academic Dr James Anderson said: The Queen has full editorial control of the Queen’s Speech and can choose wether or not to give one. She chose not to in .So treat the speech as her personal views, right down to her choice of an EU blue dress and an EU stars broach. While Dr Geoff Jones used a picture of the monarch during the speech and wrote: Her Majesty yet again doing what little she can to show her support for the European Union.Another twitter user pointed out she wore the same brooch when she addressed the European Parliament in . But other twitter users arenapost so sure. Jan Davies wrote: More likely the blue was chosen to stand out against the background that Sapphire brooch was a gt from Albert to Victoria.Taken as a whole with the photos of her father, husband  next  heirs, I think sheaposs emphasising family  continuity. During her speech, the Queen reflected on the th anniversary of the D-Day landings, an event which helped to turn the tide of the Second World War in the Alliesapos favour. Victory, of course, paved the way for a united Europe.  Prince Albert himself was born near Coburg in Germany, with the royals, since the turn of the last century, descending directly from our European neighbours. They were even forced to change their name to Windsor from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha during the First World War. The Queenaposs heritage is very much rooted in mainland Europe, perhaps going some way to explaining her apparent support for remaining in the EU. The Prince Albert brooch itself also symbolises true love, having been a present shared between a couple soon-to-be married, which could have been selected to show Elizabethaposs support for her own husband during his bout of ill health. During her address, she described  as quite bumpy, with the last  months including Prince Andrewaposs car crash interview about his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.There has also been Prince Harry and Megan Markleaposs struggle with public le and reports of a rt between the couple and Prince William and Kate."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who couldnt recognise herself","story":"NewsWoman who couldnt recognise herself in holiday snap loses  stoneKate McDonough, from Liverpool, was on a break to the Czech Republic when her boyfriend took a picture that would inspire her weight loss journeyShareCommentsByCheryl Mullin:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsKate McDonough lost  stone after looking at this picture \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

I just didn’t recognise myself.” The -year-old continued: “I’d always been a bit bigger than everyone , a bit curvier ... I just wasn’t happy with the way I looked.

Slimming World meals could be enjoyed by the whole family, and dishes that were firm favourites prior to starting the plan could still be enjoyed.  Kate continued: “I was in a bit of a vicious circle in that I was eating when I was happy, eating when I was sad ... everything just involved food, which is fine, I was just doing it in the wrong way. “I found the plan really easy. I’m not fussy anyway, I love fruit, veg - all types of food. “There’s lots of things to help you, andyou don’t like fruit and veg it’s not the end of the world, there’s lots of tips to help you.” As Kate lost weight, she found the confidence to join a local gym, and now enjoys running and lting weights.

She said: My husband and I would very much love to have our dream wedding at Florida Walt Disney World Resort. However between bills and our children we just donapost have enough money saved up, itaposs close to impossible it seems like to save back money when you have children. Seven to be exact. The mum then confessed sheaposd reached out to Disney to seethey would help cover the costs - but sheaposs yet to hear back from them. Due to his recent heart attack we would like as much help as possible to make this happen, she continued. Weaposd also like for his grandmother to be able to attend. She would need her nurse there with her so we would need to be able to cover those expenses as well as the hotel stays, food, transportation, gas money for those in their own vehicles and then the resort. She added: We are doing our best to set back what we can but we figured weaposd ask for some help along the way.

Karina Chikitova, who clung on to her loyal puppy, fought to stay alive in a forest full of brown bears and wolves. The promising ballerina celebrates her th birthday on Boxing Day and has already won the Mini Miss Yakutia contest. In August  she was found after a dozen days and nights lost in the remote taiga, sleeping on a bed of long grass and eating wild berries to stay alive. Karina had followed her father into the woods but he had no idea she was trailing him. Then just four years old, she cuddled her mongrel puppy Naida for warmth in the shivering cold before the dog found its way home to a remote village, urging rescuers not to give up, and to go and find the little girl. Karina’s ordeal was seen as so remarkable that a statue was erected of her and the dog in regional capital Yakutsk. A popular children’s book was also written about her, and her fame as a Mowgli seems to have led this remote village girl to amazing new opportunities. Karina was “excited” after she easily won the Mini Miss contest in a social media poll, making her a young ambassador for Yakutia, Russia’s diamond region, the coldest inhabited place in the world. She is seen as a promising ballerina, already studying full time in Yakutsk, some  miles from her home. Now she has been invited in  to Moscow to meet leading ballet stars including world famous dancer Nikolay Tsiskaridze, now rector of the world famous Vaganova Academy. “I want to become a ballerina and dance Swan Lake,” she said. “I have also learned how to play the jaw harp and piano.”  Bi-lingual Karina is doing well at school, too, where she has a talent for maths, and is learning English to add to her fluent Yakut and Russian. Herin Yakutsk, Albina Cherepanova, , said: “She may become a ballet dancer.” Globally-renowned fashion designer Irina Krutikova promised Karina a fur coat to keep warm in her region where temperatures plunge in winter to minus °C. When she was found her rescuer Artyom Borisov said: “She was sitting deep in deergrass, completely silent.  “I didn’t actually notice her. She saw me and stretched her arms forward. I picked her up, she was so tiny, so light, like fluff. She didn’t have shoes on. Her face, legs and arms were bitten to blood . “She was dead scared. Straight away she asked to for water and food, and burst into tears.

He told RIA Novosti: “She was a very talented pianist, receiving three international awards in the past three years. “In March , she had planned a tour in Japan.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as

coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

North Ireland has its own very dferent politics. Among other places London voted Labour as did Wales. Scotland also voted dferently, with about a third of the electorate voting for the SNP. Wales and London seem to accept that although they didnrsquot vote for the Government we have now got, the UK as a whole did.Scotlandrsquos problem, and it is a problem, is that we have relapsed into an SNP led victim mode. The cringeworthy wailing that we are being ignored, that this is all an outrage, that somehow the panto Tory villains have done us in - itrsquos just embarrassing.In contrast to those in England , who are more positive, business people in Scotland are much less so. They cannot take the view that political uncertainty is behind us and start planning for growth. They dread the SNPrsquos disruptive agenda.They know the SNPrsquos currency plans are undeliverable and carry many dangers, they know that England is four times as important a market for Scotland as the rest of the EU world isand that disrupting frictionless access to that market would be catastrophic for Scotlandrsquos prosperity. They fear that given free rein the SNPrsquos interventionist instincts and spending plans coupled with Scotlandrsquos large budget deficit would mean interference in their business and crushing taxation on their company and their family.So what is a rational business person in Scotland forced to consider now instead of focusing solely on growing their business   The answer is that they start to think of moving activity and themselves out of Scotland.I am not suggesting that business investment will cease or that all those who run and own businesses will leave in January. That wonrsquot happen but what those who support independence fail to realise is that there are few really large businesses which are only active in Scotland, they have activities well beyond it and the choice of where investment goes is affected by political uncertainty. There are also few owners of large businesses in Scotland who are here all the time - they travel extensively, they might have a home in London or abroad as well as in Scotland, almost certainly some of their family will live outside Scotland. For these people it is quite easy to slightly sht where they spend their weekends, where their business is run from or where they build a new factory to a place outside Scotland.:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodThe SNP has no mandate for a second referendum and the uncertainty caused by constantly calling for one will result in Scotland being less prosperous.

Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers.

Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain.

He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists.

This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes.

ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels.ldquoIn taking this decision we have approved a report which we will be commending to next yearrsquos General Assembly, recommending that the Church sells its shares in oil and gas companies as a matter of urgency.He added: ldquoWe are being warned that this is a critical time for the world, a turning point when we must make a change in order to arrest man-made climate change and the ongoing loss of habitat and species upon which all le depends.ldquoAs Christians we believe we have a duty to care for Godrsquos earth.ldquoWe are running out of time, and people may argue that our inidual actions do not amount to much, but our faith and history tells us that transformation is possible when peoplersquos actions begin to chime with their faith.Controversy over the Kirkrsquos investments in fossil fuels has caused signicant internal debate over the last few years.It comes amid increasing awareness and concern for the environment, with Nicola Sturgeon declaring a climate emergency at the SNPrsquos conference in Edinburgh in April.Reverend Gordon Strang of Cromdale Kirk in Strathspey proposed a move to disinvest at the General Assembly the following month, but this was narrowly rejected.Rev Frazer said the position of the General Assembly has been that it is better to engage with these companies than to disinvest.He added: ldquoThese are not easy tensions to navigate but increasingly, as the impact of what we are doing to the planet becomes more apparent, they must be navigated and urgently.The Church and Society Councilrsquos call came at its last meeting before it is merged into a new agency provisionally named the Faith Impact Forum.The move forms part of a wider restructure of the Kirk intended to place it on a surer footing for the future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10835627.jpg?type=article-full","title":"camley-cartoons-best-images-2019","story":"From lampooning the

discovered in the British Isles ndash growing unassumingly on a gravel road in the Highlands of Scotland.It is not known how long the moss-like plant has been resident north of the Border and it may never have been spotted but for a lucky encounter with a lichen expert working with Scottish Natural Heritage.The find of Multiclavula corynoides ndash sometimes referred to as Club-wielding Crust Lichen ndash was made by David Genney, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos lichen expert, while he was out mountainbiking around Ben Wyvis National Nature Reserve in the Highlands of Scotland.The lichen occurs across Scandinavia, in Iceland and in northern North America but this is the first record of the species in Britain.Most lichens are composed of a cup-fungus and an alga with distinctive circular jam-tart blooms, but this species is dferent because it forms tiny clubshaped ldquofruits which emerge from a mat of algae and fungal threads.It was discovered on the verge of a gravel forest road at the base of Ben Wyvis nature reserve, the slopes of which are home to a huge range of plants, mosses, liverworts and lichens.Mr Genney said: ldquoI was out with a couple of friends enjoying a dayrsquos mountain-biking around Ben Wyvis. While Irsquom usually focused on the trail ahead and wide mountain views I also keep half an eye out for interesting plants and fungi, especially on the long, slow uphill section.ldquoI suppose I was secretly hoping for an excuse for a rest so was delighted when I spotted something a little dferent out of the corner of my eye.The naturalist said he had been inspired to find rare lichens by a project run by Kew gardens in London that aims to seek out unusual and undocumented fungi across the UK.There are an estimated . million species of fungi worldwide ndash and possibly millions more ndash but, because of their often remote habitats, gaining information on their whereabouts can be hard.The Kew Gardens scheme is a five-yearlong effort calling on scientists and the public to rediscover lost species, to look for rare ieties, revisit sites known from historical records for a fresh look, and survey plausible locations for new populations.It was with this in mind that Mr Genney managed to spot the crop of Multiclavula corynoides, despite its remote location.He said: ldquoI recognised it because the Kew Lost and Found Fungi project have been encouraging citizen scientists to look out for rare or under-recorded species.ldquoThey had highlighted a related lichen as one of their target species so things like this were on my radar.ldquoItrsquos always exciting to find something yoursquove never seen but for it to be a species that has never been seen in Britain before made my day.ldquoThe discovery fills a gap in our knowledge of the global distribution of this little fungus. Itrsquos also interesting that it was thriving on an old forestry road siding, demonstrating how nature can sometimes benefit from man-made habitats.ldquoIt just shows the importance of keeping your eyes peeled when yoursquore out and about enjoying the outdoors ndash you never know what you might discover.The discovery may be down to next yearrsquos autumn delivering perfect conditions for fungi to bloom.A damp end to the summer and a wet autumn created fertile ground for them, with some species which usually haunt dark corners being seen in the open.Gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens and Partner Gardens have reported findings of unusual species, giant specimens and prolerations of ldquofairy rings made of red and white-spotted toadstools."},{"url":null,"title":"truly-wonderful-times-year","story":"But there was nothing mad about the hiring of Fiona Bruce to front Question Time.

Instead the earliest it could happen would be one to two years after the  Holyrood elections.On the mandate issue, while Nicola Sturgeon claims it is ldquounarguable, she is well aware of many potential arguments against it, not least because the latest General Election was primarily about Brexit. Equally, for many in Scotland the expectation that the result of the  referendum should stand for a reasonable period,not a generation, should not be overturned by a change in circumstancesopinion polling suggests those changes have not signicantly shted support for independence.As for whether leaving the UK would be more complex and painful than leaving the EU, no one observing the machinations of the last three years of negotiations can think it would be anything but far worse to disentangle from the much closer and deeply seated UK union.Finally, the First Minister will not want to publicly contemplate what she would dothe majority for independence in any future referendum was only slight. Would less than one per cent still be enough  Would a statistical draw be taken as justying separation  Mr Sturgeonrsquos sense of fairness would have her answer no to that, but the ingrained nationalist ambition for independence at any cost will see her avoid facing up to such a conundrum until it actually happens.Keith Howell, West Linton.THE four questions to Nicola Sturgeon in Mark Smithrsquos column go a long way to identying what doesnrsquot work with her approach to major constitutional issues in. As long as elections and referendums are based on first-past-the-post , the results will be what he describes rather too gently as ldquoan inaccurate reflection of opinion.The fundamental deficiency is that FPTP does not result in a spread of opinion in the so-called representatives which reflects the true wishes of the electorate as a whole. The votes of the PR-elected Scottish Parliament MSPs may seem more representative than FPTP, but bear in mind that  per cent of them are elected by FPTP in any case and the voters have no way of influencing the opinions or actions of the remaining list MSPs.It doesnrsquot need to be this way. There is already a clear majority in the Scottish Parliament for the Single Transferable Vote and one has to question why it has not already been enacted. Mr Smith might consider adding that to his questions. I hope he gets some answers, as I havenrsquot.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.STUART Waitonis right to highlight how elitism can be a downfall of a political party.

Could. Not. Compute.After the slew of early morning shoppers, it would be relatively calm as there wasnt an awful lot to come into the city for.New Years Day, too, would be eerie on the way into work as every other shop front was shuttered. By lunchtime we would be jam packed with stragglers who had come into the city centre for a look around only to find the place a ghost town. Mostly it was tourists, holiday makers who didnt realise the entire country was also on holiday.Now, in the city centre, youre spoiled for choice on New Years Day. No need to stay home when you can head into town.My memory might be playing tricks, but around that time, Im sure, Next was a one-off for its early opening hour, which was why the sale created such a legion of annual fans. Not so now.This year Matalan advertised am opening hours for some of its stores. Yesterday at the Intu Victoria Centre in Nottingham, shoppers queued from am, their Christmas dinners still halfway along their alimentary canals. Thats barely enough time to have digested the clfhanger from the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special before heading to the shops.Marks and Spencer got in ahead of the crowd by starting its online sale at pm on Christmas Day.And this is where the annual handwringing about gross consumerism begins but now we have an added tension - the environmental impact.Of course weve long known that consumerism has a negative environmental impact but this year it cant be ignored, Greta Thunberg has made sure of that.As Australian bushfires rage out of control, as children strike for climate action and as Donald Trump ties himself in knots over what wind is or isnt, we simply cant justy the unfettered desire for stuff that washes over us come Christmas time.Yet, as the planet is dying, so too is the high street.This year Scotland has seen some of the worst sales figures on record with store after store folding and hundreds of jobs being made redundant. Sales yesterday were expected to fall by . per cent on last year in real le shops, although online sales were expected to rise by  per cent.Boxing Day, for many retailers, remains the busiest in the calendar year and, against such bleak trading conditions, who can grudge them it Not everyone making the journey to the high street will be buying an entirely unnecessary set of hair straighteners to replace the nigh-on identical set of hair straighteners they bought last year. Not everyone will be buying their seventh pair of boyfriend jeans, each pair imperceptibly dferent from the last.Some people will be buying important household items that theyve waited all year to pick up, say. Or treating themselves to an item they otherwise couldnt afford. Something they might not \"need\" but that makes them feel better.Its not fair or reasonable to tar all frantic shoppers with one brush.As long as people are making justiable choices - without kidding themselves over what they want and what they need - then fine.For once we could perhaps look to Trump as a positive example. I mean, sort of. Grudgingly and at a push. Asked on Christmas Eve what hed bought for his we, the US President said he had only bought her a Christmas card. Im sure it was the most beautul and bigliest card ever but still, when you have everything you could possibly need, a card is enough.Hopefully Melania saw it the same way and wasnt expecting diamonds on Christmas morning. Still, Im quite sure shes used to being disappointed by her husband.Friends, this year for the first time, stepped back from gt buying. One of my friends doesnt want presents now she has children one feels we are too old for Christmas gts another feels the time of year is too stressful and so wanted to cut out the added pressure of buying presents.I love giving and receiving gts with friends because I feel its a way of showing thought and care. Yet I cant quibble with any of my now non-gting buying friends because, ultimately, I have everything I need and I fret over my environmental impact.Among the annual conversation about how much is too much, we often forget the other people at the heart of our consumer decisions - the retail staff who are giving up festive time with loved ones to facilitate our shopping habits.Of course, theres a flip side there too. Some will appreciate being able to earn double time, particularly at the most wonderfully expensive time of year. Others wont celebrate Christmas others might be lonely at the holiday season and enjoy being at work.Yet, do we really need to have retail staff on hand to serve us at am  We dont, of course not. Christmas is as much a time to relax, pause, take stock. We have whittled this down to one shop-free day, meaning retail workers have to sacrice this precious lull to folk can benefit from  per cent off a bath bomb.We must cut down on our spending habits.

understand.ldquoI started giving talks at sci-fi conventions, sharing my passion for the lsquoscience of science fictionrsquo.ldquoTherersquos a huge audience of people who have always loved science but never went into it, and who take any opportunity to learn more.ldquoLinking it to their favourite fandoms gives an anchor for references and makes it seem a little more accessible.ldquoI explain what can and canrsquot work in real science by exploring sci-fi devices such as travelling faster than the speed of light with a warp drive.ldquoAnd I use the Star Trek transporter to explain the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states we can never know the exact position and momentum of particles.ldquoThis rule makes a real-world transporter scientically impossible but the writers of

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So in , ,  you were getting six or seven, maybe  ndash so very low numbers of grey seal pups.ldquoThen slowly but surely they increased and then by the mid-noughties they were into the s.ldquoAnd then it jumped quite signicantly and by  we got  pups for the first time.

While the greys are thriving, another species ndash the common harbour seal ndash is struggling.It used to be the more prevalent species in the lough, with an estimated population of around  in the mid-s.But the common seal numbers were more than halved by a devastating distemper virus that swept through Europe around that time and the species has never really re-established itself in Strangford.This year the total population was below , with an average of - pups born annually. --A rookery of grey seals hauled out on one of Strangfordrsquos uninhabited mid lough islands--Mr Thurgate counts himself as very fortunate to have the job of monitoring the Strangford seals.He said: ldquoIf you like the outdoor le itrsquos a fantastic job and I know Irsquom very lucky.ldquoIf you look at my job description therersquos lots of people who would like my job, but Irsquoll hang on to it for the time being.The grey seal baby boom is recorded in the National Trustrsquos review of  for Northern Ireland ndash a year that saw several other types of wildle thrive in Strangford Lough and the Ards Peninsula.Populations of terns, brent geese and otters also showed an increase. --Seal numbers reach a peak in Strangford during the autumn breeding season--On dry land it was another good year for the resurgent red squirrels, whose population is now up to around  as a result of efforts by conservationists to keep the dominate greys out of the peninsula.Warm spells of weather in the early half of the year saw migrant species of butterflies set course for Northern Ireland, with signicant numbers of Painted Lady butterflies arriving en masse for the first time in a decade.This was mirrored by a drop in sightings of native species, such as the common white, which are struggling as a consequence of intensive land use, habitat fragmentation and climate change.copy -.

The am service is regarded as an official engagement with attendance approved by the Queen and attracts hundreds of spectators.However, he did attend the am private service earlier in the morning with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family, and was seen walking alongside Price Charles.Following the interview with Maitlis, the duke has withdrawn or been dropped as patron from more than  charities, including English National Ballet and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, following the negative publicity after the interview.He was also ditched as chancellor of the University of Huddersfield after students said he was unfit for the role due to his “association with a known paedophile”.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit. It was well under way, long before Brexit. So back to my original point.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sees record 900000 applying for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An Eir spokesman said  payphones have been removed so far this year with requests from council and continued anti-social behaviour cited as the most common reason for removal.There were on average  calls per day in September  equating to on average . call from each payphone daily.Eir saida payphone is used for less than one minute a day on average andemergency services calls do not count for more than  seconds of each minute, it can remove it.The company is set to replace old payphones around Dublin with upgraded versions that will include Wi-Fi, interactive touchscreens and information services for tourists.Eir applied for planning permission earlier this year to upgrade the kiosks in more than  locations around the city.In a statement, Eir said it has agreed a programme with Dublin City Council to improve public payphones at selected locations in Dublin, subject to planning approval.“The proposed structures are open stand-alone kiosks designed to reduce instances of anti-social behaviour, improve street furniture and provide enhanced services to users including interactive, digital information points.”Dublin City Council said a decision due date on Eir’s application is January , .“Twenty plus planning applications have been submitted to Dublin City Council for the replacement of existing telephone kiosks with new telephone kiosks.”“Each kiosk will have an integral communication unit and a . square metre digital advertising display.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

drinking habit of eight pints of beer and one bottle of wine per couple per week, bought from a bar or pub.It was calculated that a self-imposed drinking ban could boost the financial health of a couple by as much as £ per week typically – although pub and bar prices can y hugely.The research involved searching ious travel websites earlier in December to see how far a couple’s weekly savings could take them.It found that, for a couple, giving up alcohol for:– Five weeks could bag a two-night stay in Amsterdam including flights, costing £– Seven weeks could result in a three-night stay in Prague at £–  weeks could pay for a five-night stay in the Algarveat £–  weeks could fund a £ trip to Naples for seven nights–  weeks could save enough for a £, all-inclusive seven-night holiday at

.Alana Parsons, chief operating officer at Caxton, said: “Many of us enjoy a drink either to wind down in the evening or while out with friends or family at weekends, but we rarely tally up how much it costs us over the course of a year.“With the party season nearly behind us, thoughts naturally turn to making plans for the year ahead.“Extending the traditional dry January for a further few months or longer might not work for everyone, but a New Year Resolution that’s good for your health as well as your pocket is easier to stick toyou have a holiday on the horizon.“Planning your  travel itinerary nice and early helps you bag the best holiday deals – but while you’re at it, don’t forget to checkyour passports are still in date and that you’ve got your holiday currency, pre-paid

bpanews_feb-ea-f-d-aabb_EmailChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study..pushScientists have found that listening to music prompts the primates to perform rhythmic movements such as swaying, hand-clapping and foot-tapping.The researchers say that understanding more about the predisposition of these great apes to music could shed light on how humans came to appreciate melodies.Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga, of Kyoto University in Japan, studied seven chimpanzees who were exposed to six two-minute piano compositions for six days.They found that while the music was being played, the chimps swayed their bodies and bobbed their heads and, sometimes, went as far as clapping their hands and tapping their feet.The team also found that male chimpanzees were more likely to respond to the tunes by being more vocal and swaying rhythmically for longer durations compared with their female counterparts.In their paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers noted: “Given that humans do not have such a sex dference in musical ability, higher sensitivity to sound in male chimpanzees may have been acquired after chimpanzees erged from the common ancestor shared with humans.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A male chimpanzee making a rhythmic display at the enclosure in the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University “This may also be associated with their patriarchal society, where male chimpanzees often collaborate to protect their territory and group members.”To understand more about their musical inclination, the researchers selected the chimpanzee most responsive to the music.They then exposed the animal, called Akira, to additional musical sessions, with four two-minute experiences for  days.The researchers found that both random and regular beats induced rhythmic swaying in Akira.The movements were more pronounced when Akira was standing on two feet rather than on all fours, which the researchers believe could be down to the chimpanzee having a greater flexibility in the bipedal posture.In addition, Akira also stayed longer in the area where music was playing, indicating that the chimpanzee actively sought musical stimulation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The chimpanzee enclosure at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University According to the authors, the findings point to a foundation for dancing in a common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.The team wrote in the paper: “In humans, listening to music induces rhythmic movement, suggesting a close connection between the auditory and motor areas in the brain.“These results suggest that prerequisites for music and dance are deeply rooted and existed in the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, approximately six million years ago.”Meanwhile, in a separate study also published in Pnas, scientists have found that chimpanzees share tools with each other and teach their fellow beings new skills so they are able to perform complex and challenging food-hunting tasks.Researchers in the US say that this act of sharing tools and skills in chimpanzees is similar to that seen in humans."},{"url":null,"title":"monkeys enjoy specially baked mince pies ahead of christmas at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

The new league structure saw them test themselves against a handful of intermediate sides which set them up for a tilt at a championship. In truth they never looked tested until Drums comeback in the final but Glacks greater fitness levels saw them push on. Drum had a dficult season but after coming close to folding, they dusted themselves down for a rattle at the championship.They found the going tough against Sean Dolans and almost came a cropper against Doire Colmcille but they deserve a lot of credit for getting themselves back to the force they once were. googletag.cmd.push  - JM McLaughlinThe OConnors didnt concede a championship goal until the final. A huge part of that was the stability they gained from James Martin McLaughlins presence behind his defence. He gave them confidence, kicked with conviction, his handling was impeccable and he could do little to stop Rory OReillys goal in the decider.[st All-Star]  - Seamus OKaneOKane was more than the average corner-back. He was tigerish in the tackle and in the final, despite giving away height to Aaron Moore, he limited the Glack mans influence. On top of that, he scored - in four games, including four points - including two in the closing minutes - to save them from a shock defeat against Doire Colmcille.[st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Ryan OKaneWas very much the fixer in Glacks defence. The number on his jersey was irrelevant. He was tasked with blotting out danger. In the semi-final, he won two vital possessions intended for their danger-man Patrick Feeney.In the final, he picked up Niall Ferris and kept him quiet until the Drum man went on a roving role to save the game.[st All-Star]  - Jimmy OConnorJimmy picked up his first award in  and continues to deliver.Glacks play anywhere player was key to all that they were about. A superb block to deny Gary Fisher in their win over Dolans demonstrated his defence nuance but his first-half display in the final was out of the top drawer. His engine allowed him to get forward to kick two points and he played a central part in Cormac Boyles point. [th All-Star]  - Niall FerrisAfter picking up a hurling award, he is selected for the fourth time in the football number five jersey. He missed the opening game with Dolans but landed three points in their great escape against Doire Colmcille. His use of the ball in the middle third was a hallmark of Drums semi-final win over Magilligan. Wasnt effective in the final until he pulled deep to help his sides comeback.[th All-Star]  - Niall BurkeA first selection since  for the Drum defender.In the semi-final win over Magilligan, he had the courage to spray passes from defence in dficult conditions. When Drum were struggling for scores early in the final, he passed to Kevin OReilly for a point. In the second-half his work-rate dragged Drum back into contention.[rd All-Star]  - Ryan MorganIts Morgies fourth selection but a first in a defensive slot.Glacks new management team deployed him at wing back and it gave them an extra attacking dimension.Missed the early rounds of the championship but he was the key to unlocking Moneymore early on. In the final, he scored twice but was the springboard for Glacks counter-attack, linking well with Jimmy OConnor.[th All-Star]  - Martin McGonigleAfter being selected as a minor in  All-Star line-up, he is now the heartbeat of Glacks midfield.The former county minor players endless running saw him destroy both Doire Colmcille in the first round and Moneymore in the semi-final.Enjoyed a tough battle with Shane Millar in the final but still got forward to play a part in two Glack scores. ~[nd All-Star]  - Eddie McLaughlinThe long-serving midfielder just edges out his colleague Ciaran Carmichael for the spot.Listed at midfield but his defensive instincts saw him drt between centre-back and the important holding role, with McGonigle bombing forward.It was his defence-splitting pass that set-up Niall McGowans killer goal to put Glack  points clear in the final. [nd All-Star]  -Cormac BoyleIn a new role this season, Boyle played much of the season as a ball-winner at wing-forward, where he worked unselfishly for the team.He chipped in with -, including a point to cap a man of the match performance in the final, when he dominated kick-outs.His absence was felt when injury ruled him out of the Rock game.[nd All-Star]  - Niall McGowan -JUNIOR PLAYER OF THE YEARMcGoo scored - across Glacks club championship games, led by example and was the fulcrum of their devastating attacking game.He played between full-forward and as a link man as the OConnors eased their way to the a first title since .In the final he finished his goal with precision and kicked a wonder point from a sideline to cap it all off.[rd All-Star]  - Collie MullanHe started the championship at corner-back against Moneymore and one of his passes from defence put Magilligan through for their opening point.It was when Leo Sweeney moved him into attack that he began to blossom. After scoring - against Ardmore, he gave Drum plenty to think about in the semi-final and had what looked to be a late point ruled out with the game in the melting pot.[st All-Star]  - Odhraacuten McKaneOne of the most exciting players in this years campaign was the Dolans inside forward.He tortured Drum in the first-half, scoring every time he got on the ball. The following week, he scored - against eventual winners Glack.His athleticism and accuracy made him a match for anyone.[st All-Star]  - Kevin OReillyA second award after being named at full-back in the  selection.He landed - as Drum progressed to the final and his long ball almost opened the door for a James McCartney goal against Magilligan in the semi-final. But it was his awareness and use of the ball that made him invaluable. His six points against Doire Colmcille were invaluable and in the final he pulled deep late on, trying to engineer a comeback.[nd All-Star]  - Patrick FeeneyIn what was a testing season for Moneymore, Feeney was the ray of light in their attack.With blistering pace and ied runs, he totted up a score of -as Moneymore qualied for the semi-finals.He found the going tougher as Glack shut out the supply but he still managed to get on the score-sheet[nd All-Star]    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The feast of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, is marked on  December and in Ireland is often referred to as Laacute Fheacuteile Stiofaacutein or Laacute an Dreoiliacuten or Wren Day. Traditionally, this is also a popular day for visiting family members and going to the theatre to see a pantomimeThe name alludes to several legends including ones found in Irish mythology that link the le of Jesus to the wren bird. In a fading tradition in all but a few parts of Ireland, people dress up in old clothes and straw garments and travel from door to door carrying fake wrens during which those taking part sing, dance and play music.Dependent on which region of Ireland you are in those taking part are called either “wrenboys” or mummers. Mummers carry on the tradition at the village of New Inn, Co Galway and Dingle, Co Kerry. In the North, the tradition is still often observed in Co Fermanagh. The tradition has its roots in ancient Ireland when a real wren was killed and carried around in a holly bush tied to a long pole - these days fake birds are used. The wren is one of the smallest birds in Ireland, but it has a very loud song and is sometimes called the “king of all birds.” This is because of the legend of a little wren who rode on the top of an eagles head and boasted he had “flown higher than an eagle.” Wrens were hunted for many years throughout Europe in medieval times with Ireland no exception to that. In most parts of the island, the tradition died out in the early th century and the rhyme often used during the procession was “The wren, the wren, the king of all birds. On St. Stephens Day was caught in the furze. Although he was little his honor was great. Jump up me, lads, and give us a treat.”In past times, the captured wren was tied to the wrenboy leaders staff or a net would be put on a pitchfork. It would be sometimes cruelly kept alive, as the popular mummers parade song states A penny or tuppence would do it no harm.” The song, of which there are many iations, asked for donations from the townspeople. One iation sung in Edmondstown, County Dublin ran as such: If you havent a penny a halfpenny will do. If you havent a halfpenny, God bless you!”Often the boys gave a feather from the bird to patrons for good luck. The money was used to host a dance or Wren Ball for the town on a night in January. googletag.cmd.push  St Stephen, the first Christian martyr was stoned to death in Jerusalem in Ad . Wrenboys would go from house to house in the countryside collecting money but in the towns the groups were more organised and there was often an element of faction-fighting. In both cases there would be a Wren Captain, usually wearing a cape and carrying a sword, musicians, strawboys and others dressed as old women or other things. It is a day of wild revelry and people usually conceal their identities so they can play tricks on their friends. This type of behaviour is typical of Celtic festivals as a sort of purge. The band of young boys has expanded to include girls, and adults often join in. The money collected from the townspeople is now usually donated to a school or charity.The wren celebration may have descended from Celtic mythology. Ultimately, the origin may be a Samhain or midwinter sacrice or celebration, as Celtic mythology considered the wren a symbol of the past year. The European wren is known for its habit of singing even in mid-winter, and its name in the Netherlands, winter king, reflects this. Celtic names of the wren- draouennig, drean, dreathan also suggest an association with druidic rituals.In the Welsh version of the myth, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, a Celtic hero, wins his name by hitting or killing a wren. He strikes a wren between the tendon and the bone of its leg, causing Arianrhod, his mother, to say it is with a skillful hand that the fair-haired one has hit it. At that Gwydion, his foster father, reveals himself, saying Lleu Llaw Gyffes the fair-haired one with the skillful hand is his name now.And, in the Isle of Man, the hunting of the wren is associated with an ancient enchantress or queen of the fairiesnamed Tehi Tegi which translates to something like beautul gatherer in Brythonic. The Manx spoke Brythonic before they switched to Gaelic. Tehi Tegi was so beautul that all the men of the Island followed her around in hope of marrying her, and neglected their homes and fields. Tehi Tegi led her suitors to the river and then drowned them. She was confronted, but turned into a wren and escaped. She was banished from the Island but s once a year, when she is hunted.The myth most commonly told in Ireland to explain the festival is that God wished to know who was the king of all birds so he set a challenge. The bird who flew highest and furthest would win. The birds all began together but they dropped out one by one until none were left but the great eagle. The eagle eventually grew tired and began to drop lower in the sky. At this point, the treacherous wren emerged from beneath the eagles wing to soar higher and further than all the others.The tradition may also have been influenced by Scandinavian settlers during the Viking invasions of the th to th centuries though it is usually attributed to the Christianising of old pagan festivals by saints to ease the transition and promote conversion. googletag.cmd.push  A depiction of the wrenboys taking part in the St Stephen’s Day procession. Various associated legends exist, such as a wren being responsible for betraying Irish soldiers who fought the Viking invaders by beating its wings on their shields.In , Liam Clancy recorded The Wran Song , which was sung in Ireland by wrenboys. In  Steeleye Span recorded The King on Please to See the King, which also reflects the tradition. They made another version, The Cutty Wren, on their album Time. Hunting the Wren is on John Kirkpatricks album Wassail! The Chieftains made a collection of wrenboy tunes on The Bells of Dublin. In the song, The Boys of Barr na Sraacuteide, which is based on a poem by Sigerson Clford, the wren hunt is also prominent.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In October I was part of a campaign in support of the International Day of Older Persons, and the tea dances are a brilliant way to tie into that because it gets everyone up and about, chatting, enjoying themselves, and having a few dances.

And we visited all the local shops and businesses on Central Drive with gts to say thank you for everything they have done for us. Its great for the childrens confidence to go out into the community and we always get people phoning us to praise their great behaviour.The school also raised pound, for St Vincent de Paul through the school raffle, which will help local families in need.-- googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks.Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the “New World” and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.”This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.”The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. It is a matter of historical record that Englands King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after the Second World War that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day.An English farmer, Thomas Tusser. noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey, appeared as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That, of course, came in  when Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew.According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year – nine million of those for the Christmas season alone. However, that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the US, three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day.In Norway, for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway, they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany, the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile, in Jamaica Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a traditional Argentinean Christmas dinner you’ll most probably find turroacuten at dessert. Turroacuten, also known as nougat, is typically made of sugar, honey and egg white, with toasted almonds or other nuts. It comes in dferent shapes, such as a rectangular tablet or a round cake. googletag.cmd.push   - Australia  It might be hot in Australia at Christmas time, but Australians still have a White Christmas. This is the name of their traditional Christmas dessert. It’s basically a mixture of raisins, cherries, dried coconut, icing sugar, milk powder and rice bubbles, with hydrogenated coconut oil as the ingredient that puts all the rest together. White Christmas is usually served cut into squares and because it’s very easy to make even children give it a try in the holiday season.  - Belgium  Belgians bake cougnou or bread of Jesus during Christmas time. This sweet bread is formed like a baby Jesus and is decorated with dferent elements such as flowers, circles etc. The composition includes flour, eggs, milk, yeast, raisins, sugar and is usually enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate. googletag.cmd.push  - Brazil  One of the most popular Brazilian desserts is pudim de leite condensado or condensed milk pudding, containing condensed milk , regular milk, eggs and caramelized sugar on top. Whether it’s Christmas or other festive occasions, Brazilians take every opportunity to serve this custard dessert.  - Canada  The Yule log, a dessert shaped to resemble a miniature log or a chopped off tree branch, is a form of sweet roulade made of sponge cake. It is traditionally prepared for Christmas in other countries as well for example, in France it’s known as bucircche de Noeumll. The original Yule log recipe dates back in the th century and has developed many iations along the way. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate butter cream.   - France  In France, it is customary to serve  desserts at the Christmas table. Les treize desserts de Noeumllrepresent Jesus Christ and the  apostles and they include walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, apples, pears, green melon, black and white raisins, figs oranges and mandarins. The desserts are traditionally set out on Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days, until December .  - Iceland  Iceland’s Laufabrauethconsists of a round, very thin flat cake with a diameter of about  to  cm , decorated with leaf-like, geometric patterns and fried briefly in hot fat or oil. Baking this leaf bread is an important part of the Christmas preparations in every home in Iceland.  - India  A popular Christmas cake served by the Christian population of Hindustan in India is the allahabadi, a rum fruit cake originating and lending its name from the Northern Indian city of Allahabad. It’s made with maida flour, eggs, claried butter, sugar, petha - a translucent soft candy from North India, marmalade, nuts, ginger and fennel as its main ingredients.  - Italy  The cupola-shaped sweet bread called panettone is originally from Milan and it became an omnipresent dessert on Italians’ Christmas Eve dinner. The process of properly preparing the panettone in order to obtain its distinctive fluffy characteristics takes several days. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as dried raisins. It is served in slices, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone or crema di zabaione.  - Japan  Even though Christmas is not a national holiday in Japan - with only about  percent of Japan’s population being Christian - the Japanese do have a Christmas cake. The dessert is a type of sponge cake, covered with snow-white whipped cream and topped with red strawberries. The red and white in this cake reminds of the Japanese flag colors and this is probably why the cake became so popular in Japan that it even has its own emoji. The Japanese Christmas cake is a perfect example of Western traditions being adopted by the Japanese culture and given a dferent and fresh meaning.  - Mexico  Hot beverages are almost as popular as baked desserts at Christmas time. In Mexico, the drink that accompanies the festive meal is atole, which includes masa , water, piloncillo , cinnamon, vanilla and optional chocolate or fruit. Atole ies in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin liquid consistency. Instead of masa as a main ingredient, rice, flour, or oatmeal can be used.  - Norway  The most commonly eaten Christmas cookie in all of Norway is pepperkake - translated as pepper cake. It’s a ginger bread cookie spiced with black pepper and formed into a heart or other shape. Pepperkake is complemented with coffee, tea or especially gloslashgg, a spiced drink served warm, with or without alcohol.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather and tidal surges, high spring tides, the pups aren’t capable of thermo-regulating properly when they are young and you get high pup fatalities because of weather.“Soyou’ve got calmer conditions it’s going to give your pups a better chance of survival.”The mid lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out, with large groups, known as rookeries, now a regular sight for boat users who know where to look.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford for two decades, has seen the population grow from a low base.Special visitors to Warwick Hospital helped to raise funds for childrens AE waiting area and two wardsLeo Varadkar: No justication for united Ireland poll at moment Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said: “In the early s, you would have been lucky to get six or seven pups.“We started counting seals in . So in , ,  you were getting six or seven, maybe  – so very low numbers of grey seal pups.“Then slowly but surely they increased and then by the mid-noughties they were into the s.“And then it jumped quite signicantly and by  we got  pups for the first time. And then in  they went past  – there were  that year.“So they went from just over  to  pretty rapidly, and this year was an all-time high at .”But it is not all good news for Strangford seals. While the greys are thriving, another species – the common harbour seal – is struggling.It used to be the more prevalent species in the lough, with an estimated population of around  in the mid-s.But the common seal numbers were more than halved by a devastating distemper virus that swept through Europe around that time and the species has never really re-established itself in Strangford.This year the total population was below , with an average of - pups born annually.Mr Thurgate counts himself as very fortunate to have the job of monitoring the Strangford seals.He said: “If you like the outdoor le it’s a fantastic job and I know I’m very lucky.“If you look at my job description there’s lots of people who would like my job, but I’ll hang on to it for the time being.”The grey seal baby boom is recorded in the National Trust’s review of  for Northern Ireland – a year that saw several other types of wildle thrive in Strangford Lough and the Ards Peninsula.Populations of terns, brent geese and otters also showed an increase.On dry land it was another good year for the resurgent red squirrels, whose population is now up to around  as a result of efforts by conservationists to keep the dominate greys out of the peninsula.Warm spells of weather in the early half of the year saw migrant species of butterflies set course for Northern Ireland, with signicant numbers of Painted Lady butterflies arriving en masse for the first time in a decade.This was mirrored by a drop in sightings of native species, such as the common white, which are struggling as a consequence of intensive land use, habitat fragmentation and climate change.try catch  TrendingNI road remains closed this morning after man dies in serious road traffic collision -

I don’t see that we would gain from that sort of scenario.”He said recent elections had shown a change in political sentiment amongst the electorate.“If you look at the results of the recent Westminster elections in Ireland and you take them with European elections, local elections, the Assembly elections, then you do see that there has been a change,” he said.“For the first time since the foundation of Northern Ireland, unionist parties do not have a majority.“They definitely don’t, it was not a one-off, it is four elections now of dferent sorts.”He said political leaders needed to rededicate themselves to the  Good Friday Agreement, power-sharing in Northern Ireland and North South cooperation.He noted the signicance of the surge in representation of non-sectarian parties such as the cross-community Alliance Party in the recent election.Special visitors to Warwick Hospital helped to raise funds for childrens AE waiting area and two wards Coremetrics  Coremetrics

taoiseach said: “When we have the institutions up and running properly then there is time to have a long look at the institutional arrangements and the constitutional arrangements.“We have to learn from our history and we have to understand that there are a million people on this island who are British and are unionists so we need to respect that and make sure that they are part of the future

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

There looks to be a change around mid-month to milder conditions, although the timing is very uncertain.\"This change looks likely to bring milder and wetter conditions across most parts of the UK, allowing temperatures to recover to around average, or perhaps slightly above.\"The wettest conditions are likely to be in the north and west, with an increased likelihood of drier spells in the south and southeast.\"Colder interludes are still possible.\"There have only been four occasion in the UK in the last  years where more than  per cent of stations in the UK reported snow on the ground at am.After -cm of snow fell in the Highlands and mph winds occurred on the Welsh Coast a few weeks ago, bookmakers started offering odds on snowfall in a number of cities across the UK.However, betting odds have now changed, suggesting snow is less likely to fall in the UK this Christmas.A spokesman for William Hill said: \"At this stage of the year, the odds always suggest that a White Christmas is a long shot.\"Its - against snow in Aberdeen on Christmas Day, - against snow in Glasgow, - against snow in Edinburgh, and - snow in Newcastle.London is -.According to long range weather forecaster Exacta Weather, there could be blizzards on Christmas Day followed by a freezing cold January. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonSuspected illegal drugs found at gates of NI nursery schoolNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
