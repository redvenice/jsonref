It was absolutely disgusting.\u0027He has a nice car with a private number plate. He\u0027s obviously got a few quid so he could afford them. But he was just a really arrogant person. He didn\u0027t care.\u0027I looked on the way to his car and the glove dispensary was empty. The next person filling up had no way of protecting themselves from this virus.\u0027I opened his car door to confront him about it. I gave him every opportunity to put them back.\u0027I told him he\u0027d taken each and every one of those gloves that people need to stop spreading this virus. He had them all there on your front seat.\u0027He wasn\u0027t bothered. He just looked at me. In the end he said \u0027do you want some\u0027?\u0027I wasn\u0027t sure if he meant did I want some of the gloves or did I want a fight. I wasn\u0027t sure of the actual context.\u0027Then he just shut the door and drove off.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe he didn\u0027t put them back when confronted. In these times, the way things are, we need every little help with hygiene.\u0027 Steve, who had been to buy some bread, milk and eggs with his partner Carol Cooper, 51, suffers with asthma and had been practising social distancing before confronting the Mercedes driver. \u0027Tesco put those gloves out there for everyone for a reason and he thought it was his right to take them all. It was disgusting.\u0027I only put one glove on to save wasting them. He had used one and when he\u0027d finished he binned that and then walked back to the dispensary and grabbed the whole lot.\u0027He took them all and put them in his car. \u0027There are a lot of people with underlying health problems that you don\u0027t know about so you have to think of everybody else.\u0027Being selfish is not the way to do it.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m very sorry\u0027: Mercedes driver filmed taking all the rubber gloves from petrol pump apologises for being \u0027selfish and irresponsible\u0027 - Manchester Evening News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ac6dedb0afbde28f03dc6c455869aea83ad7aa/0_263_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6ab4bf3c5869c9b29a712a7b7dc95a","title":"italys delivery drivers on lockdown photo essay","story":"In quarantine in Italy, Filippo Venturi turned his camera on the people providing a vital lifeline outside his front doorOn a locked-down Saturday night, Filippo Venturi came down the stairs of his apartment block in Forlì, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, to collect his pizza delivery. But before the rider left, he asked something they probably weren’t expecting: “Can I take your picture?”Venturi, 39, began studying photography 11 years ago, and has since documented sport, theatre events and social phenomena. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, he has been photographing delivery riders. Speaking down the phone from his home, where he, his partner and their son have been quarantined for two weeks, he tells me how he started to worry about the riders, coming into contact with stranger after stranger, while providing an essential service to those who can afford to self-isolate. As he started ordering more deliveries, he asked each rider – from a safe distance – about their lives under coronavirus.Most told him they weren’t worried, because they take precautions, as do customers. But 23-year-old Andrea, delivering sushi, wasn’t so sure. “I’m not calm,” he told Venturi. “Even if I take all the precautions, people tend to touch you, to take risks – they assume neither of you are infected. But I could be, or they could be. How do I know that they’re not in quarantine?”Venturi tells me he was struck by both the lack of consideration given to riders’ health, and their lack of choice when it came to doing the job. Davide, 25, was laid off when the restaurant he worked for closed down his second job as a personal trainer has also been terminated. Delivering burgers to make ends meet, Davide hasn’t been given a mask or gloves. “If they want them, they have to buy them themselves,” Venturi says. “Before the crisis, they cost one or two euros each – now they cost €20 or €30. And it’s not as if they can wear them for days and days.”Naturally, the lockdown made some interviews difficult. While most people were happy to talk, Venturi says, a driver called Antonio would only tell him, “I work in black.” Why? “I think it was his way of explaining that he couldn’t tell me anything else. The police roam the streets, making sure anyone who is out has a valid reason. I think he was worried that being photographed and interviewed wasn’t a good enough reason.” Delivery riders have witnessed the multiple ways people deal with their anxieties about contagion.Simone, 32, brought Venturi breakfast from a nearby coffee bar. The venue had always delivered pizza in the evening, but expanded their hours to deliver from 9am to 10pm. He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. “Perhaps that’s a little excessive,” Venturi says, “but taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.” Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he’s not very worried. His main fear is that the situation could get worse. “I fear that the government might also consider stopping home deliveries,” he says.An unexpected upside was shared by 19-year-old Lucian. Generally, people do not tip in Italy now, in an effort to avoid touching notes and coins, customers are telling him to keep the change.“So he’s making more money, and that’s better for him, but the reason is sad,” Venturi says. “They’re not being generous – they’re afraid of him.”At the time of writing, the mortality rate for Covid-19 in Italy is the highest in the world, in part because the population is older. But Venturi is concerned that many younger people don’t seem to grasp that they, too, are potentially at risk.Alessandro, 21, told Venturi: “I’m calm when I work. I’m more worried about my band. We have an album coming out and we’re supposed to do a European tour in the late summer. I worry that everything will be cancelled.”The photographer says a lot of older people are frustratingly complacent, too: “They often think they’re safe if they don’t have cardiac or respiratory problems.”Though the job lacks the hero status afforded health workers and firefighters, Venturi points out that delivery riders have also risked their health so that others can stay safe and fed. Their lives might be tough or precarious in normal circumstances currently, they are even more so. “They bring food to people who are staying safe in their homes, but that puts them at greater risk. And they in turn risk taking it home and passing it on to family.” Why shouldn’t they keep the change?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d715560991e08d89ec2fbe7bee22f3a7c148b9cd/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb4c6d29f975145b8fb500815ffe142f 1010w","title":"for one tide only modernist sandcastles in pictures","story":"Artist Calvin Seibert grew up on a ski resort strongly influenced by brutalist architecture in 1960s Colorado. “The construction sites were never fenced in, so they were great places to play and always had piles of sand,” he says.

Downing Street approves most of the others and after it rejected Beard, the board appointed her itself.The Cambridge don, who will take up the role for an initial period of four years on Monday, said she was delighted. “It was a visit to the BM which first inspired me to work on the ancient world,” she told the Observer. “I have been a huge beneficiary of this and other museums in the country over the past 60 years, and am now delighted to be able to give something back.”After the Observer revealed at the beginning of March that she had been snubbed by Downing Street, thousands of readers called the decision petty and vindictive and said her expertise in ancient civilisations made her an ideal candidateA Downing Street source told the PA news agency that “the current administration is delighted to see Mary Beard appointed and has no reservations over her appointment, which should have happened sooner”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af309cb10ded5feb67c081d927be119950d9a09/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0777ef54774db8bd1f52e1c447f6aa8e","title":"lockdown diary extremely vulnerable home 12 weeks","story":"In this coronavirus crisis I’ve been made a Shielded Person of Significance.

Yesterday social media was full of posts that began “I’m no epidemiologist … ” followed by some amateur’s log-lined horrorvision. Today there are substantially more that begin “I am an epidemiologist … ” followed by threaded, detailed forecasts. These are much worse, and require no emoji intensifiers.I feel seen by Covid-19.

God damn you all to hell!FEELS LIKE SUNDAY? We live in a live-action version of Wallace and Gromit reality – a terraced house in the middle of a northern street. It quickly sorts itself into who’s up for fetching anything and who needs anything fetching. Harry Next Door – artificial hips, an anthology of ills and pills – is philosophical, humming The Streets of Laredo. “If you die,” he says cheerfully, over the hedge, “you die.” The ultimate social distancing strategy.Facsimiles of “people” appear in the news – hoarding carpetbaggers overseeing, as usual, the orderly transfer of wealth from us to them.

Will there be a Reckoning after all this? Perhaps we’ll choose to hang on to this rickety emergency socialism and exact revenge. Branson Green Ashley Martin \u0026amp Associates, stripped to their pants in a televised show trial. No. We are better than this. I have some much more imaginative suggestions, which I’ll keep to myself for now.Meanwhile, Juliet Across The Alley brings us a bag of shopping from the Bosch hellscape that was formerly our local supermarket. Fruit, veg, a fancy loaf. Unpacking it feels like Christmas morning, but much more emotional. Our son’s best friend at school, whom we haven’t seen in years, keeps leaving stuff on our step. As always when it counts, actual people are lovely. Humanity is beautiful. Why do we relentlessly ignore this? Humanity is an idiot.SATURDAY. We have four grandchildren. Two in South Korea and two just 10 minutes’ drive away. We have to Skype them all now. The K-Fam have been virtually confined to their apartment for months.

Here are their responsesThis week we asked arts workers to share how their livelihoods were being affected by the coronavirus. Since then, the UK government’s measures to give financial aid to the self-employed will help the sector – but many are still deeply concerned about the lack of work available in the coming months. Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch.Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writerMy play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March – a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success – four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I’d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming – a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for – all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears – just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn’t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I’m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level – I don’t and I haven’t. I’ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don’t know when I’ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.Michael Heggett, 59, lighting engineerMy entire work calendar for 2020 went away in the three days from 16 March. I lost the Pet Shop Boys world tour and the Olympic Games, which amounts to nine months of solid work and around £60,000 gross turnover. I have no other work on my books until November, which is a UK tour with Tim Minchin – if it goes ahead. As venues are closed and also gatherings of people banned and film sets closed, I will not be able to earn a living for the foreseeable time. My business and livelihood are completely destroyed.Matthew Reed, 40, comedianI had a full diary of gigs, a full summer of festivals and various clubs around the country, then overnight nothing, wiping out every penny for the foreseeable. My agents, Getcomedy, have been brilliant, but there’s no work, so they, too, are in a terrible situation. I’m a compere and in demand – I play every major club on the circuit and have done for years. So to go from every weekend full and plenty of midweek gigs to zero has been terrifying. The fragility of my situation has y crept up on me, and it’s also shown how little people really care. At a comedy night, if you do well you’re told: “Well done”, back slapped, thanked for a good night. “Couldn’t do what you do mate. It takes balls.” Now my entire income has gone I’ve been told, “Well, you’re just a comedian!” and, “Get a proper job.” I’ve had “proper” jobs – I’ve worked very hard to be where I am and comedy is a job. I’ve travelled miles for 20-minute sets, and the pay has been the same since I started – our wages haven’t gone up with inflation. People assume we are on a fortune, which just isn’t true. I absolutely love being a comedian, and this has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me professionally. But apparently it’s not as valid as an office worker losing their “proper job”.Anonymous, actor for 37 yearsAfter a good five months in theatre and television and feeling as if I was turning a corner after a difficult period, I found the rug pulled from under my feet. Future work cancelled. Income owed not likely to be received. No hope of working in my career for many, many months to come. I am already writing this year off. My industry has been decimated and the aftermath will be catastrophic. I do not know how I will survive this with no savings behind me. I love my job, but I feel totally broken and my mental health is very, very fragile.Denise Francis, 55, director of theatre education company Firehorse ProductionsI had three actors on contract for a five-week tour in June and July – this has now been cancelled, as schools are shut. There may be a slight chance we can scramble a three-week tour for November, but it is the two autumn tours that sustain us throughout the year, and not being able to produce them jeopardises the future of Firehorse. Two years ago, I also established the charity Afan Arts, giving the opportunity to pupils from surrounding schools to work alongside professional actors and film crews. Our third project Same But Different, two years in the planning, was due to begin at the end of July, but this has had to be cancelled. The year 11 pupils were devastated, another thing they have missed out on. We invest in our actors, love to see them grow and flourish – now we will not see that this year. It has been like watching your world crumble.Anonymous, 37, actorOn 16 March, a couple of hours before our cast were due on stage, we were told our show was cancelled that evening with immediate effect. Since then, it has become apparent that the production will not reopen anytime soon, and as yet we have no clarity on whether we will continue to be paid. My biggest fear is that our producer may be forced to use the force majeure clause in our contracts, allowing them to terminate our employment with immediate effect. Were that to happen, I would be left £40,000 out of pocket, that figure representing what I would have earned during the remainder of the show’s run.Colette Meacher, writer, editor and lecturerI’ve had mild symptoms of Covid-19, but as I effectively work on zero-hours contracts I’m not eligible for statutory sick pay. And, as it’s now the Easter break, my teaching hours are finished and my freelance editing and writing work has dried up, meaning that I don’t have a single commission or job on my desk. I’m stressed, sick and skint – but I’d still be working if I could as I urgently and desperately need some money for the mortgage, bills and, heck, even just to be able to go out and buy some food. It’s been nearly four weeks since I last got paid, and that was a grand total of £600 – pretty good by most months’ standards.Mike Nichamin, 56, live audio systems engineerAll touring is off as venues have closed and large gatherings banned. I was on tour in Europe at the time with the show An Evening with Whitney Houston, a hologram tour. I have now applied to Tesco as a delivery driver for £9 an hour, which won’t even cover my expenses.Bethany, 20, dancerI’m supposed to be moving to Greece at the end of March for a seven-month contract, but obviously with no flights this has been postponed for the foreseeable. This is extremely distressing as for dancers a summer season can sometimes be their only income for the year. With so much uncertainty, I’m not sure if I will ever get there to complete the season, and in the meantime I’m stuck in the UK with no income.Anonymous, 30, artistAs a self-employed artist, my work is piecemeal and precarious. I don’t have a fixed income and my earnings fluctuate month to month. I’m still in receipt of the ghostly working tax credits, which has been a lifeline in more difficult times but at £54 a week are not enough to live on. Occasionally I sell a work, pick up some teaching hours or am successful with a funding application. While the financial impact of Covid-19 is massive on those working in the arts, the impact of coronavirus goes beyond the loss of wages – it affects our visibility. Projects which have been in the pipeline for many months are put on hold, or no longer possible. Perhaps they lose their relevance as this global crisis escalates as it has. Galleries and cultural spaces rearrange their programmes, pushing an already competitive workforce into greater competition for places. This situation is complicated for us all, but without support, we risk a whole generation of artists slipping away.David, 32, artist and gallery workerMany artists work freelance as either an assistant to a more established artist, or as a technicianhandler for museums and galleries. I fall in this latter group. I love the work – we do anything from packing up prints to building gallery walls or making bespoke elements of the exhibition. With museums and galleries closed until further notice, the workforce who build and hang the exhibitions are simply not required. The work is always seasonal, and so we have large chunks of work booked months ahead, knowing that we have a two- to three-month gap in work while the exhibition is open to the public. I’ve had a mixed response to coronavirus closures. One gallery has said that it will honour booked work and pay freelancers regardless of whether we are physically able to complete the job. This is absolutely wonderful and will help hugely. It is, however, an exception rather than the norm. Most galleries and museums have cancelled work – I’ve lost work equivalent to two and a half months’ pay, and from talking to friends, that seems quite light.Jonny Byers, 39, cellistI had a full diary of work, and every single concert until at least July has been cancelled or, at best, postponed. An entire tour of a Handel opera a week of Beethoven symphonies concerts at smaller venues such as the Wigmore Hall. A completely empty diary, which means £0 coming in. Many of the groups I perform for won’t have a large amount of financial reserves so are now walking an even thinner tightrope attempting to ride out this storm. I have bills, instrument insurance, not to mention food buying, and many other outgoings to attempt to cover with no idea how it’s all going to pan out. Sadly, everyone is in the same boat right now, but once orchestras are gone, they’re gone, and we’ll need music more than ever after this.Dan, 37, stage managerOne show was cancelled mid-run and we were told not to come in the next day. The following job, which was supposed to take me to July, was postponed until 2021. All income has stopped and with no help from the government so far, we have had to contact our landlords and bill providers to plead for a payment break. We will get to a point where we have to choose between paying bills and eating. There is no safety net. I am also in the unfortunate situation that I have a very sick relative in hospital which, added to the worry about no income and possible eviction, is having a huge detrimental effect on my mental health.Anonymous, 30, freelance stage managerSo far, I have lost out on thousands. Last week, the tour that I was working on was cancelled after the government urged people not to go out. There were no compensation measures as all insurances were void when the WHO declared the virus a pandemic. The promoter took their fee back, tickets were refunded and the artist made a huge loss. All future bookings have been postponed too. A two-month project that I was meant to start on 1 April has been pushed back, but we don’t know when that will be rescheduled. Festivals have been cancelled. My next working day is currently 1 July, but that could also be postponed. That’s three and a half months of loss of earnings – and to add salt to my wounds, I’m due to get married overseas in September.Clare, 51, self-employed art tutorAs a result of the current situation I closed the studio last week. Many of the artists who attend are over 70, and although the classes are small I can’t guarantee safety. I have set up a WhatsApp group to keep us all in touch with each other – we share experiences, jokes and thoughts as well as art-related articles. Today, I launched an online art class to which nearly 40 of the group have signed up. So far, it seems to be working despite my lack of techie knowledge – think Acorn Antiques level of production. I hope this will provide some income to tide me over until I can reopen the studio, and will keep the social element of the group together.Anonymous, 45, community artistI work full time in the community and all my work is on freelance contracts. In two days, every project I have got cancelled as they are all people-based. I have no income, no sick pay, and my work diary is a black hole. I am used to uncertainty and flexibility in my work, but now I feel totally baffled as to how I will get an income. I don’t know when or if these projects will ever be rescheduled, and I worry about some of the people I work with who depend on the social aspect of these arts projects – one project I worked on involves making artworks for a recovery garden, for people with addictions, and I worry about how they are coping alone. We will be needed to help restore community spirit when this crisis is over – arts are never valued by the government, yet people are surviving these hard times through creativity and resourcefulness.Peter, 44, freelance opera singerThe theatres are shut. I’m fortunate enough to have current extra chorus contracts honoured, but future ones are undecided. With schools, each one has its own safeguarding policy and setting up teaching from home is problematic – hours are down already. All of the concerts I’ve had lined up are postponed or cancelled, auditionstoo. Regular chorister work in synagogue has stopped and the church that I regularly sing at are paying up to June. My private teaching has stopped – even though it’s a few students, over time you really start to feel it. I’m losing more than half of my income, with projected expectations that the industry will suffer longer and there will be less work in the future. I will need to adapt and find other sources.Gillian Garrity, 48, theatre producerMy business partner, Margaret-Anne O’Donnell, and I started our own producing company, Raw Material Arts, two years ago. We have worked in the theatre industry for more than 20 years each, touring theatre within the UK and across the world. A UKAustralian co-production that was due to tour to 12 venues across Scotland beginning next month has been cancelled a tour to an arts festival in Egypt has been cancelled an artist residency due to take place in Nepal has been cancelled we have three midlarge scale co-productions with three Scottish venues now on hold a New York transfer of a current production on hold. Our potential to earn income has frozen. We work with and employ directors, lighting designers, sound designers, actors, stage managers, costume designers and many more freelance artists. We have received support from Creative Scotland to pay our team for projects that have taken place andor are already funded, but we cannot deliver. We have no means to rehearse or present any work, meaning we have no potential to earn income.Anonymous, 39, stage managerI don’t know anyone who’s still working, the entire industry has gone. The theatres all shut once Boris Johnson advised people not to go – there was no more work to do. I went to help clear the rehearsal room we had been using and that was that. I’ve worked since I was 17, I’ve never not had a job. I’ve always paid my taxes and I’ve used the benefits system once to cover a gap of five weeks between contracts back when I first moved to London in 2009. Now I don’t know what to do. My partner is in the same position and has lost a year’s work, as has my sister, as have most of my friends. We have a little bit of a buffer, probably enough to survive the next month or two, but beyond that things are pretty scary. I’m happy to do whatever I need – I’ve handed out CVs in supermarkets, filled out forms online, but so far no replies. I just think people see theatre on a CV and don’t know what to do with it, or assume you’ll be some kind of luvvie who moans about breaking a nail. The reality is we’re used to 16-hour days, 50-plus hour weeks, hard physical work, problem solving and team working, not to mention working under pressure to a deadline. After all, the show must go on."},{"url":null,"title":"rachel cooke on criticism what is the point of a critic if not to tell the truth","story":"In this age of pile-ons and ‘cancellations’, complacency and cliques, how does a critic stay free-thinking and engaged? Our reviewer pauses for thought...When Mary Beard’s new BBC documentary series Shock of the Nude began last month, I had high hopes. A new censoriousness is abroad both in the art world, and in our wider culture, and I hoped that she might have something to say about this: something clear, clever and non-prurient. But alas, it was not to be. I disliked her approach to marble fig leaves and the male gaze, and in the New Statesman, where I am the television critic, I said so, calling the series out for what I regarded as its superficiality and modish solipsism. “She is the star,” I wrote. “And Michaelangelo, Courbet and all the rest of them can go hang.”I did not expect her to like this, but neither did I expect to hear that she didn’t like it. Beard, a Cambridge don, is smart and successful. I assumed she would rise above it given that I once gave a book of hers a rave review, she would know, moreover, that it wasn’t personal. But again, I was wrong. A few days later, Beard devoted the blog she writes for the Times Literary Supplement to TV criticism, having taken exception not only to my review, but to several others too. In it, she ticked each of us off inidually. (Had I, she wanted to know, ever considered how few TV minutes in the past had been devoted to Zoffany’s Tribuna?) She then called for a total rethink of TV criticism. It seems that Beard wants new, better TV critics, who will take a new, better approach to television. The inference is that what she really wants are TV critics who will universally praise everything that she does.Beard’s blog infuriated me, not for anything she had to say about my review (she’s entitled to disagree with me), but for the suggestion – one she appeared to reiterate later on social media – that I do not take TV seriously. This, of course, is a perennial problem for critics, particularly those who try to write entertainingly the criticised seem unaccountably to feel that if the critic has the temerity to make light of anything at all, they’re unworthy of the job, and idiotic to boot. In my case, however, the accusation could not be further from the truth. If I love television now – and I do – this is as nothing compared to how I felt about it when I was younger. Growing up, it was the principal means, apart from novels borrowed from the library, by which I educated myself: about art, culture, science, nature and, yes, human behaviour. I believe that those who discount television, who are patronising or snobbish about it, are telling you far more about themselves than they are about the medium itself.There are several things that qualify someone to be a critic. They require some expertise they must be able to write they should have taste (reviews have everything to do with taste – and nothing). But the most vital qualification is that they should love whatever it is that they write about. As the late AA Gill put it: “If you don’t love it, why will you care if somebody does it badly?” What I felt most of all when I watched Beard’s show was a sense of amazement that she and the BBC had together used our money, in the form of the licence fee, to make something so inert, so contentless, so strangely (for a programme about art) unbeautiful and ordinary. And so, like the boy in the fairy tale, I pointed at what I was watching – in this case, not a naked emperor, but a naked professor of classics (I mean this both literally and metaphorically, since Beard posed for a life drawing in the series) – and I laughed. Personally, I don’t believe you have to agree with me to think that I was right to do so. What is the point of a critic if not to tell the truth as they see it? I’ve written about Beard not to stir a feud, but because it illustrates so perfectly the current moment when it comes to criticism. In the 21st century, critics write in an environment where those who disagree with them, whether makers or consumers, can respond immediately and directly. Artists now quite often use social media to encourage their fans to diss the so-called experts, urging them on by telling them that they are right, not the critic. Beard doesn’t have the kind of groupies – assuming she has groupies at all – who go in for trolling, but many artists do, and when stirred, whether the incitement is deliberate or not, things can get out of control pretty quickly. Think of Samuel L Jackson, who in 2012 asked his Twitter followers if they could help the film critic AO Scott to find a new job, “one he can actually do” (Scott, of the New York Times, had been disobliging about Avengers Assemble, in which Jackson stars). Or think of Lana Del Rey, who last year tweeted her displeasure at Ann Powers’s review of her new album to her 9.5 million followers. The subsequent pile-on included calls for Del Rey to “end” Powers.You have to be quite tough – or at any rate, cool-headed – to put up with this kind of thing. But then, to be a critic, you have to be tough generally these days. Jobs are thin on the ground. For the past decade, newspapers, their budgets under threat and their determination to build online traffic driving their priorities in terms of copy, have been laying off large numbers of critics. Who will forget the day, in 2013, that the ill-fated Independent on Sunday sacked its entire team? Some art forms have been affected by this situation more than others: as Alex Ross, the New Yorker’s music writer, pointed out in a melancholy piece in 2017, fewer than a dozen American newspapers now have a full-time classical critic. And the realms of film and theatre are hardly immune. To take one example, in 2019, the Evening Standard, a newspaper cited “necessary cost-cutting” when laying off both of its long-standing theatre critics in favour of two writers with other roles on the paper.It being hard to make ends meet, the critical ecosystem grows ever more fragile. Many book critics, for instance, rely more and more on chairing events and running literary festivals for income, something that can – and does – take its effect on their reviews. Who is going to be negative about a book by a writer with whom they’ll shortly share a green room? Writers do tend to know one another their air kisses have long graced the literary pages. But the muffled sound of punches being pulled now emanates not only from, say, novelists who occasionally review, but from jobbing writers who make the majority of their income from criticism. Hatchet jobs still get written. These days, however, you’re more likely to find a perfectly ordinary book acclaimed as a “masterpiece”. Critical inflation is rife, and pity the innocent reader, about to rush out and buy a new hardback.And then there is the pressure that comes from places it shouldn’t. Editors who insist not only on star ratings, but who prefer one-star or five-star reviews (Mark Shenton, former theatre critic of the Sunday Express, claimed that he was once asked to “amend” his). Publishers and publicists who bear a grudge (a negative review for one writer may mean that you will not be given, say, an interview with another one from the same stable, irrespective of your enthusiasm for their work). Iniduals who attempt what we might call news management (Time Out’s arts editor, Eddy Frankel, recently revealed that one artist would not provide the magazine with images unless he or she was given copy approval of a review prior to publication). Organisations that have decided to go along with the notion that expertise counts for nothing. (Last year, English National Opera stopped giving critics a second ticket for performances in order to make more seats available to novice bloggers: “Opera can be seen as a closed art form, and we think people should be able to review it more emotionally... The question is: did it make you cry, did it make you happy?” said its chief executive, Stuart Murphy, of this decision.) How to work in such an environment, let alone to make a living? How to remain independent and free-thinking, passionate and engaged? It’s enough to make even the best of us give up.I don’t agree with those who assert that critics are simply those who can’t write a book, shoot a film, or paint a picture themselves, and that this therefore disqualifies them from the job (the singer Lizzo once claimed only musicians should be allowed to review albums). Yes, there are dance critics who used to be members of a ballet corps, and architecture critics who were trained to design buildings these people bring reserves of knowledge and experience. But when I published a book after years of having written about other people’s, it didn’t make me a better critic, nor even a more sympathetic one (in fact, I’m less tolerant now than before of books that are lazy or glib). Not being able to do something oneself is no guide at all to a person’s skills as a critic to their ability to notice what matters. “A critic is a man who knows the way, but can’t drive the car,” as the Observer’s great theatre critic, Kenneth Tynan, once put it.Nor do I think it matters if the critics and the public disagree – as happened with Taika Waititi’s Oscar-winning second world war story, Jojo Rabbit (the critics mainly loathed it the public absolutely loved it). Consensus is a growing problem in our culture. It is inescapably the case that some artists, like some kinds of art, are deemed to be beyond criticism – something that, in my view, stifles debate every bit as much as cancel culture (it also makes life very bland and boring). Lone voices, if their disagreement is based on knowledge and insight, are crucial, and when you hear such a cry in the dark, it’s often with a sense of relief. I felt this recently when I read the only review of the late Deborah Orr’s memoir Motherwell – by the journalist Janice Turner – that expressed any reservation at all about it (Turner pointed out that Orr’s obsession in the book with narcissism is completely bewildering unless you know – and how could you know? – that she is really writing about her ex-husband, Will Self).You will say that I have a vested interest in all this, and it’s true: I do. But there are lots of people, not only readers, but artists, too, who would miss critics if they were to disappear. “It completes the circle,” says Richard Eyre, the theatre and film director. “It’s good to have a dialogue between the work and a person who is assessing it. That is valuable.” When he ran the National Theatre in the 90s, he had to read a pile of cuttings every day. How much anxiety did this cause him? “A lot,” he says. “It was quite painful.” Did a review ever make him change his mind? “I think so, yes. The ones who write and argue in the context of what you’ve tried to do – you do listen, and sometimes you think: ‘Yes, of course I hadn’t realised it could be seen like that, but I do now.’”David Eldridge, the playwright, agrees. “I do read reviews. It would seem perverse not to. After all the work of writing the play, the love and the thought, and then the company pulling it together, it would be odd to avoid what people are saying about it. At their best, the critics can really share something of an evening in the theatre with their readers – and they can keep artists honest. But I tend to think reviews are most useful months after the play has closed, when you can be more reflective and thoughtful. I think they’re good at picking up something being amiss, even if their diagnosis as to the cause is wrong.” Reviews have made a real difference to his career – in both directions. Jack Tinker in the Daily Mail turned his first play, Serving It Up, into a hot ticket the New York Times helped to close Festen on Broadway after only four weeks when it “poured a cup of cold sick” over it: “I felt very hurt.” But a writer’s relationship with critics can be about more than bums on seats. He believes that the best critics helped to inform his “sense of self as a writer and artist” by spotting his early promise and then, later, suggesting that he’d fulfilled it.Richard Eyre grew up reading, in the Observer, the film critic Penelope Gilliatt, and Ken Tynan – “You had to see what their view was, because it mattered” – and he believes that, at its highest level, criticism can be a work of art in its own right. Which brings us back to where we started: with my jokes about Mary Beard and her nudes. In the end, it’s the job of the critic not only to inform, to challenge, to try to put something down for posterity, but to entertain to use words to dazzle the reader with a sense of exactitude to cause a feeling of rightness and sudden conviction to fall on them like – to pinch from Philip Larkin – an enormous yes (Larkin, by the way, was a brilliant critic). Criticism that can do these things is not disposable. It’s as timeless, sometimes, as the thing it describes.When I finish talking to Eyre, I carry out a small experiment, opening at random a copy of Tynan Left \u0026amp Right, a collection of his work from 1967. The first thing I see is a review of a play that was, until recently, on at the Almeida theatre in London: The Duchess of Malfi by John Webster. Naturally, the actors who were then appearing in it at the Aldwych – Peggy Ashcroft and Eric Porter – are both long dead his thoughts about their performances don’t really interest me. But every word of what he says about Webster – to which he devotes most of his review – is so thrillingly veracious as to be almost preposterous. (“Ideally, one feels, he would have had all his characters drowned in a sea of cold sweat,” Tynan writes of the playwright’s horrible way with his own creations.) Here was a review that felt brand new: as alive to me in 2020 as it must have been to the subeditor who received it late one night in 1960 and, realising in an instant it was pure gold, treated himself to another cigarette."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc63932315d2ab8fbcb83575c103add1e5d1f9ba/149_0_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90759b5ba4c348c46bf3fa93ed1f2343","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a puma on the streets of Santiago, Chile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031262bddfcd580335a4f3d631c358ed8cb8645d/715_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f877cbff611e7da80a814419fba7c092","title":"the perfect candidate review a saudi womans political awakening","story":"A female doctor hits the campaign trail in Saudi Arabia, in a rousing if occasionally hoary battle against oppression A Saudi female doctor runs for local government, causing consternation in a community still wrestling with the idea of female emancipation, in Haifaa Al-Mansour’s second Saudi-set feature, following her debut, Wadjda.

The move drew criticism from a number of clubs, including Barnsley, who said they were not consulted until shortly before the plans were made public and urged the FA to “immediately reconsider” the decision.As a part of that announcement the FA said it “remains in consultation with the Barclays FA Women’s Super League and FA Women’s Championship Board and clubs regarding the most appropriate way to complete the current season including the Barclays FA Women’s Super League Academy”.In a conference call on Friday, those discussions resulted in several options being put to clubs: teams return to training in three weeks the return to training is pushed back by a few weeks each time, with resumption only when it is deemed safe to do so and, if the other possibilities prove unfeasible, that both seasons are voided.The FA was notified of clubs’ estimated losses for March, April and May during the week and there was a sense of disbelief from some at the lack of financial support alongside the extension to the season stretching into the foreseeable future. However, there is also a feeling that the governing body may have viewed the losses as too big a gap to plug and the FA is now trying to protect the existing budget for the women’s game.Clubs must prepare to keep paying players until a decision is reached on continuation or cancellation. With the tight finances of teams not backed by a Premier League club and the season stretching far beyond what the other clubs have budgeted for, it is increasingly likely some clubs will go to the wall – a possibility hinted at in advance of the meeting when the FA told clubs they may need to reopen licensing to maintain numbers in the Women’s Championship.Although the top two women’s tiers will not lose anything like the sums the men’s equivalents will, the sporting implications are similar. The Women’s Super League title was far from a foregone conclusion when play was suspended on 13 March: Manchester City, who have a one-point lead over Chelsea and are four better off than Arsenal, have played a game more than that pair and only the first and second-placed sides qualify for the Champions League.While Liverpool’s men’s team have an almost unassailable lead at the top of the Premier League, things are a lot less rosy for the women. They languish at the bottom of the WSL table with one win, a point behind Birmingham but having played a game more.In the Championship, Aston Villa are six points clear of Sheffield United at the top. At the bottom, Charlton, who have played 12 games, are two points behind Coventry United, who have played 14, and Lewes, who have played 12."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9788364422aeb2f0ac8fe9c3b6e1e7392e340b2/0_0_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352b123b673ee2924f15fb66e48cc62a","title":"premier league clubs change last summer","story":"Tottenham and Manchester City are among the clubs who would probably make very different decisions if they could reset the Premier League as if it were Football ManagerThe season must be completed. The season must be abandoned now. As the arguments gabble on, only occasionally acknowledging their own hypothetical nature given how little we know about how the virus will proceed, how long the lockdown may last and whether there may be a second wave of infections when it is lifted, it’s tempting t o dip into another hypothetical. What if this were like a game of Football Manager? What if we could quit without saving and go back and start again last summer? What would Premier League clubs, given their time over, do differently?Let’s start with the obvious one: Tottenham’s decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino and replace him with José Mourinho. Once a path has been embarked on, there is perhaps some logic in pursuing it to its conclusion, but would Daniel Levy really take that road again? Tottenham are without a win in their past six games. They’ve gone out of the FA Cup and Champions League. They’re seven points adrift of fourth. They’ve kept three clean sheets in 26 games under Mourinho. For Spurs, this season has been a shambles.Injuries haven’t helped, while Mourinho loyalists point to a creaking and jaded squad. But if the squad is an excuse for Mourinho, why was it not for Pochettino? It’s not as though he wasn’t aware of its failings, not as though he hadn’t been campaigning for two years for greater transfer spending.Levy, given the choice between replacing the manager or the bulk of the squad, went for the manager, but it looks as if he will end up having to replace the bulk of the squad as well. And when it comes down to it, which would you rather have: a thrusting manager with a point to prove and a recent history of team-building on a budget or a weary former great who has come increasingly to deal in big transfers and whose ideas have begun to look outmoded?In terms of other managerial comings and goings, Watford may think they could have sacked Javi Gracia in the summer rather than waiting until September and they certainly wouldn’t bother again with the 12 games under Quique Sánchez Flores. Everton, Arsenal and West Ham, perhaps, will think that they could have acted more swiftly to arrest seasons that were drifting.In terms of the top of the table, Liverpool would presumably change very little, although they might perhaps look at what happened around the winter break and wonder if something in their schedule led to the slight loss of rhythm in February and early March. Given how the Atlético game turned out, they might also look at upgrading their reserve goalkeeper.For Manchester City, though, there is one clear problem that they would surely take steps to address: the lack of cover at centre-back. The departure of Vincent Kompany inevitably risked leaving a vacuum of leadership, but there was no need for there also to be a vacuum of defensive nous. With Nicolás Otamendi always a slightly rash and clumsy figure, the least obviously Guardiolista player in the squad, and John Stones’s form uncertain, City were left extremely dependent on Aymeric Laporte. That he has started seven league games this season is the major reason the gap to Liverpool is so vast, not only because of his absence but because Fernandinho has been lost to the midfield as he has been forced to drop back as an emergency central defender.Manchester United’s case is intriguing. Given their improvement after the arrival of Bruno Fernandes – they have won six and drawn three games since signing him at the end of January – they would presumably try to land him in the summer. Harry Maguire, assuming United still deemed him worth the £80m fee, would probably have been signed earlier in the summer to give him more time to adjust to his new teammates the attempt to drive down the fee by drawing out negotiations simply did not work.Given that Paul Pogba has started five league games this season and none since September, offloading him last summer presumably would be a priority surely nobody now, even at United, thinks a positive future still awaits him at the club? And there are those, too, who would argue that Ole Gunnar Solskjær should have been replaced when Pochettino became available, although recent form has perhaps begun to soften the concerns about the Norwegian’s long-term suitability for the job.What about signings that clubs would now avoid? Would City spend £58.5m on João Cancelo, who has started eight league games? Newcastle, surely, would not spend £40m on Joelinton, a forward wholly unsuited to the isolated frontman role he has been asked to fulfil. Spurs might still splash out £54m on Tanguy Ndombele, but not if they still planned to bring in Mourinho. Aston Villa, perhaps, would rethink their entire transfer strategy: they spent £140m to no great effect. While the injury to Wesley was unfortunate, only Tyrone Mings has been a clear success. West Ham would probably reconsider their transfer policy, but it’s hard to think of the last season when that wouldn’t have been the case.Leicester and Chelsea presumably wouldn’t change too much, although Frank Lampard might start using Olivier Giroud earlier given the opportunity. But perhaps the most interesting case of a club with little to fix is Norwich. It is easy to say that they should have spent more, that a splurge on a couple of high-class players might make the difference for them.But given the financial constraints under which they operate, it’s not clear how much more they could have done. Daniel Farke is a consistently engaging coach whose young team play attractive, bright football. It wouldn’t have taken much to have gone differently for them not to be adrift at the bottom.That, perhaps, is the key: the league table doesn’t lie, but it cannot be considered without context. And that’s where asking, given context, what might reasonably have been improved feels useful. No audit can look only at results."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7725e2ac69633e6cb324e834da8f7001c9b63d45/0_253_4164_2499/master/4164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94c05233465d3b0f2d223ecd1105f389","title":"stranded britons quoted 40000 each to fly home from new zealand","story":"Foreign Office accused of failing thousands marooned by pandemic around the worldBritons stranded abroad due to the coronavirus pandemic are being faced with flights home costing more than £40,000, prompting a wave of accusations that the Foreign Office is failing to adequately support people desperate to come home.Britons in New Zealand told the Observer that the only available flights to the UK are prohibitively priced with even the cheaper tickets costing as much as £15,000. A Qatari Airlines flight from Auckland to London on 31 March was priced at NZ$83,534 (£40,096).Those stranded say they have been left without guidance or assistance after the UK embassy and consular services in New Zealand abruptly closed their doors last week.Marine engineer Tim Johnson, 30, from Norwich, who is stuck in Auckland with his wife Nikki, said: “The cost of the flights has been far out of reach of the people stranded. Yet the embassy and Foreign Office lauded these flights as a diplomatic breakthrough.”There is growing anger among British nationals who point to the example of European countries which have sent planes to repatriate their citizens at affordable prices.“The German government chartered a whole bunch of Lufthansa and Condor planes. A lot of Europeans have been repatriated without needing to kick up a fuss,” Johnson added.NHS doctors, as well as iniduals who have lost their jobs, their home or who are running out of medication are believed to be among an estimated 6,000 Britons marooned in New Zealand.In India details emerged of Britons stranded in Goa who were running out of food and felt increasingly targeted by some locals who blamed them for spreading coronavirus.Further south, concern is growing over a group of elderly British citizens who have been detained in hospital isolation in Kochi, Kerala, for more than a week. The group, aged between 60 and 83, have all tested positive for Covid-19 and relatives fear they are being held in unsanitary conditions.

Similar provisions to those in the act were contained in a previous law that was declared unconstitutional in 2005.The police used the law to brutally disperse rallies organised by opposition politician Kizza Besigye in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, and more recently to block meetings and concerts by pop star turned politician Bobi Wine.In a tweet, Besigye said: “Congratulations @nickopiyo \u0026amp the petitioners for this important court decision nullifying Uganda’s obnoxious POMA Law! Without rule of law however, Uganda police will continue to act with impunity (as it did before this law was made) but without a false cover. Shame on Uganda parliament.”Dr Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director of the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative, welcomed the ruling, saying it had been “an obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in Uganda”.“Granting unfettered powers to police to deny, disperse and block meetings had a chilling effect on the democratic rights of Ugandans, particularly the political opposition, human rights defenders and activists,” he said.Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s director for east and southern Africa, said the law had been used as a tool of repression.“Under this law police have brutally dispersed spontaneous demonstrations and opposition rallies, while opposition politicians have been beaten up and arrested simply for exercising their rights,” she said, adding that Ugandan lawmakers must now repeal the entire act, which contradicted the constitution, ahead of next year’s presidential elections.In January, police arrested Wine and fired teargas at his supporters when he tried to hold a rally to mark his 2021 presidential bid.Since he became a legislator in 2017, Wine has rattled Ugandan authorities, who see him as a threat to President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni has been in power since 1986.Joel Ssenyonyi, spokesperson for Wine’s People Power Movement, said he was concerned that the ruling would be ignored. “This government is notorious for disregarding court orders,” he said.Sarah Kasande, of the International Centre for Transitional Justice, said the move “will open up space for political activists and human rights defenders to exercise their rights to peacefully assemble, and to debate public policies and advocate for change”.

My education and life chances were the most important things to my parents. That gave me a tremendous sense of: what am I going to do with my life? How am I going to use this life I’ve been given?Some of the things my parents did were tough. They weren’t happy with the education options in Saudi Arabia, so at 12 I was sent to boarding school in the UK. It was hard to be thousands of miles away, but now I feel incredibly fortunate. It was character building. It taught me to be independent.Nerves are always a part of my life. I don’t necessarily feel them every second I am on air, but I do during the bigger moments – the bigger interviews. There’s always an element of the unknown. Sometimes the adrenaline can be overwhelming.The closest I came to death was when I was covering the elections in India in 2014, in Aligarh. We went to a political rally and as the sound of Narendra Modi’s helicopter was heard overhead, the crowd suddenly surged forward. It was absolutely terrifying, that sensation of struggling to breathe, all these people behind me. It was Chris, my cameraman, who rescued me. He managed to pick me up and haul me over a fence.I associate getting older with reaching new heights in my career – and feeling more at ease with myself. I’m 47 now.

There’s a certain apprehension that might creep in at that point about what old age is going to look and feel like.People say communication is the secret to a happy marriage. I think it’s more specific than that. It’s so easy to forget the basic niceties. Treating each other with civility is so important.I try to accept uncertainty – that there are things in life that are going to be out of my control. Whenever I’m faced with an uncertain situation, I always think: what is in my power to do right now? That’s a bit of a mantra in my life.I’m neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I would describe myself as a realist. I think that is connected to the work I do. I spend my working life trying to establish facts, what is happening and why it matters.

It is like the X Factor. Imagine what would happen if any one of these recordings got into the public domain, with us laying out our plans for the future and saying how wonderful it felt to have won. The unrealistic nature of it all just about sums up the last five years.”Another candidate said: “It is impossible to see how anyone can record something in advance like this with any conviction. It is not going to happen.”It is now expected that some other method will be found so that brief acceptance speeches can be made on the day of the announcement by the two winners.Under the current plans the candidates to succeed outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn and his former deputy Tom Watson will be informed of the result a few minutes before it is made public.The deputy leadership is being contested by Angela Rayner, Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Dawn Butler.The original plan had to been to gather at least 1,000 party members and senior figures at a special conference in London to announce the new leader.Starmer is the bookies’ favourite to win the contest for leader while Angela Rayner is regarded by many as frontrunner for the deputy post. On Friday Rayner announced she was “self-isolating” after suffering symptoms of coronavirus.She said on Twitter: “I am now in self isolation as I have the symptoms of #Coronavirus they started last night and have gradually got worse. I will be a bit quieter than usual but will still be keeping in touch with people as best as l can.”In an interview with the BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Corbyn said the country had been “ill-prepared” for the coronavirus pandemic because of “10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794f32492b33402920cca8ac58fc6cf8a41f56db/0_0_979_587/master/979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eba9571a3427dfce11637d044a34a49","title":"scientists discover three new species of pterosaurs in the sahara","story":"Scientists have discovered three new species of flying reptiles that lived in the Sahara 100m years ago.Prof David Martill, a palaeontologist at the University of Portsmouth, made the discovery with a team of researchers from Morocco and the US.The study, published in the Cretaceous Research journal, has revealed a community of pterosaurs that inhabited prehistoric Morocco.A university spokeswoman said: “The new finds show that African pterosaurs were quite similar to those found on other continents.“These flying predators soared above a world dominated by predators, including crocodile-like hunters and carnivorous dinosaurs. Interestingly, herbivores such as sauropods and ornithischian dinosaurs are rare.“Many of the predators, including the toothed pterosaurs, preyed on a superabundance of fish.”Martill said: “We are in a golden age for discovering pterodactyls. This year alone we have discovered three new species and we are only into March.”The new pterosaurs – identified from chunks of jaws and teeth found in the middle cretaceous Kem Kem beds of Morocco – had wings of three to four metres.The spokeswoman said: “These aerial fishers snatched up their prey while on the wing, using a murderous-looking set of large spike-like teeth that formed a highly effective tooth grab.“Large pterosaurs such as these would have been able to forage over vast distances, similar to present-day birds such as condors and albatrosses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deefdfcc0a22748ef120307e4f9a8f79b8709230/0_169_5036_3022/master/5036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=361c64c87818801160f529e8db1f637e","title":"the more vaccine projects we have the better our chances","story":"Leading scientist Adam Finn warns of stumbles along the way to Covid-19 immunisationThe chances of an inidual Covid-19 vaccine project producing a successful outcome are low, one of Britain’s leading immunisation experts has warned. “Science does not have a track record where most of our vaccine projects work,” Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University said last week. “We have a track record where most of them don’t work.”Finn’s warning came as doctors and epidemiologists stressed how difficult it would be to contain the disease until people can be immunised against it.The crucial point is that if inidual projects have low prospects of success, many different approaches will have to be taken to find one that does provide protection against Covid-19.“It is like the Grand National,” said Finn. “A lot of horses start off but only a few make it to the finishing line. And that is why we are going to need a lot of different vaccine projects to start off with – because only one or two are likely to make it to become fully fledged vaccines. This is not a one-horse race.“At present, I would estimate there are at least 60 Covid-19 vaccine projects that have started up or are in planning. But the more there are, the better things will be.”Most Covid-19 vaccine projects that have been announced so far have been for a type known as RNADNA vaccines. These involve taking genetic material from a virus and injecting into animals or human volunteers. This approach is quicker than other methods which typically involve creating pieces of a virus and using them to stimulate a person’s immune system against it.However, RNADNA vaccines – which are a recent development – have yet to be developed for use in human beings. “They are quicker to start up but we have much less experience with them compared with standard approaches.”All these projects have promise, Finn stressed, but most of those being launched to tackled Covid-19 were unlikely to work in the end. “The trouble is that we do not have a technology that allows us to be confident from the outset that a vaccine will be effective.”In addition, vaccines that do stimulate strong immune responses can also have adverse side-effects or may even make a disease worse. An example is provided by Dengue fever, which is spread by mosquitoes in Asia and South America. “A vaccine was developed to protect children against one type of Dengue,” said Finn. “Then it was found that it actually made them more susceptible to a second type of the disease.”For these reasons, vaccines have to be put through lengthy trials to ensure any dangerous side-effects are revealed. “We will have been cautious and not rush forward,” Finn added.On the other hand, it was possible that one of the projects would produce a vaccine that just sailed along, he said. It might turn out to be easy to manufacture, have no side-effects, produce a good immune response, while in trials it prevented volunteers from getting sick compared with those in a control group. For good measure,a factory would be ready to manufacture it.“In those circumstances, you would have a vaccine in less than a year,” said Finn. “But it is almost certainly not going to happen like that. There will be stumbles along the way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e2dbe88e923123a61076bd918e17b6a802b4e7/0_94_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2accd12cd2b432b3cbdb6cac25883c2a","title":"conor mcgregor military enforce ireland coronavirus lockdown","story":"Conor McGregor has called on the military to be deployed to help enforce Ireland’s increased coronavirus lockdown.On Friday night, the Irish government told people to stay at home for two weeks in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus.

I would rather have one or two full tournaments, because if you do then play that tournament or two tournaments it is so much more rewarding to win it.“I would rather concentrate on two full tournaments than saying, ‘We have four tournaments that we need to play, let’s get them all in even if we have to shorten them.’ I think you would rather have two tournaments played full length so there is meaningful cricket at the end of it.”Cook, England’s record run-scorer, is set to be part of the Essex squad again this season as they bid to retain their Division One and T20 Blast trophies. But he admits they are simply having to wait to see if and when the season might get up and running.“As an Essex squad we are just doing what everyone else is doing,” Cook added.“We are just waiting to see when we are allowed back into the County Ground, when we are able to meet up again and hit balls as a group. Up until that time we just have to sit and wait.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a631a717f0bad548efa27e612f27a4a1e4cbeee/0_16_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7171ef1dc74751111ff0f0b01e23c16f","title":"coe and ovetts olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied thatcher","story":"British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows was determined not to join the Moscow Games boycott in 1980, to the fury of the prime ministerSir Denis Follows, 71, short and bald, started every day’s work by opening his post. It was a habit he’d had as secretary of the Football Association, and a habit he kept as chairman of the British Olympic Association. In between the two jobs, he’d been knighted. Which was some going, for the son of a stationmaster, but it hadn’t changed him much. He still wore a pair of thick horn rims, still worried about putting on weight, was still the same avuncular, pragmatic man who had kept the Jules Rimet trophy under his bed and carried it out to Mexico 70 in his briefcase. And he still had the same set of principles.First among them his idea that sport was above politics. Follows was so ­adamant about this that his own daughter still isn’t sure which way he voted, and that adamancy made him one of the key figures in what the Labour parliamentarian Denis Howell described as “the most epic political battle in which I have ever been engaged”.On Tuesday 22 January 1980, Follows’s morning mail included a ­letter from the prime ­minister, Margaret Thatcher. A month ­earlier, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan six months later, the Soviet Union was due to host the Olympics. Thatcher and the US ­president, Jimmy Carter, had already decided on a boycott. Thatcher’s foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, pointed out that there was just one problem: “participation is not a ­matter for governments”, but the national Olympic associations. All the government could do was advise on a course of action.Still, when the prime minister willed it, when the president of the US wanted it, how much of a ­problem could it really be? Looking back on the Moscow boycott 40 years later, with the benefit of all Thatcher’s declassified papers, briefings and correspondence, the most striking thing about it is how this one man, Sir Denis Follows, an elderly bureaucrat, squared up to the two most ­powerful leaders in the western world and stared them down.“In an ideal world, I would share entirely the philosophy of the Olympic movement that sport should be orced from politics, sadly, however, this is no longer a realistic view,” Thatcher wrote. To go to Moscow “would be to give the ­appearance of condoning” the ­invasion. It didn’t occur to her that Follows might ­disagree. She pressed ahead with asking him to “approach the International Olympic Committee urgently and propose that the Summer Games be moved from the Soviet Union”. She was convinced the Games should be relocated and suggested Britain could co-host them.Thatcher had made a mistake here, as the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, took great pleasure in explaining to Carrington. Her idea to move the Games at six months’ notice was “a still-born child”, Schmidt said. “Those who proposed it had no concept of the organisation of international sport.” But she stuck with it and had a working party run up a list of available venues, even after Follows had told her that the IOC’s response to her idea was “not ­difficult to imagine”.So Thatcher ramped up her ­rhetoric. “The Soviet government hope as another government did in 1936 that the Games will give an immense boost to the state’s prestige internationally,” she told parliament. “The solution is to move the Games to a place where politics do not predominate.” (The Labour MP Eric Heffer called out: “Where’s that? The moon?”)Carter, who was facing an election in the autumn, was so glad for her support that he wrote her a “Dear Margaret” to express his “deep personal appreciation” for her speech and applaud her “leadership in launching the Olympic boycott”. In private, her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, was briefing that Thatcher had won over “the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain” to the boycott. Or so they thought.Then, on 1 February, Follows sent his full reply. There was “little or no support for the suggestion the Games be moved” he said. As for the ­boycott, it wasn’t just his decision, but had to be made by a committee of the heads of each of the inidual sports ­federations. They were due to vote on 4 March but had postponed until 25 March, because they had “no desire to embarrass the government”. Follows told Thatcher to “rest assured your views will be considered”.Thatcher didn’t “rest assured”. Three days later, the cabinet started discussing the possibility of withdrawing all their funding to the Sports Council, who funnelled public money to the BOA. It decided not to. But there were other levers to pull. The government talked to the BBC about cancelling coverage, British Airways about cancelling charter flights to Moscow and the BOA’s corporate partners about cancelling sponsorship. Bupa did and the BOA were left scrabbling to scrape together funds in a public fundraising drive, boosted by support from the unions and several Labour councils.Thatcher wrote again to Follows: “For British athletes to go would be for them to seem to condone an international crime.” She decided to deny leave to all civil service, military and police personnel who were due to compete. That, Follows said, “rather stiffened” his resolve. When he was called in to face the foreign affairs select committee, he fired back. “Boycotts never do anyone any good,” he said. “Sport helps to bridge the gulf between nations, it is the most unifying thing in the world today.” Follows did promise the BOA would “not ignore” a vote in the Commons on the boycott. But he didn’t promise they would obey it.The MPs voted for the boycott by 315 to 147. Thatcher, who had said she was astonished by Follows’s stance at the select committee, wrote to him again. She was more placatory this time. “We have the highest admiration for the Olympic ideals. It is not we who are perverting that ideal rather, it is the Soviet Union.”By now, Carter’s special counsel, Lloyd Cutler, had flown to Europe to meet Follows. Cutler was clear the success of the boycott turned on how Thatcher handled the BOA. “The prospects for the political success of the boycott remain good provided the impending British defection can be deferred or contained,” Cutler said. The problem was Follows. “Sir Denis is a living Colonel Blimp,” he told Carter. “He is a pure Olympian who puts aside all responsibilities as a ­citizen of the west in favour of sports as the last hope of world peace. His views of Mrs Thatcher and the president are visibly apoplectic.” The feeling was mutual.Follows told Cutler he was ­“perfectly willing to have the British team be the only western European team in Moscow because this would show the BOA followed Olympic principles while the others bowed to their governments” even though “he knows the effect on the British government’s prestige at home and abroad will be disastrous”.On 25 March, the BOA voted to go to the Moscow Games. “Serves her right,” said Schmidt. Thatcher warned that it was “not the end of the matter”. In the Commons, the Conservative Cranley Onslow blamed Follows’ “thick skull” for causing “a national disgrace”, and his colleague Keith Best asked Thatcher to “write a charming letter to Sir Denis Follows not necessarily describing any part of his anatomy”.But Thatcher was wrong. It was the end of the matter.

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

We are now where you will be in a few days. The epidemic’s charts show us all entwined in a parallel dance.We are but a few steps ahead of you in the path of time, just like Wuhan was a few weeks ahead of us. We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say “it’s only a flu, why all the fuss?” and those who have already understood.As we watch you from here, from your future, we know that many of you, as you were told to lock yourselves up into your homes, quoted Orwell, some even Hobbes. But soon you’ll be too busy for that.First of all, you’ll eat. Not just because it will be one of the few last things that you can still do.You’ll find dozens of social networking groups with tutorials on how to spend your free time in fruitful ways. You will join them all, then ignore them completely after a few days.You’ll pull apocalyptic literature out of your bookshelves, but will soon find you don’t really feel like reading any of it.You’ll eat again. You will not sleep well. You will ask yourselves what is happening to democracy.You’ll have an unstoppable online social life – on Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom…You will miss your adult children like you never have before the realisation that you have no idea when you will ever see them again will hit you like a punch in the chest.Old resentments and falling-outs will seem irrelevant. You will call people you had sworn never to talk to ever again, so as to ask them: “How are you doing?” Many women will be beaten in their homes.You will wonder what is happening to all those who can’t stay home because they don’t have one. You will feel vulnerable when going out shopping in the deserted streets, especially if you are a woman. You will ask yourselves if this is how societies collapse. Does it really happen so fast? You’ll block out these thoughts and when you get back home you’ll eat again.You will put on weight. You’ll look for online fitness training.You’ll laugh. You’ll laugh a lot. You’ll flaunt a gallows humour you never had before. Even people who’ve always taken everything dead seriously will contemplate the absurdity of life, of the universe and of it all.You will make appointments in the supermarket queues with your friends and lovers, so as to briefly see them in person, all the while abiding by the social distancing rules.You will count all the things you do not need.The true nature of the people around you will be revealed with total clarity. You will have confirmations and surprises.Literati who had been omnipresent in the news will disappear, their opinions suddenly irrelevant some will take refuge in rationalisations which will be so totally lacking in empathy that people will stop listening to them. People whom you had overlooked, instead, will turn out to be reassuring, generous, reliable, pragmatic and clairvoyant.Those who invite you to see all this mess as an opportunity for planetary renewal will help you to put things in a larger perspective. You will also find them terribly annoying: nice, the planet is breathing better because of the halved CO2 emissions, but how will you pay your bills next month?You will not understand if witnessing the birth of a new world is more a grandiose or a miserable affair.You will play music from your windows and lawns. When you saw us singing opera from our balconies, you thought “ah, those Italians”. But we know you will sing uplifting songs to each other too. And when you blast I Will Survive from your windows, we’ll watch you and nod just like the people of Wuhan, who sung from their windows in February, nodded while watching us.Many of you will fall asleep vowing that the very first thing you’ll do as soon as lockdown is over is file for orce.Many children will be conceived.Your children will be schooled online. They’ll be horrible nuisances they’ll give you joy.Elderly people will disobey you like rowdy teenagers: you’ll have to fight with them in order to forbid them from going out, to get infected and die.You will try not to think about the lonely deaths inside the ICU.You’ll want to cover with rose petals all medical workers’ steps.You will be told that society is united in a communal effort, that you are all in the same boat. It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same."},{"url":null,"title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"For our second episode we want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it.

It will be that when you look at the different heights, the lower rooftops will be mainly green and the higher ones will be mainly solar panels. And now again a combination of the two because solar panels need some cooling.“The green can offer the cooling for the solar panels to function properly. It will be a regulation: all roofs are used.”Utrecht, the fastest growing city in the Netherlands, was rated in a 2019 study by Natuur \u0026amp Milieu as the most “sustainable” in the country in terms of buying green electricity, its use of environmental zones, exploitation of solar power and encouragement of cycling.The municipality completed the installation of green roofs on its 316 bus stops last year, capturing fine particles of air pollution, storing rainwater, and providing cooling during the summer months.The bus stops roofs are planted with sedum, a plant with small yellow flowers in the summer months, draws birds, bees and butterflies. The bus stops, fitted with bamboo benches, feature energy-efficient LED lighting and 96 of them have been outfitted with solar panels.The bases of the shelters are made of recycled concrete and the municipality says the maintenance will be carried out solely by electric vehicles. The city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, plans to use “completely clean public transport” by 2028 with the electricity used to power the buses being produced by Dutch windmills.The 300ft-high Utrecht vertical forest, a landmark building in the newly greened city centre, will comprise 200 apartments. Its facade, roof and balconies will be filled with around half the trees and shrubs presently found in Central Park in New York.Its developers claim it will absorb about 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year and produce about 41 tonnes of oxygen, equivalent to that generated by a hectare of forest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f6705cd79ed15da6fe5ebf8ce75cc06bc2ad5e/0_305_5763_3458/master/5763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe687be7b3954c242331e1d7ff821eb","title":"as the rest of europe lives under lockdown sweden keeps calm and carries on","story":"All its neighbours have shut up shop to beat coronavirus but the Swedes insist ‘we are not in quarantine’. Is that the right approach?If there’s been a fall in custom at the Nyhavn restaurant, it’s hardly noticeable. Groups of drinkers huddle under heat lamps out on Möllevång Square, the centre of nightlife in the Swedish city of Malmö, seemingly oblivious to the virus spreading through Europe.“It’s the Swedish trust in government,” says Elias Billman, 22. “No one told me you have to stay home right now,” agrees his friend, Fredrik Glückman, a history student at Lund University. “We’re not in quarantine. And as soon as we hear from our government that we have to stay in, like you do in Britain, then we will do it.”While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.Universities have been closed, and on Friday, the government tightened the ban on events to limit them to no more than 50 people. But if you develop symptoms, you can still go back to work or school just two days after you feel better. If a parent starts showing symptoms, they’re allowed to continue to send their children to school.It has only been in the past couple of days that the death toll has started to increase significantly, rising by a third in a single day on Thursday and Friday, with 92 people now dead and 209 in intensive care. As he announced the tighter restrictions on Friday, the prime minister, Stefan Löfven, warned that the coming weeks and months would be tough.But he defended the decision not to implement the tighter restrictions seen in Denmark, France and the UK. “We all, as iniduals, have to take responsibility. We can’t legislate and ban everything,” he said. “It is also a question of commonsense behaviour.”Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, believes it is counterproductive to bring in the tightest restrictions at too early a stage. “As long as the Swedish epidemic development stays at this level,” he tells the Observer, “I don’t see any big reason to take measures that you can only keep up for a very limited amount of time.”His team at the Public Health Agency of Sweden is critical of the Imperial College paper that warned this month that 250,000 people in the UK would die if the government failed to introduce more draconian measures. A week later Johnson ordered the police to implement a partial lockdown to combat the virus, telling people they “must stay at home”.“We have had a fair amount of people looking at it and they are sceptical,” says Tegnell. “They think Imperial chose a number of variables that gave a prognosis that was quite pessimistic, and that you could just as easily have chosen other variables that gave you another outcome. It’s not a peer-reviewed paper. It might be right, but it might also be terribly wrong. In Sweden, we are a bit surprised that it’s had such an impact.”The best explanation for why Sweden is such an outlier centres on the unusual level of independence given to government agencies such as Tegnell’s, and the reluctance of politicians to override them.“I feel that the Swedish government is handling this very reasonably,” argues Erika Lindquist, who is drinking with her brother and Danish husband at another table at the Nyhavn. “They’re listening to the health department they’re listening to the experts they have on hand.”There is criticism, however. More than 2,000 Swedish university researchers published a joint letter on Wednesday questioning the Public Health Agency’s position, while the previous week saw leading epidemiologists attack the agency in emails leaked to Swedish television.“How many lives are they willing to sacrifice so as not to lockdown and risk greater effects on the economy?” asked one, Joacim Rocklöv, a professor of epidemiology at Umeå University.Tegnell argues that because in Sweden there are almost no stay-at-home parents, closing schools would have knocked out at least a quarter of doctors and nurses, crippling the health service. By pushing children out into society, it might even have increased the threat to the elderly, particularly if they were called upon to babysit.He points out that Sweden has almost no households where the over-70s live with younger adults and children.Tegnell even questions whether stopping the progress of the virus is desirable. “We are just trying to slow it, because this disease will never go away. If you manage, like South Korea, to get rid of it, even they say that they count on it coming back. Stopping it might even be negative, because you would have a pent-up possible spread of the disease, and then once you open the gates, there is a possibility that there would be an even worse outcome.”While Tegnell understands that he will be blamed if Sweden ends up in a similar situation to that of Italy, he refuses to be panicked. “I wouldn’t be too surprised if it ended up about the same way for all of us, irrespective of what we’re doing,” he says. “I’m not so sure that what we’re doing is affecting the spread very much. But we will see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest 28 march at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has reached 640,589, with 29,848 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Here’s how to navigate the new rulesWith lockdown conditions imposed in many countries to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus, everyday activities such as shopping are going to be different from usual for some time.Here are some tips on how to practise physical distancing while purchasing essential food and medical supplies.Keep clear of people on the way to and from the shops, and when inside them as well, if possible. Be patient and take your turn to access goods in fridges and freezers. Some supermarkets are helping to do this by limiting the number of people who can be inside a shop at any given time. When purchasing your shopping, try to keep your distance from shop workers as well. With self-service checkouts and pin pads, you may have no choice but to come into contact with surfaces that have been handled by many people. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth until you have washed your hands. Some stores are providing hand sanitiser, and cleaning shopping trolleys and baskets between customers.Clearly there will be exceptions: for example, single parents with small children who cannot be left at home, but where possible you should try to shop alone. That will reduce the number of people inside stores, making physical distancing easier to achieve. It also reduces the number of people in your household exposed to the outdoors. Remember: studies show that, on average, people can have coronavirus for five days before they develop any symptoms, and all that time they can be unwittingly spreading it.It is natural that people worried about potentially being stuck indoors self-isolating for 14 days want to stock up on supplies. However, panic-buying means there can be shortages of food and medical products for people who rely on them. And there are reports of increased food waste as people have stockpiled perishable goods that they could not possibly have consumed in time. If everybody buys only what they need, there will be enough for all.Many shops including supermarkets are setting aside certain hours of the week specifically for shopping to be carried out by key workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions that mean they are trying to shield themselves from exposure to the virus. Clearly, it is difficult to enforce this, but be considerate when you choose to visit the shops to avoid coming into contact with these groups.The fewer people on the streets and in shops, the less chance there is for people to pass on coronavirus. If you can get delivery services, this will reduce the amount of times you have to leave the house. This will help slow, and ease, the peak of infections in the population that politicians and scientists worry will overwhelm health services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.Let’s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. A study of its genetic sequence, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories.The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen’s team showed – like the Chinese before them –that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats.Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in “wet” markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can’t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin – or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host – occur?“Our study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,” says Andersen. “However, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.”Case closed then, and President Trump is right to call Sars-CoV-2 the “Chinese virus”. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago – since Chinese people’s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new – you have to include a number of other factors. “We can blame the object – the virus, the cultural practice – but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,” says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, as anthropologists Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris have documented, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming “wild” species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren’t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too – closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.It’s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. “There is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,” says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace’s 2016 book Big Farms Make Big Flu, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another – having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus’s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.In a paper published in 2018, Gilbert’s group reviewed historical “conversion events”, as they call them – when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.That doesn’t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu – H5N1 and H7N9 – have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, “nothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.”China is one of the world’s major exporters of poultry, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs ersified its holdings and moved into Chinese poultry farms. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn’t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: “Follow the money.”Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.Still, Worobey doesn’t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating – that’s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year – but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.It’s possible – though by no means certain – that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago – drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs – another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. A few years ago, Worobey suggested – controversially – that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it’s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans.Not everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, “most avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation”, and they don’t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds – especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now.And we’re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was first described in the US in the late 1980s, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. A 2015 study carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US – the largest global exporters of pigs – are also the largest exporters of swine flu.There have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been blocked by mainstream news organisations as “partly false”. But the claims are also partly true. Though the links they draw are too simplistic, the evidence is now strong that the way meat is produced – and not just in China – contributed to Covid-19.It is clear that to prevent or at least slow the emergence of new zoonoses, as Fearnley and Lynteris have argued, China’s wet markets will need to be better regulated. But we also need to look behind those markets, at how our food is produced globally.Though it may not feel like it now, Wallace says, we have been lucky with Sars-CoV-2. It appears to be far less lethal that either H7N9 – which kills around a third of those it infects – or H5N1, which kills even more. This gives us an opportunity, he says, to question our lifestyle choices – because chicken isn’t cheap if it costs a million lives – and vote for politicians who hold agribusiness to higher standards of ecological, social and epidemiological sustainability. “Hopefully,” he says, “this will change our notions about agricultural production, land use and conservation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e949786880b9169c7b5dafc92a549872563d17c/0_425_2846_1708/master/2846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb237f87d7f168ea89945eff9d8a67e","title":"man from sidcup runs marathon in his south east london garden coronavirus","story":"James Page, 36, did 873 laps and raised over £3,000 for Children With Cancer UK A man in south-east London ran a marathon in his garden to raise money for a cancer charity after the government said people should stay local for exercise.James Page, 36, from Sidcup, had been in training for an ultra-marathon in the Sahara desert, along with the London Marathon, but both were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Rather than letting his months of training go to waste, the pipe fitter did 873 laps of about 50 metres in his garden – clocking up more than 26 miles – in a gargantuan effort on Friday which has helped him beat his fundraising target for Children With Cancer UK.“It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be,” he told the . “In a weird way it was quite enjoyable.

During the 4 hour and 57 minute marathon, he regularly refuelled with water, electrolytes, nuts, gels and sweets, while switching direction every 20 minutes to protect his knees.“I wanted to go a bit quicker and get a personal best, but it’s hard to pick up speed as you’re running in such a small circle,” he said. “I’m not the fastest runner, but I had to keep it at a nice comfortable speed otherwise it would be tricky at the corners.”Both of Page’s parents were diagnosed with cancer in the past 18 months and though they both appear to have beaten the disease, the road to recovery is an ordeal he would not want anyone else to go through.“My mum got the all clear on the same day my dad got diagnosed with bowel cancer,” he said. “Mum has to be really careful now, and my dad’s doing really good now, he’s got over the worst of it.”Page’s son created a toilet-roll finish line for his father, which has been the source of some jovial criticism online due to shortages, while his wife is not pleased about the damage to the lawn.“You can really see the loops trodden into the grass,” he said. “My wife’s not really happy, but she knows it was for a good cause and it keeps me happy.”Children With Cancer UK is organising the Together as One run, which is due to take place on 26 April, the original day of the London Marathon.It is encouraging people to use their daily exercise to run wherever they can in the UK between 9.30am and 10.30am to raise money for childhood cancer research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddf0b96dbe7b89f20ed3815473d6d68cc45fc091/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de9a3264f59bbb9fb337cf361f08934","title":"passover seder night jewish festival food traditions","story":"For millions of Jews around the world, the most important religious festival of the year will have to be a pared-down affairLast April, Sam and Ruth Borin travelled 200 miles from their home in York to Kent, to mark the start of the Jewish festival of Pesach, or Passover, with the rabbi who had conducted their wedding. Friends and members of the rabbi’s extended family crowded round the table for the traditional Seder feast, served on the first night of the holiday.By tradition, the youngest person present starts the ritual by asking four questions, which are the cue for the maggid, the telling of the story of the Jews’ exodus from slavery in Egypt. Among the foods consumed over a long evening of eating, singing and reading aloud are dry matzo biscuits, vegetables dipped in salt water (to represent tears), and bitter herbs.This year, Passover will be rather different for the Borins and millions of other Jewish families. Instead of vast gatherings of family and friends, many Seder feasts will be held at tables for four, two or even one. “It will just be me and my wife this year,” said Sam Borin. “It will feel very weird, but it’s out of the question to invite people.”The Borins are self-isolating after Ruth developed a fever. Their quarantine will end a day or two before Passover begins on 8 April. “So we will have a chance to go to the supermarket to buy matzo.” They, along with others, accept that they may not be able to source traditional Passover foods such as gefilte fish and matzo ball soup.This year’s unusual circumstances have led the London Beth Din, or religious court, to issue a list of products not made under special supervision that Jews will be permitted to eat.The “kosher for Passover” label usually appears on many foodstuffs in Jewish groceries and delis, indicating that a product has met the strict requirements of the eight-day festival. Chametz – any product made from grains that have come into contact with water and been allowed to ferment – is forbidden.Rabbi Jeremy Conway, of the kashrut ision London Beth Din, said: “We are acutely aware of the pressures on iniduals and families, particularly on older, vulnerable and isolated members. We already know why this Seder night will be different from all other nights, and this Pesach unlike any other. The kashrut ision has been working overtime to support kosher shops and manufacturers, as well as to put together new guidelines just for this Pesach, for those without access to fully supervised products.“This list should be used when regular supervised products are not available, or for people who are older or in isolation, and unable to go shopping or have Pesach products delivered.”Other rabbinical organisations have issued Passover guidelines. An umbrella group in the US has urged Jews to cancel their travel plans. “Everyone must plan to celebrate Pesach where they are currently,” it said.Orthodox rabbis in Jerusalem have given special dispensation for people to use Zoom video conferencing on Seder night to connect with one another. However, families must turn on their device and open the Zoom app before sundown to comply with the prohibition on the use of electricity, computers and phones on holidays.The rabbis said this was “to remove the sadness from seniors and the elderly and to give them motivation to keep fighting”.Ben Rich, a member of the York Liberal Jewish Community, said: “The expectation is that you gather your family and anyone who hasn’t got anywhere to go. We typically have about 20 people, but this year our family is going to meet by Zoom.”Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism, will be streaming Seder to hundreds, although there will be only a handful at her table. “What’s happening right now is hard,” she said, “and there is a real fear of losing people. But Judaism is hard-wired for adaptation, and we will adapt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0abc4373e8da3f7c6425dbc75b022107d49daa1b/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee93bebc30783515f0357b15b6139ef","title":"popes blessing in empty st peters square watched by 11m on tv","story":"Hour-long address came as Italy said 969 people had died from Covid-19 in 24 hoursMore than 11 million people tuned in to watch Pope Francis deliver a blessing in an empty Saint Peter’s Square, television bosses have said, as the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said the EU risked losing its purpose.The pope’s blessing, Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world)is usually reserved for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, with thousands flocking to take part. Images of the cloudy sky and the glistening square on Saturday, with the pope, alone, praying upon a platform illuminated by the faint light of six candelabras, travelled the world over. “For weeks now it has been evening,” he said. “Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities it has taken over our lives.”“The pandemic has reminded us that we are all in the same boat,” he added. “The storm exposes our vulnerability and uncovers those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules.”“And now that we are in a stormy sea, we implore you: wake up, Lord!”The hour-long blessing, which started at 6pm on Friday, was punctuated by moments of dramatic silence with the pope, standing, intent on praying, behind the famous “Miraculous Crucifix”, a wooden cross kept in the Church of Saint Marcellus which, according to devout Roman Catholics, saved Rome from the plague in 1522.According to official data from the broadcasting groups Rai, Sky and TV2000, the event was viewed by more than 11 million people. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus emergency in Italy, the number of viewers of live broadcasts of the pope’s prayers has increased, in part because the government’s stringent measures to halt the spread of coronavirus include the cessation of all masses, funerals and weddings.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 28 March, more than 595,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 27,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 9,000 fatalities, and there have been over 5,000 deaths in Spain. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 130,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.On Friday, Italy recorded its single biggest leap in coronavirus deaths, announcing that 969 people had died from Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours.The country also became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching 86,498 cases. That included 66,414 current infections, up 4,401 from Thursday.Conte warned on Saturday that the European Union could lose its purpose if it failed to come up with a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock.Meeting via a video-link, Conte aired his grievances after the 27 EU leaders could not agree on an action plan during an argumentative six-hour video conference on Thursday and gave their finance ministers two more weeks to forge a policy that could please Italy and Spain.“If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people,” Conte told Saturday’s edition of the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper.“We are at a critical point in European history,” Conte added, “I represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.”Rome and Madrid want the EU to start issuing “corona bonds” - a form of common debt that governments sell on markets to raise money and address inidual economic needs. But nations such as Germany and the Netherlands are balking at the idea of joint debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66ad3f23f3f8e7bd607c7e46aa25dea6ba550d6a/0_148_2262_1357/master/2262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7623b00290f85e66b425d1ddf9624f6","title":"taliban refuses to talk to afghan governments negotiating team","story":"The militant group’s refusal represents a setback for US-brokered peace talksThe Taliban refused to begin talks with the Afghan government’s new negotiating team on Saturday, in a setback to the US-brokered peace process for one of the world’s longest-running conflicts.Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the militants could not talk to the 21-member team named on Thursday as it had not been constituted taking all parties into account. The team is headed by Masoom Stanekzai, an ex-security chief and supporter of president Ashraf Ghani, and includes politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members are women.“In order to reach true and lasting peace, the aforementioned team must be agreed upon by all effective Afghan sides so that it can represent all sides,” said Mujahid.The United States, which ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, signed a troop withdrawal deal with the group in February. But progress on moving to talks between the militants and the Afghan government has been delayed by a feud between Afghan politicians, and disagreement between the Taliban and the government over prisoner releases and a possible ceasefire.The spokeswoman for the Afghan ministry of peace affairs, Najia Anwari, said the Taliban’s stance was unjustified, as the negotiating team had been appointed after wide consultations among Afghan society.Ghani’s political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, has not confirmed whether he will support the delegation, which is potentially important given his camp’s strong influence in the north and west. Abdullah’s spokesman, Fraidoon Khwazoon, said that although the announced list was not final and there were “considerations that needed to be addressed”, it should not be rejected outright. “All sides including the Taliban should try not to lose the available opportunity for peace, by make illogical excuses. The Taliban should not lose the current opportunity.”The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo failed to mediate between Abdullah and Ghana to create an “inclusive” government during a visit to Kabul on Monday, and announced a $1bn cut in US aid to Afghanistan, which he said could be reversed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b10328539ad42f281a72ed6d7e1a2ed7cacb5a6/0_481_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b765210dce9b27cd936c07d8e2a3403b","title":"coronavirus live news cases in italy overtake china us infections pass 100000","story":"All non-essential workers in Spain ‘must stay at home’ and Trump considers New York quarantine.

We have made it our priority to stand with the Airbnb community to do what we can to help. By working together, we can ensure that frontline workers can find a free and convenient place to stay as they continue their critical work. We thank our doctors and nurses across the country from the bottom of our hearts and are grateful to hosts who have already opened their homes during these difficult times.The initiative builds on programmes already launched in Italy and France where Airbnb and local partners, including the French Government, announced that doctors, nurses, care-givers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access accommodation on Airbnb.Here’s an update of the top twenty countries for number of coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker:You can get the full list here.

Photograph: iStockThe first Aer Lingus flight to China to collect personal protective equipment for the Irish health service arrived in Beijing shortly before 8.30pm on Saturday, having left Dublin Airport earlier in the morning. On Saturday Minister for Health Simon Harris said the first of upwards of ten flights carring PPE, including surgical masks, gowns and eye shields for health service workers, would arrive into Dublin on an Aer Lingus flight from China on Sunday afternoon.Over €225 million had been spent on PPE - compared with €15 million in a normal year, he said. The HSE would begin distributing about €20 million worth of PPE from Sunday evening and up to ten further flights delivering more equipment were due between now and Wednesday, he said. It comes as stocks of personal protective equipment for healthcare staff tackling the Covid-19 outbreak are “beginning to run low”, according to the Health Service Executive. The HSE is currently seeking to redistribute stocks to sites with “particular shortages”, it said in a statement. “We are encouraging staff to use these resources appropriately at this stage of the crisis.”One group of doctors say they have procured €6,000 worth of PPE themselves after losing patience with the HSE’s efforts to supply the equipment.While the large shipment PPE is scheduled to arrive back in Dublin Airport on Sunday and be distributed in the succeeding days, but it remains unclear whether existing supplies will be sufficient to bridge the gap until then.This €28 million delivery is the first batch of a large contract which the HSE says will address any current shortages.The Chinese embassy in Ireland said on Friday the first Aer Lingus cargo flight carrying PPE was scheduled to leave Dublin on Saturday morning and was due to land back in Dublin Airport late on Sunday.“Sail safe! We have got your back,” the embassy tweeted. It had earlier said it has secured landing slots for the first 10 Aer Lingus flights needed to ferry the equipment back to Ireland.Sources say Defence Forces trucks will be used to distribute the consignment, starting on Sunday evening.The HSE in its statement said it was seeking to manage prudently current PPE supplies “in light of the global shortage of this essential equipment at a time of unprecedented demand”.Since February 1st, about €30 million had been invested in PPE stock, “which are now beginning to run low”. The HSE has been urging hospitals to “preserve” stock until new deliveries arrive. The health service is short of goggles but not of other equipment such as masks, according to HSE chief operating officer Dr Colm Henry. Dr Henry has told staff, in a memo seen by The , to conserve stock by reducing their risk to exposure, not using PPE when they can avoid exposure, substituting some items for others, extending the use of equipment and “reprocessed” PPE.Last week, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association wrote to the Minister for Health warning stocks of PPE were running out in some locations,“leaving frontline staff and their patients in extremely exposed positions”.Over €60 million has been spent so far this year on protective equipment in the fight against Covid-19, compared to a traditional yearly allocation of €15 million.On Thursday, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said he “fully appreciated” the concerns expressed about PPE supplies. He said he too was concerned about the issue, but “it’s a global battle for this”.The total spend on equipment this year will be over €230 million, he added.Earlier this week, a donation of equipment from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, including masks, testing kits and protective suits, arrived in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Restrctions on movement come into force after another 49 positive tests recordedNiall Murphy in hospital since last weekBishop announces bodies of the dead will be taken directly to the burial groundNorth introduces sweeping powers Local authorities to lead supports for people cocooningAer Lingus plane is first of at ten due to bring equipment back for State\u0026rsquos health serviceFurther 14 people die in Republic while 294 more cases reported bringing total to 2,415Motorcyclists travel across country to collect gloves and masks for St James\u0026rsquos HospitalFarmers, transport workers, journalists among those exempt from some travel restrictionsLocal authority to lead community support service for people cocooningShane Ross says people \u0026lsquoneed not worry\u0026rsquo but focus on abiding by coronavirus measures\u0026lsquoIs there anything to be said for setting the clocks forward to 2021,\u0026rsquo asks Colm TobinDrew Harris: \u0026lsquoWe will stop iniduals and be making sure their journey is essential\u0026rsquoEmergency call-out or delivery services allowed in certain restricted circumstancesOn a sunny Thursday in Salthill\u0026rsquos near-empty promenade, the mood is quiet and terseIf both parties agree, orders on visitation and maintenance can be alteredSupplier cites recent Italian law that domestic need take precedence over exportsGarda\u0026iacute, medics and Minister for Transport concerned at increase in road deathsSector to seek financial support as nine clusters of Covid-19 found in nursing homesTaoiseach introduces sweeping new measures on social and commercial activityGarda\u0026iacute to mount major show of force over weekend to ensure complianceStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213881.1585316147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus galwegians adjust to a new traffic free reality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Herron at Blackrock in Salthill, Galway. ‘You do feel the general anxiety. Personally, I feel I am dealing with it okay.’ Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyFor years, city planners fretted over how to solve Galway’s absurd traffic problem, one which sees\u0026nbspcars and trucks grinding slowly through narrow streets, before heading out to Salthill.Nobody thought of a pandemic. On Thursday, a day gorgeous and mild, no breeze and the sea green and glassy, the traffic that was about in Salthill skated freely on near-empty roads.The mood by the seaside is strange: just that little bit too quiet and terse and everyone careful in how they move. The promenade has always been a four-seasons refuge for locals: a gulp of salt air, a quick swim for the hardy.Michael Herron is one of those, not long out of the water. He sits sipping coffee and chatting to another Blackrock regular, who says the water is about seven degrees. They are on a stone-cut seat, several metres apart.“You do feel the general anxiety,” Herron says. “Personally, I feel I am dealing with it okay. For a lot of people who haven’t had those challenges, it can be tricky to know what you are feeling is anxiety.”He works as a physiotherapist. He stopped taking bookings the week before St Patrick’s Day, and closed up that week. He then called his landlord.“I told him what I needed, which was the rent suspended. And he agreed.”So far, the days have been okay. Last year, he attended a 10-day silent retreat.“I think that has stood me in good stead for all of this,” he laughs. Nearby, two women chat as they walk in tandem, two metres apart. They prefer not to give their names but stop to talk. “This is the scariest thing I have experienced,” one says.“Both of us are isolating. Keeping away from friends, family, supermarkets. Having our groceries delivered. As a precaution. If we go out, we are keeping the physical distance of six feet.“We are happy with the way the Government is doing it. We think they are on it. They put in the precautions early on,” she goes on, adding that she sees her grandchildren when they come to visit and play in the garden.Alien and counterintuitiveBut that’s it. She doesn’t go anywhere near them. It’s alien and counterintuitive, but absolutely vital. On their walks, they have noticed awareness increasing by the day.People are staying away from each other, being strict about distance. The prom is a kind of self-contained community. Regulars know one another from years of tramping up and down.“But this is stressful. Definitely, it is always on my mind.”On Shop Street, the pubs are closed and the narrow street empty of its usual flaneurs and party animals. The atmosphere is weird and disconcerting, as though the eternal weekend has finally quit. Honza Kucera is busking anyway. It’s what he does. He has stationed himself in his usual spot near Murphy’s, his guitar case open. There’s too much velvet and not enough coin on show.He’s originally from the Czech Republic. “The borders are closed but I reckon I could probably go back – if I had anywhere to go back to,” he says brightly.Down the street, a lonely piper plays, the only other music on the street.“It could be worse,” Kucera says. “There has been solidarity, you know. In the winter you hardly see anyone dropping coins because their hands are cold and everything. Now you see fewer people. But there are not so many buskers on the street. There is less competition and most people that you do see out, it is necessary for them to be out. But they are good.”He’s living in a tent at the moment. He came back to the city last year, but could not get enough money for a deposit. When the rains and storms are severe, he uses hostels. But they have shut since the virus.“The weather’s not so bad recently, anyway.” So he figures he might get out of the city for a while. “Go up the country. Roam the woods.” But for now, he might as well play music for the crowd not here. He checks the news bulletins “to see what else I shouldn’t be doing”. And he moves from busking straight back to his tent, resisting the temptation to call in on friends. “I am keeping the distance,” he shrugs. “Everyone is doing the same. I am not really scared, though. Some people say it is irresponsible to stay out and to be on the street and to play music. But I don’t feel that way, to be honest.”School bellsOn normal Thursdays, the heavy-duty gridlock on the fabled N17 would start just after the school bells rang across the city. Claregalway is one of those towns that featured prominently on the daily radio traffic reports, in the blissful yesterday when traffic was a huge problem. The town is ghostly quiet today. Jackie and Peadar Dolan are outside their cafe, Treat. They locked the doors almost two weeks ago but still call in to check the freezers and run an eye over things.“Just keeping a business alive is a cost,” Peadar says. Treat is a local success story: a small, friendly, informal breakfast and dinner cafe opened on the cusp of the recession and slowly expanded to a second cafe in Lackagh village and a catering business. The company employs 60 people, and the Dolans could read the warning signs in the faces of their customers and their staff well before the Government issued instructions to close.“It has been like a rollercoaster,” Jackie says.“We saw something coming and could feel it coming. People weren’t coming out. And then there was a sudden stop. And then my staff were becoming more fearful. And you took the decision that there wasn’t enough business to stay open and that you were putting yourself and the staff at risk.”They locked their doors on the Sunday before St Patrick’s Day. “Over this past two weeks, you couldn’t reflect because you were all over the place,” Peadar admits. “Your head is in a pure fog. It is only now we are starting to do that.”They are deeply saddened by this and know they did the right thing.“Getting it ourselves,” Peadar replies instantly when asked about his deepest fear in this whole crisis. They have read and heard enough to respect and fear it. So they will wait it out. The business has already survived several major hurdles.Destroyed by fireThree years in, the cafe was destroyed by a fire.“The local community really kicked in and helped us. We were in the midst of the recession and I think we worked for nothing for four years.”Then the new motorway opened and instantly caused a 30 per cent drop in passing trade. The new VAT rates hit them. “And we have floods in Claregalway too. So fire, floods . . . famine is the only thing we haven’t had. And we pretty much have that at the minute. We survived all of those things because of the local people coming in. And that is what we miss. We miss the chat here and people coming in.”Already, people have been asking Peadar about setting up the catering truck for takeaway coffees. He knows he could operate it within the rules, but is not sure that a demand exists.There is, however, a need for something communal, some sense of gathering. “But would it be the right thing?” Jackie asks. Doing the right thing has become paramount.Back in Salthill the swimmers come and go all afternoon. There’s plenty of space and the rocks and ing boards have never offered such a vital sense of escape.“It will be interesting to see what happens when there is a bit of weather,” Michael Herron says. He and his friend cross their fingers, hoping that the promenade will stay open during the crisis.Turning to his companion, he wonders about life after Covid-19. Will people be more wary? Will friends keep their distance? The older man laughs.“I’m not sure about that. Sure who could do without a hug or a handshake?”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214976.1585424259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government publishes list of essential services","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Waste collection is one of the services deemed essential by the Government during the coronavirus crisis. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has published a list of workers who provide an “essential service” and can therefore continue to go to work despite restrictions introduced on Friday night.Among the list of professions included are farmers, farm labourers, manufacturers of food and beverage products and construction workers involved in “essential health and related projects” relevant to the coronavirus crisis.It also includes transport workers, news publishers, hotels or essential accommodation providers, banking and financial service workers, healthcare, social care, community and voluntary workers and certain retail workers.However construction workers have been restricted to those involved in “essential health and related projects” relevant to the pandemic.The document, which was published on Saturday evening, lists specific examples of workers within the following industries:People have been told to stay at home in virtually all circumstances and all public and private gatherings have been banned for two weeks as part of the Government’s latest sweeping measures to tackle coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.The only exceptions to the stay-at-home rule is for travel to health, social care or other essential work, shopping for food and takeaways, medical appointments and for “vital family reasons” such as providing care.People will also be allowed take “brief, inidual” physical exercise within 2km of their home.The document says if you are not engaged in the provision of essential services, then “you are not permitted to travel to and from work until April 12th, 2020”.There will be a grace period until 6pm on Monday, March 30th, for people “who need to make necessary arrangements to wind down their activities in an orderly way”.“This should however be done in a way that minimises travel and personal interaction as much as possible,” the guidance document states.It says in “exceptional circumstances” it is accepted that some extra time will be needed for a wind down of activity or it may be necessary for a site to continue to operate “at a reduced level of activity” (eg in complex manufacturing processes or very large construction projects).“This guidance will be kept under ongoing review, and will be updated as required,” it adds.Employers have been told that they should refer to the guidance document to decide whether their organisation is providing an essential service but that it is not necessary to seek official authorisation.Workers should carry work identification or a letter from their employer indicating they are “an essential employee” as well as one other form of identification.The self-employed, farmers or agricultural workers and members of the clergy have been told to carry one form of identification with them at all times.The document says all organisations that provide essential services should have “business continuity and resilience plans” in place.“This should take account of the possibility that key workers or key facilities may be impacted by Covid-19.”In response to the publication, Danny McCoy, chief executive of employers’ group Ibec, said: “For essential business that continue to operate in this crisis, we support the workforce who are at the front line. For the shops and utilities, there is a wide array of businesses and factories essential to their supply chains. Their work, courage and service must be commended in these difficult circumstances.“It takes a varied, erse and complex set of businesses to ensure the essential running of public service as well as the provision of goods and services to households. Today’s list published by Government is reflective of this.”Administrative and support servicesWhere necessary to support other essential services:Public administration and defencePublic administration activities necessary to support essential services and provision of social protection benefits (including Civil Service and Local Government):Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214228.1585340579!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus oxygen equipment meant for ireland held back by italy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA patient with Covid-19 wears a transparent plastic helmet filled with oxygen at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy. Photograph: Fabio BucciarelliThe New York TimesCrucial medical supplies for Covid-19 patients in Ireland have been held back by a major supplier, citing restrictions on exports imposed by Italian authorities.This is despite a European Union deal to drop export bans on medical equipment within Europe earlier this month.The shipment is the first consignment in an order of 1,000 specially designed hoods, manufactured in Italy, which administer high-pressure oxygen to patients in a manner that reduces the risk of healthcare workers being exposed to the virus.A spokesman for the importing company, Orega Systems, said it had ordered the units from its Italian partner at the start of the month, but they had not arrived. The equipment is destined for hospitals around the country.A letter sent to Orega Systems by the Italian manufacturer, seen by The , states: “We regret to inform you that the Italian government has imposed restrictions on the export of ventilators, hoods, full face masks and other devices used for providing respiratory therapies.”“As these devices are considered essential products for treating those ill with the coronavirus, in this extraordinary emergency situation, manufacturers are obliged to supply the Italian hospitals and the Civil Protection Authority first.”Non-invasive ventilationThe exporting company cited a law introduced on February 28th during the Covid-19 outbreak by Italy, which states companies must give priority to orders by Italian civil authorities for medical equipment, and makes exports of key goods subject to approval.Dr Oisín O’Connell, a respiratory consultant in Bons Secours Hospital in Cork, said the hoods would enable non-invasive ventilation of patients with Covid-19. The machines detect difficulties in patients’ breathing and inject high-pressure oxygen into the hood. “For every breath, it gives you extra support. If you’re wrecked by this virus and you can barely take a breath, it will sense that and pump more in,” Dr O’Connell said. It has the added benefit of limiting the spread of virus breathed out.The machines are high-end units available only to hospitals, not for retail use.They are more flexible than ventilators, and can be deployed in a variety of hospital settings, meaning the treatment can be delivered in any room or corridor. They are significantly cheaper than ventilators, costing €2,500-€5,000 compared with up to €40,000, Dr O’Connell said. Italy passed laws last month stating that protective equipment, ventilators and ventilator parts can only be exported if authorised by Italian Civil Protection. Other EU states such as Germany later imposed restrictions also.Freedom of goodsThe European Commission appealed for countries to drop such bans, saying they were contrary to freedom of goods in the single market. On March 15th the commission imposed an EU-wide ban on exports of crucial medical goods to countries outside the EU and European Economic Area, in an attempt to persuade EU states to continue supplying to each other.But the blocking of supplies to Irish hospitals indicates this has failed to work.“Obviously the export of medical goods made in Italy, that the nation needs, evidently creates a conflict,” a spokesman for Italy’s Civil Protection said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was “aware of this case and is working to extend all possible assistance in resolving this issue”. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Italian embassy did not respond to a request for comment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214970.1585421687!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"driving and nct tests suspended as minister looks to extend validity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShane Ross and the Road Safety Authority RSA) confirmed on Saturday that the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), the National Car Testing Service (NCT), as well as the Commercial Vehicle Testing System are suspended until further notice.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeCoronavirus latest news: NHS chief warns public not to be complacent as death toll passes 1,000 in UK Drivers warned they face points on their licence after speed awareness courses cancelledMajor London museums should hold exhibitions on \u0026#39pressing\u0026#39 national issues, heritage chief saysBoris Johnson warns coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets betterCivil servants should be deployed to carry out coronavirus contact tracing, former health secretary saysBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullRAF helicopters will help transport health service staff and supplies across the country, says Defence SecretaryNew rotas drawn up to protect cabinet members from virusComment: Mass testing is the fastest route back to normal life Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being considered for clemency in Iran, her husband saysPrince Harry likely to be given diplomatic status in the United States to help him get a green card easily, expert claimsIllegal mirgants with coronavirus \u0026#39inevitably entering UK\u0026#39Exercise Cygnus uncovered: the pandemic warnings buried by the government   Exclusive: Ministers were warned that the NHS could not cope with a pandemic three years ago but \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 results were kept secretComment: Business leaders must do everything possible to keep the economy goingComment: Life in a virtual court under coronavirus: \u0026#39No standing up for the judge and pray the kids don\u0026#39t burst in\u0026#39Public confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s handling of coronavirus epidemic soars after lockdownCoronavirus: How far will surveillance go in the name of public health?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"just many us have actually had coronavirusfar official figures","story":"Amid the uniquely unsettling novelty the coronavirus epidemic has brought, one thing is more uncertain than any other: how many of us have, or have had, the virus?On Tuesday, for example, Italy\u0027s civil protection chief, Dr Angelo Borrelli, briefed reporters with the latest statistics: cases up 3,612 to 54,030. The problem was that, earlier in the day, he had suggested there might be as many as 600,000. Asked to account for the difference, he said his earlier answer had taken into account asymptomatic cases. So what is it? 54,000 or 600,000?Italy is not alone. Earlier this week, the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo published a report into the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in February with more than 800 of the 3,711 people on board eventually diagnosed with Covid-19. According to the report, cited by the Japan Times, four-fifths of those infected showed no symptoms or just mild symptoms. Scans showed their lungs had suffered some physical consequences from the virus, but the patients had not been led by their symptoms to believe they were infected. Quite the reverse.Even in China, the poster child for lockdown and trace tactics which is edging back towards business as usual, there is uncertainty about asymptomatic cases. Estimates are classified. Officials insist all asymptomatic cases are unearthed by so-called contact tracing, yet even if this is true and every such case is detected, the numbers are not trivial: the South China Morning Post obtained details which suggested some 40,000 asymptomatic cases had been discovered in this way. It\u0027s hard not to believe there are many more. One way or another, it is clear that far more of us have, or have had, Covid-19, than the official figures tell us. But how many more? Only mass testing will give us a real picture of what is happening, and thus needs to happen at a far greater rate in the UK than is currently the case:Without mass testing, two very different pictures of the spread of the virus are emerging. On the one hand, there is the optimistic scenario, suggested by an Oxford paper which on Wednesday gained a huge amount of attention for a model suggesting that, given the current state of the UK outbreak, some 68 per cent of the population would have been infected by 19032020 – some 45 million of us, by last week, most presumably without even knowing it.Such a result would be dramatic. The outbreak is overblown, it would confirm. Most of us have already had the disease and are now fine. The NHS has survived the epidemic without even knowing it. But that was just one paper. There is another scenario. This one is that yes, there are lots of asymptomatic carriers (though far from 45 million), but rather than being beacons of hope and joy, they represent hidden problems – mines sown among the rest of us, ready to explode and cause a new outbreak just when it appears we might be on top of this one. According to researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (in a paper awaiting peer review), children may represent such mines because only around 20 per cent of them develop clinical symptoms (as opposed to 70 per cent in older adults). Yet it is not yet clear how infectious such largely asymptomatic people are. This critical question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control Covid-19 epidemics, the authors note.Such infection is certainly possible. In Wuhan on Tuesday, the one new case was that of a doctor reportedly infected by an asymptomatic patient. And on the Diamond Princess, studies suggest some of the 20 per cent of infected passengers who  suffered serious symptoms either went several days without obvious outward signs of the condition or caught it from those who never went on to develop serious symptoms.So is the epidemic mostly over or every bit as bad as we think, with the potential to erupt when we imagine we\u0027re through the worst? A single truth emerges: we will only discover the genuine picture through mass blood testing – a simple finger-prick tests that works like this:The testing must be followed, once the outbreak (whatever its true size) is controlled, by picking representative samples in the population to screen regularly, just as such samples are quizzed by pollsters to get a more or less accurate snapshot of national voting intention.In the middle of a mass global outbreak, it seems impossible to carry out whole population testing. Yet fate has twice thrown up unusual circumstances in which this has happened. The Diamond Princess was one such. The other was the 3,000-strong town of Vo, in Italy, where the entire population was tested after one of its citizens became the first to die of the disease.There, too, researchers found a significant proportion of the population (three per cent) had been infected without knowing it, representing the vast bulk of the 89 cases discovered. More generally, in the researchers\u0027 estimation, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 per cent of all virus-infected people.There is good news in this: mass testing in Vo meant there were no further deaths. And factoring in asymptomatic cases also dramatically lowers the disease\u0027s mortality rate, which is currently based only on those who receive tests – usually those showing obvious or severe symptoms. And finally, if you had a fever or a hacking cough earlier in the year and, looking back, now swear you must have had Covid-19 – well, you might just be right.

Indeed, it appears to have acted far quicker to this outbreak than to its own – had that been the other way round, Europe\u0027s outbreak might not be so catastrophic. Yet despite the offers of help, gratefully received in some quarters, others have been far more sceptical about Beijing\u0027s motives. Many suspect they amount to a form of whitewashing – an effort to distract from initial failings and shift the focus away from who bears responsibility for the rampage of the virus through continents.Across Europe, hearts are hardening to China\u0027s offers, and their efforts to change the narrative may be about to backfire spectacularly.A crime against humanity is how the Italian opposition politician Matteo Salvini described China\u0027s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, in a statement that will have struck a nerve in the country that has been worst affected.Salvini has form in criticism of Beijing, having spoken out often about what he called the colonisation of Italy as the Five Star Movement, his former coalition government partners, cosied up to China as part of a €2.5 billion deal under the Belt and Road Initiative.He has been critical of Chinese businesses investing in Italy, buying up factories once staffed by Italians and importing Chinese migrant workers in order to exploit the prestige of the Made in Italy label on goods such as textiles while keeping costs down. He has also been outspoken on the need for Italians\u0027 data, from banking information to mobile phones, to be kept in Italian hands, warning against allowing companies such as Huawei into the country and echoing the views of the US President, Donald Trump.Now, amid this outbreak, Salvini is using language sure to grip a public that has been slowly turning to the political right for years amid falling employment and a corrupt, failing bureaucratic system.China, of course, has been damned by much of the West for the way it treats its citizens, from human rights outrages in Xinjiang against the Uigher community to its new system of social credit. And that is before mentioning Tibet.Members of the Uighur community and sympathisers demonstrate against the Chinese government in Amsterdam in DecemberHuman rights is a phrase never far from the lips of those who criticise China. Now – amid an outbreak which many blame Beijing for not dealing with adequately at best, and facilitating through dishonesty at worst – the nightmare picture Salvini is painting for the Italian public is clear: China\u0027s crimes are not limited to its own people but will be visited upon you, too.Trump has for a long time demonised China, but the view that the world\u0027s second-largest economy is the danger he has depicted has yet to take hold of Europe in the way that fear of Russia, say, or Islamist extremism, has. That could be about to change.Salvini was already popular in Italy – at around 30 per cent, his party, the Lega, is more than twice as popular as the Five Star. Another party, the far-right Fratelli d\u0027Italia, has been steadily rising in the polls since well before the outbreak of Covi-19, and this is a further example of the direction in which the country is heading.One suspects that, when this dreadful episode is finally over, the Lega and the FdI will be the big winners politically from going after China and accusing it of being the party responsible  for the deaths of tens of thousands of Italians.Matteo Salvini after a meeting with Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, at the Chigi Palace It will also, one thinks, be crippling for Five Star after its close history with Beijing, but also for other left-wing parties, who for decades have preached globalism as the answer to ailing Italy\u0027s problems. It will be extremely difficult to continue to make that argument to a nation as badly stung as this, no matter how good it may be.But what must also be on the table now is how other countries will respond. Anti-Chinese sentiment has existed in Italy for a long time, for a number of reasons unique to the peninsula. But how will Spain, for example, with its equally horrific toll, or France, edging ever close to the Front National, respond?Despite China\u0027s rush to provide EU countries with aid, reports have already emerged from both Spain and the Czech Republic that the hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests Beijing has delivered are not fit for purpose. That will do little to help China\u0027s already battered image. Europe\u0027s relationship with China was already set to be the major talking point, beside Brexit, for the next few years. If the likes of Salvini get their way, coronavirus may be the thing that tips the continent from scepticism to outright hostility.What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeCoronavirus latest news: NHS chief warns public not to be complacent as death toll passes 1,000 in UK Drivers warned they face points on their licence after speed awareness courses cancelledMajor London museums should hold exhibitions on \u0026#39pressing\u0026#39 national issues, heritage chief saysBoris Johnson warns coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets betterCivil servants should be deployed to carry out coronavirus contact tracing, former health secretary saysBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullRAF helicopters will help transport health service staff and supplies across the country, says Defence SecretaryNew rotas drawn up to protect cabinet members from virusComment: Mass testing is the fastest route back to normal life Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being considered for clemency in Iran, her husband saysPrince Harry likely to be given diplomatic status in the United States to help him get a green card easily, expert claimsIllegal mirgants with coronavirus \u0026#39inevitably entering UK\u0026#39Exercise Cygnus uncovered: the pandemic warnings buried by the government   Exclusive: Ministers were warned that the NHS could not cope with a pandemic three years ago but \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 results were kept secretComment: Business leaders must do everything possible to keep the economy goingComment: Life in a virtual court under coronavirus: \u0026#39No standing up for the judge and pray the kids don\u0026#39t burst in\u0026#39Public confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s handling of coronavirus epidemic soars after lockdownCoronavirus: How far will surveillance go in the name of public health?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church england launches first lgbti chaplaincy service make","story":"The Church of England’s first LGBTI chaplaincy service has been launched in a bid to make Christianity a “safe space for everyone”.The chaplaincy service, based in the Diocese of Oxford, features eight voluntary chaplains offering support to members of the LGBTI community in the form of a cup of coffee, a walk, or just someone to confide in so as to “ serve people who have not been well-served by the church”.The scheme, backed by the Bishop of Oxford, was launched two months ago and also offers special monthly services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender congregants at Christchurch Cathedral. Yet since the Coronavirus pandemic took hold, these services are now offered in podcast form so that people can take part virtually. The chaplaincy service - which volunteers claim provides a “lifeline” for some congregants - marks the first scheme of its kind and its pioneers hope that it will be rolled out across the Church of England’s 41 other dioceses. It also comes at a time when isions within the Anglican church about how it deals with LGBT issues have come to a head. Many LGBT Christians say they have been made to feel unwelcome and ostracised within the Church of England, which has embarked on a study of human sexuality, called ‘Living in Love and Faith’, due to be completed later this year.Rev Marcus Green, rector of three rural parishes in North Oxfordshire and part of the oversight group for the new chaplaincy. He told The : “This service is an alternative place for people to come talk, be respected and be listened to. It’s a safe space. “We have sought to get eight chaplains with varying life experience, a we’re very aware of the current issues. For example, I’m a gay man and a priest in a church. And I would say that my experience is that there are times when the church has not been great with LGBTI people. “I think every church hopes that it’s great but sometimes that hope is not the reality of LGBTI people and so we want the church to be a safe place for everyone. “This chaplaincy is there because sometimes people have gone and not felt welcomed or respected. So as a diocese, we are putting something on to say we are here for you.”Rev Green said that other dioceses have previously had a volunteer chaplain helping LGBT people, but this is the first designated LGBT chaplaincy service in the UK, with a stronghold of eight volunteers offering pastoral support.“This is not a job for one person,” he added. “If you have a chaplain in Banbury and a gay perosn in Slough, what’s the use in that? We want volunteers across the diocese. Other dioceses are now getting in touch and asking us how it’s going, so we’re hoping our model will be replicated and rolled out.”The chaplaincy service held the first of its monthly LGBTI+ services at Christchurch Cathedral in Oxford, and had hoped for 40 congregants, but 100 showed up. Following the national lockdown, one of their new  LGBTI+ chaplains hosted the March service via podcast and assumed the role of preacher.Ross Meikle, one of the volunteer chaplains, said that the chaplaincy service has been “well-received and warmly appreciated” by those he and his colleagues have supported, and has even provided a “lifeline” to vulnerable congregants.“As a chaplain, I’ve been able to be in touch with a couple of people who have found it really helpful but especially in rural areas where the LGBT presence is less visible or in cases where people feel less comfortable talking to their vicars.“But now they know there’s a safe space for them where they know that they will be heard and respected, loved and cared for in that process. “For one of the people I have been in touch with, primarily over email, for him it’s been a lifeline. For some people, faith is something they have to work at and it doesn\u0027t feel as if God is there but knowing there are people he can turn to and email, as is the case for many LGBT people, is so important. “We’re not their counsellors or therapists. We’re there to make sure these people know they are loved. It’s the first one of its kids. This has been a really important and valuable step for a diocese to make.”   The Rt Revd Dr Steven Croft, the Bishop of Oxford, said that staff across the diocese are “committed to providing the highest standard of pastoral care to Christians”.   “Our trained volunteer chaplains are all set to listen and offer support to LGBTI+ people, their families and friends. It’s the first of its kind, and we hope it will be replicated in other dioceses. We also hope that it will give us a brand new opportunity to learn from the insights of LGBTI+ people about being church together.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"business leaders must do everything possible keep economy going","story":"Big businesses deserve our thanks and applause for their work helping during this national emergencyI joined the nation in clapping for NHS staff on Thursday night. No amount of gratitude is too much for those who are in the front line of caring for us all, working long and anti-social hours and having to make life and death choices. It was a wonderful demonstration of the whole community coming together in difficult times. But let us also give a metaphorical clap too to all those businesses and the self-employed who, while complying with the requisite two metre rule, have stayed open to keep the lights of the economy on and to maintain vital aspects of life for the fortunate 99 per cent of households who are not expected to end up hospitalised by this new virus.In an age where as many as two thirds of people do not know the name of their neighbour, we forget at our peril that the window cleaner or the gardener who visits weekly to cut the grass are often serving as invisible social workers, the first to notice when they don’t get the usual cheery wave. And just as for the whole economy, the NHS “chain” is only as strong as its weakest link – whether that is the security guard on reception, the catering company serving its canteen, the van driver delivering supplies or the electricity company providing energy.Indeed, in an era of complex, interconnected supply chains, the roles of warehouse staff, the postmen and women, farmers, garage mechanics, take-away owners, telecoms engineers, bank loan processors and all those working in supermarkets, factories and food processing companies are equally vital.Far from such firms being shamed for remaining open as some on the Left have chosen to advocate, they too deserve our thanks and applause for their work helping during this national emergency.Some large firms may have already over-reacted and actually undermined the national effort at this time. The drive-through McDonald’s in my constituency was one of few such facilities in rural West Sussex, full of blue-light workers day and night who were grateful for a freshly made coffee, a clean WC and a hot bite to eat on the way to or from their shift.Where are all those essential workers supposed to go now? The economy – not to mention our children’s generation – will thank business leaders for not over-reacting. Export markets founded on historical ties and trading patterns once lost may never return again. Those Asian economies that never shut down to the extent that we already have are awakening and more than happy to plug the gaps left when the phone at a UK supplier sits ringing unanswered.The unprecedented measures – and level of expenditure – that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has now put in place are the most comprehensive anywhere in the world. With this sort of support, business and the self-employed now have greater certainty and a valuable safety net. In return, let’s maintain cool heads and keep the economy open for business.Andrew Griffith is the former Chief Operating Officer \u0026amp CFO of Sky, was the Prime Minister’s Chief Business Adviser until December 2019 and is Conservative MP for Arundel \u0026amp South DownsWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeCoronavirus latest news: NHS chief warns public not to be complacent as death toll passes 1,000 in UK Drivers warned they face points on their licence after speed awareness courses cancelledBoris Johnson warns coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets betterBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullCivil servants should be deployed to carry out coronavirus contact tracing, former health secretary saysMajor London museums should hold exhibitions on \u0026#39pressing\u0026#39 national issues, heritage chief saysRAF helicopters will help transport health service staff and supplies across the country, says Defence SecretaryNew rotas drawn up to protect cabinet members from virusComment: Mass testing is the fastest route back to normal life Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being considered for clemency in Iran, her husband saysPrince Harry likely to be given diplomatic status in the United States to help him get a green card easily, expert claimsIllegal mirgants with coronavirus \u0026#39inevitably entering UK\u0026#39Exercise Cygnus uncovered: the pandemic warnings buried by the government   Exclusive: Ministers were warned that the NHS could not cope with a pandemic three years ago but \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 results were kept secretComment: Life in a virtual court under coronavirus: \u0026#39No standing up for the judge and pray the kids don\u0026#39t burst in\u0026#39Public confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s handling of coronavirus epidemic soars after lockdownCoronavirus: How far will surveillance go in the name of public health?Oscar Wilde\u0026#39s early death was predicted by a fortune teller and the writer agreed he had fulfilled his ‘destiny’, new documents revealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joseph lowery civil rights leader campaigned alongside martin","story":"Joseph Lowery, a veteran civil rights leader who helped Martin Luther King Jr. found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and fought against racial discrimination, died on Friday, a family statement said. He was 98.A charismatic and fiery preacher, Lowery led the SCLC for two decades  restoring the organisation\u0027s financial stability and pressuring businesses not to trade with South Africa\u0027s apartheid-era regime - before retiring in 1997.Lowery, considered the dean of civil rights veterans, lived to celebrate a November 2008 milestone that few of his movement colleagues thought they would ever witness - the election of an African-American president.At an emotional victory celebration for President-elect Barack Obama in Atlanta, Lowery said, America tonight is in the process of being born again.An early and enthusiastic supporter of Obama over his opponent Hillary Clinton, Lowery also gave the benediction at Obama\u0027s inauguration.We thank you for the empowering of thy servant, our 44th president, to inspire our nation to believe that, yes, we can work together to achieve a more perfect union, he said.In 2009, Obama awarded Lowery the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u0027s highest civilian honor.In another high-profile moment, Lowery drew a standing ovation at the 2006 funeral of King\u0027s widow, Coretta Scott King, when he criticised the war in Iraq, saying: For war, billions more, but no more for the poor. The comment also drew head shakes from then-President George Bush and his father, former president George HW Bush, who were seated behind the pulpit.Lowery\u0027s involvement in civil rights grew naturally out of his Christian faith. He often preached that racial discrimination in housing, employment and health care was at odds with fundamental Christian values such as human worth and the brotherhood of man.I\u0027ve never felt your ministry should be totally devoted to making a heavenly home. I thought it should also be devoted to making your home here heavenly, he once said.Lowery remained active in fighting issues such as war, poverty and racism long after retiring, and survived prostate cancer and throat surgery after he beat Jim Crow.His wife, Evelyn Gibson Lowery, who worked alongside her husband of nearly 70 years and served as head of SCLCWOMEN, died in 2013.I\u0027ll miss you, Uncle Joe. You finally made it up to see Aunt Evelyn again, King\u0027s daughter, Bernice King, said in a tweet Friday night.Lowery was pastor of the Warren Street Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, in the 1950s when he met King, who then lived in Montgomery, Alabama. Lowery\u0027s meetings with King, the Rev Ralph David Abernathy and other civil rights activists led to the SCLC\u0027s formation in 1957. The group became a leading force in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.Lowery became SCLC president in 1977 following the resignation of Abernathy, who had taken the job after King was assassinated in 1968. He took over an SCLC that was deeply in debt and losing members rapidly. Lowery helped the organisation survive and guided it on a new course that embraced more mainstream social and economic policies.Coretta Scott King once said Lowery has led more marches and been in the trenches more than anyone since Martin.He was arrested in 1983 in North Carolina for protesting the dumping of toxic wastes in a predominantly black county and in 1984 in Washington while demonstrating against apartheid.He recalled a 1979 confrontation in Decatur, Alabama, when he and others were protesting the case of a mentally disabled black man charged with rape. He recalled that bullets whizzed inches above their heads and a group of Klan members confronted them.I could hear them go \u0027whoosh,\u0027 Lowery said. I\u0027ll never forget that. I almost died 24 miles from where I was born.In the mid-1980s, he led a boycott that persuaded the Winn-Dixie grocery chain to stop selling South African canned fruit and frozen fish when that nation was in the grip of apartheid.He also continued to urge blacks to exercise their hard-won rights by registering to vote.Black people need to understand that the right to vote was not a gift of our political system but came as a result of blood, sweat and tears, he said in 1985.Like King, Lowery juggled his civil rights work with ministry. He pastored United Methodist churches in Atlanta for decades and continued preaching long after retiring.Born in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1921, Joseph Echols Lowery grew up in a Methodist church where his great-grandfather, the Rev Howard Echols, was the first black pastor. Lowery\u0027s father, a grocery store owner, often protested racism in the community.After college, Lowery edited a newspaper and taught school in Birmingham, but the idea of becoming a minister just kept gnawing and gnawing at me, he said. After marrying Evelyn Gibson, a Methodist preacher\u0027s daughter, he began his first pastorate in Birmingham in 1948.In a 1998 interview, Lowery said he was optimistic that true racial equality would one day be achieved.I believe in the final triumph of righteousness, he said. The Bible says weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.He died at home in Atlanta from natural causes unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak, the family statement said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass testing fastest route back normal life","story":"What is the exit route from the Coronavirus paralysis? We are told the peak will be in about three weeks. But we are also told that until we have a vaccine, thought to be over a year away, the virus will come back in wave after wave. Normal life seems a long way off. But normal life is much closer in countries that have embraced the advice of World Health Organisation Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom to “test test test”.The restaurants are open in South Korea. You can go shopping in Taiwan. Offices are open in Singapore. These countries learned the hard way how to deal with a pandemic after the deadly SARS virus. They now show us how we can emerge from lockdown.Testing provides clarity. Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don’t, vital services continue to function. In most of those countries restaurants, malls and office blocks require you to walk through a temperature checker before you enter. They all check international visitors the same way and are astonished we don’t do the same at Heathrow.The immediate priority is to protect the NHS and ramp up its capacity. Beds, equipment, and ventilators  are all vital, but as every health secretary learns fairly quickly, the true capacity of the NHS lies in its staff.They are the heroes we need to protect – and make sure they can get back to work as quickly as possible if a member of their household has symptoms. Around 10 per cent of the population have a cough or fever at this time of year, taking thousands of NHS workers off the frontline. The government’s commitment to accelerate testing for NHS staff is therefore absolutely right.But as new tests come on stream we need to go further. Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, told the Select Committee which I chair on Thursday that the virus can incubate for three to five days before any symptoms. Those are days when doctors and nurses could be infecting their own patients. We need weekly tests for all NHS and care home staff to remove that worry.As we tool up to do this, you begin to see how mass testing can also show us the way out of this crisis. Social distancing works because it drastically reduces the opportunity for transmission. What was previously an exponential growth in transmission becomes much slower as the curve is flattened. But this only works for as long as it’s in place, and it can’t remain in place forever. But with mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission.Of course, with many other countries thinking the same way, there is no magic wand that will suddenly overcome shortages in testing supply chains. The solution is to look to British scientists and manufacturers to put in place tests and the infrastructure we need to process them. Just as we are rising to the challenge with ventilators, we need urgently to do the same for testing.If we do so, the opportunities are clear. South Korea has tested five times more people per head of population than us – and are reaping the rewards with their new cases now on a downward trend – despite being nearer to China. They are reporting fewer than ten deaths every day.Closer to home, Germany is leading the way. Two weeks ago they had carried out 167,000 tests, four times more than us. As a result they have identified three times more cases than us – but with fewer than half the number of deaths we have had. There may be differences in reporting, but fundamentally, finding Covid-19 patients earlier means you can get the most vulnerable ones hospital care more quickly. In Germany they are even taking in patients from France and Italy.We should be under no illusion that the contact tracing that goes alongside testing is resource intensive. Every time somebody tests positive, they need a dedicated contact tracer who works through all their previous interactions to make sure every single one is isolated until they are tested as Covid-free. Why not allocate all the local government officials in planning departments and the civil servants on non-Covid duties to this task?And as Europe’s tech hub, we should use our skills there, too. In Singapore everyone has been asked to use the TraceTogether App. When you come near someone else with the app it swaps anonymous ID data which is stored in your phone. If you contract the virus, everyone you have been near can be contacted.Singapore has had just two deaths. It is encrypted and all data destroyed after 21 days. Those worried about the civil liberties implications might reflect that Singaporeans have had their liberties curtailed far less than countries which have had to go into full lockdown.Mass social distancing should protect the NHS through the peak over the next few weeks, but it’s a blunt instrument with massive economic impact. For the next wave we must use the precision scalpel of mass testing.Coronavirus latest news: NHS chief warns public not to be complacent as death toll passes 1,000 in UK What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeDrivers warned they face points on their licence after speed awareness courses cancelledMajor London museums should hold exhibitions on \u0026#39pressing\u0026#39 national issues, heritage chief saysBoris Johnson warns coronavirus crisis will get worse before it gets betterCivil servants should be deployed to carry out coronavirus contact tracing, former health secretary saysBoris Johnson\u0026#39s letter to the nation on Coronavirus in fullRAF helicopters will help transport health service staff and supplies across the country, says Defence SecretaryNew rotas drawn up to protect cabinet members from virusNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being considered for clemency in Iran, her husband saysPrince Harry likely to be given diplomatic status in the United States to help him get a green card easily, expert claimsIllegal mirgants with coronavirus \u0026#39inevitably entering UK\u0026#39Exercise Cygnus uncovered: the pandemic warnings buried by the government   Exclusive: Ministers were warned that the NHS could not cope with a pandemic three years ago but \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 results were kept secretComment: Business leaders must do everything possible to keep the economy goingComment: Life in a virtual court under coronavirus: \u0026#39No standing up for the judge and pray the kids don\u0026#39t burst in\u0026#39Public confidence in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s handling of coronavirus epidemic soars after lockdownCoronavirus: How far will surveillance go in the name of public health?Oscar Wilde\u0026#39s early death was predicted by a fortune teller and the writer agreed he had fulfilled his ‘destiny’, new documents revealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/27/TELEMMGLPICT000227843106_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"unprecedented curtailment freedom must end soon possible","story":"The indirect costs of the country\u0026#39s closures are hard to assess, but will surely be gargantuanA decade of painstaking fiscal repair-work was undone within the first few hours and that was just the start. The direct cost of Britain’s stimulus package is £70 billion which, as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, confirmed on Friday, is considerably higher than in other countries.The indirect costs are harder to assess, but will surely be gargantuan. The first nine days of the crisis pushed half a million more people onto the dole, wiping out five years of rising employment. With every day that our shops remain shut, the benefits bill will rise – just as tax revenues dry up.I don’t think we yet understand how vast a hit we are taking. It has become commonplace to compare the coronavirus to the Second World War, but our domestic economy continued to function even at the height of the Blitz. Shops, pubs and schools stayed open, and cinemas were closed for only two weeks.We also had full employment: in 1943, 76 per cent of working-age people had jobs, a peak not reached again until 2018. Even so, the debts we took on during the war were a drag on our economy for decades. As this column noted last week, the final instalment of our loan from the United States was not repaid until 2006.This time, the damage is more concentrated. Every hour that these closures remain in force is adding months to our eventual recovery. My three-year-old, who is playing obliviously at my feet as I type these words, will be working off the debt for the rest of his life.Vaccine for CoronavirusAt the same time, we are curtailing freedom of contract, of movement, of worship, of assembly, of ownership – restrictions which, three weeks ago, were utterly unthinkable.If the opinion polls are to be believed, 90 per cent of us support the clampdown. It is worth dwelling, for a moment, on that figure. Obviously, we should be prepared to mothball the economy if that is the only way to save hundreds of thousands of lives. But is it? No one really knows.Michael Levitt, a Stanford biophysicist and Nobel Prize winner, correctly forecast the course of the outbreak in China by analysing the acceleration rather than the number of fatalities. Applying the same method, he now thinks that the outbreak is peaking elsewhere.An Oxford University study suggests that the infections began much earlier than is currently supposed, and that many of us – possibly most of us – have already had the bug, either mildly or asymptomatically.Obviously, we can’t yet say whether either of these hypotheses is correct. The number of high-profile people who have experienced only slight symptoms – including the Prime Minster, the Health Secretary and the Prince of Wales – anecdotally supports the notion that the virus is widespread.The authors of the Imperial College report that suggested 250,000 deaths now say that the fatalities will be around 5,700 – less than a year of winter flu. But none of this amounts to proof, and we can hardly blame ministers for erring on the side of caution.Boris Johnson is breaking all records for popularity. Seventy-two per cent of us like the way he is handling things. Small-government types give him the benefit of the doubt. Jeremy Corbyn, they know, would be using the crisis to impose state control for its own sake. Theresa May would be indulging her authoritarian streak. But everyone can see that the Prime Minister imposed these restrictions only as a last resort.When Steve Baker, the most libertarian MP in the Commons, read out some of the emergency powers being granted to the Government, his voice kept cracking but, even Steve conceded, that such powers were needed in the very short term.Among statists, there is no such ambiguity. They were calling for the shutdown long before it was imposed. People who crave the smack of firm Government become more numerous at times like this. Fear changes our brain chemistry. We become warier and less tolerant of dissent. Never mind the police in Derbyshire and their idiotic filming of solitary Peak District walkers. Far nastier, in my book, is the website established by Humberside cops inviting people to snitch on neighbours who venture outside too often. Yet, instead of chiding our chief constables for their pettiness, our tabloids are demanding greater police powers – as well as rationing and price controls.Social Distancing - Why it is CrucialMinisters understand that they will be judged by the number of coronavirus fatalities – even if reducing that number pushes up the mortality rate elsewhere. Longevity correlates with wealth and, as resources are misallocated, there will be more needless deaths. One study suggests that, if the economy shrinks by more than 6.4 per cent, Britain will suffer more fatalities than are caused by the virus itself.But no one will blame the Government for unidentifiable losses. It is a version of what the nineteenth-century economist Frédéric Bastiat called “the seen and the unseen”. And so, whatever the rights and wrongs of the lockdown, there will be pressure to keep it in place for longer than is justified by the science.“You can’t be too careful,” we will be told. “Let’s leave things as they are until we are absolutely sure. After all, lives are worth more than money.” But this isn’t about lives versus money it’s about lives versus lives.A total shutdown is literally lethal. Loosening the restrictions as soon as possible is not just a question of freedom or of economic growth it is a question of basic welfare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith a picking season that starts in early May, soft fruit farmers are at the sharp end of a potential coronavirus labour shortage.Most of East Scryne\u0027s pickers would normally arrive at the end of April to start picking raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries - the fruit that\u0027s often seen as the quintessential symbol of British summer.\u0026nbspGovernment adviser under fire for saying UK farming sector not neededBrexit is an chance to showcase Britain’s farmingStrawberry, white chocolate and pistachio choux bunsFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryHeartbreaking photo of elderly man by empty supermarket shelvesWe\u0027re concerned that we won\u0027t be able to bring those people over and we have to look at alternatives, says Porter.The farmers\u0027 call to arms needs to be answered soon if we are to avoid a supply shortage that would trigger higher prices. If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But those are the headlines the difference lies in the details.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Employees (and employers) will have to wait until the end of April to get their money. For the self-employed, there’s no prospect of the cash coming in until “the beginning of June”.That’s a yawning gap of time for someone to go without income.Why the longer wait? Because the Treasury will have to establish an entirely new scheme to process claims from the self-employed.Officials will have to look at three years of declared self-employment tax returns so they can decide what the appropriate replacement income is for that worker, based on their average earnings.What of those who have only filed returns for one year or two? Officials will, apparently, use their discretion to decide on the right amount of compensation.And those who haven’t yet filed any tax returns at all?The chancellor made it clear they will, unfortunately, have to fall back on the welfare system, albeit one that has been made more generous in recent weeks. For some, that will mean a serious drop in income.And those self-employed who need cash now? They can try to access small-business loans. Or, again, there’s the unemployment benefits system safety net.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ian Colbeck, professor of environmental science at the University of Essex, told The Independent that the reduction in global emissions will most likely be temporary.“Emissions tend to bounce back fairly quickly shortly after a crisis ends,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Expect to see short-term impacts on energy and emissions disappear as governments introduce stimulus packages to increase industrial output at the end of the pandemic. Following the global financial crash in 2008-09, carbon emissions increased by 5 per cent as a result of such stimulus.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative government has pledged to make the UK carbon-free by 2050.“We are spending money on almost every company in the country right now. What we should be doing is saying, ‘You can have this money but you need to be compliant with a zero-carbon future by 2050,’” Professor\u0026nbspSiegert said.According to Professor Siegert, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires trillions of pounds of investment. If it is all spent on managing the coronavirus outbreak, “we will not have the financial muscle to invest in a low-carbon future”, he said.Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), has also warned that the pandemic could stall global efforts to transition towards clean energy.“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world’s inescapable challenge,” he said in a\u0026nbspstatement.Wildflowers move north as Earth’s temperature continues to riseThe IEA has already predicted that global oil demand will sharply decrease in 2020, by 435,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, due to the pandemic.“The sharp decline in the oil market may well undermine clean energy transitions by reducing the impetus for energy efficiency policies,” Dr Birol said.Cheaper energy reduces the appeal of cleaner, more efficient cars, homes and offices, Dr Birol said, calling on governments to reduce subsidies for fossil fuels. Coronavirus is also likely to stall production of clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, while many parts of China are under lockdown.“Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,” Dr Birol said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

say.It means the UK must start from scratch in vetting hazardous chemicals itself – but with far less money and staff,\u0026nbspin a process expected to take many years.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the interim, manufacturers will be able to successfully challenge attempts to exclude chemicals banned in the EU – in everything from food and drink packaging and paints to furniture, carpets, clothing and even toys,\u0026nbspthe groups fear.“If we don’t have access to the safety data then the government could be challenged in the courts over decisions and it could lose,” warned Libby Peake, of the Green Alliance think tank.Boris Johnson trade deal plan ‘little better than no-deal Brexit’And Dr Michael Warhurst, executive director of Chem Trust campaigning charity, said: “We risk spending most of our time trying to instal a database with no data on it – and not having time to develop any new controls.”The controversy has blown up after Mr Johnson ditched Theresa May’s plan for “associate membership” of EU agencies, including the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and its database known as Reach.It would involve following all decisions on chemicals in Reach, without a vote, and oversight by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – which are both red lines to a prime minister pledging “no alignment”.In its aims for an EU trade deal, the UK is now arguing for “separate regulatory requirements” – which would rule out access to the database or the exchange of confidential business information.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye

Not as bad as you’d thinkWill the coronavirus crisis derail Brexit talks?Treasury Budget figures confirm there was no £350m a week from BrexitJohnson will forfeit your human rights to get his way with Brexit* Bisphenols – known to disrupt the body’s hormone system, some are banned from use in babies’ bottles and infant cups and, soon, from thermal paper till receipts. However, firms are starting to use other bisphenols “that raise similar concerns about toxicity”, the group says.* Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – used in non-stick pans, waterproof fabrics, food packaging and cosmetics, they have been linked to cancers, thyroid disease, obesity and reproductive problems, but only two of 4,000 chemicals in the group have been banned so far.* Phthalates – added to plastics to increase durability, they are found in furnishings, flooring, clothing, paint and some toys. With pregnant women and children most vulnerable – exposure in the womb has been linked to poor reproductive organ development in boys, early onset of female puberty, and delayed language development – they are partly restricted in the EU.* Flame retardants – added to sofas, mattresses, electronic products, carpeting, building materials and car seats to hinder the spread of fires, they build up in homes and the environment and some are known to be cancer causing. Many are banned, but – again – similar chemicals are now being used.The UK expects to spend £13m a year on its regulator, employing 35 to\u0026nbsp40 staff, but Reach boasts 589 staff and a budget topping €100m\u0026nbsp(£89m) – yet has still failed to vet all chemicals after more than a decade’s work.Dr Warhurst warned: “There is a big difference between being able, theoretically, to control chemicals and actually being able to do it, with much less data, fewer people – and perhaps under pressure from a US trade deal.“These chemical companies have a record of going to court when restrictions are imposed.”And Ms Peake added: “For two years at least after the transition period, we will no longer have access to the EU’s database and, therefore, access to the safety data.“During that period, there is a risk that companies will try to use chemicals in the UK that have been banned or restricted at an EU level, on the grounds that we don’t have the background safety data to justify a decision.”But a government spokesperson said: “Spurious claims that the UK will in some way start accepting dangerous chemicals are simply unfounded scaremongering.“We are ready to provide the essential and safe regulation of chemicals. We will maintain a strong system that safeguards both human health and the environment.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are.

He also said all nonessential workers should stay home.\u0026nbsp“This is the most drastic action we can take,” said Mr Cuomo. “This is not life as usual.”There have been more than 192 deaths due to Covid-19 in New York, and there are now more than 54,800 people diagnosed in the United States. Health experts have urged people to practice social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than ever before in recent history, people are shuttered inside their homes across the nation and the world.

Mr Beshear has ordered all non-essential retail businesses closed until the end of a state of emergency, which has also seen him activate the national guard.The governor’s tone remained even throughout his address, but he made clear that the circumstances of the new case had infuriated him.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“My job in these press conferences is to talk to you about how we’re going to get through it — and we are — and that we’re going to do everything we can to protect the lives of those around us.“But this is one that makes me mad. And it should make you mad. Ultimately, the power of forgiveness — we get through this, we should forgive that person. But no more of these, anywhere, statewide, ever, for any reason.”The party seems to have been held by a group of young adults defying social distancing orders. Similar gatherings have been condemned in other states.In New York, now the epicentre of the US outbreak, a full lockdown has had to be imposed to stop people violating distancing rules. In Florida, meanwhile, CBS interviews showed young college students on spring break openly dismissing the risk of infection while drinking and mingling on the streets. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one.Mr Beshear clearly has no truck with this behaviour. Laying the potential consequences uncompromisingly at the distancing-defiers’ feet, he had sharp words for them:“We are battling for the health, and even the lives, of our parents and grandparents. And don’t be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people.“We ought to be much better than that.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You plan based on the data, based on the science, based on the numbers.\u0026nbspThe data says that is the high point of need,” the governor said on Saturday.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“You could need 140,000 hospital beds, and you could need 30,000 ventilators and that’s what the numerical projections say. So we’re planning for that, quote unquote, worst case scenario, which the models predict.”Mr Cuomo also postponed the state’s primary election from April until June, to avoid people gathering.\u0026nbspMr Cuomo’s comments same a day after Donald Trump attacked him on Twitter saying that ventilators sent to New York should be deployed immediately.\u0026nbspThe point is, ‘Well they’re in a stockpile, you must not need them’ is just ignorant — of course you don’t need them today!,” Mr Cuomo said on Friday. “You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000.

At the same time, if he failed to prepare for the worst he would not be doing his job.The comments underscore what has emerged as a potential major problem as the crisis has played out in the US, and Mr Trump has sought make the inidual states take responsibility for tackling the disease, with the support – but not leadership – of the federal government.Several state governors have condemned this approach, among them Washington governor Jay Inslee who told Mr Trump the governors were looking for a quarterback like “Tom Brady”.On Saturday, Mr Cuomo said the total number of infections in the state had reached more than 52,000 people, and the death toll had reached more than 700.“The government has said they have sent us 4000 ventilators those 4000 ventilators are not currently in use.\u0026nbspWhy? Because we don’t need them,” added Mr Cuomo.\u0026nbsp“What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need, and making sure we have the equipment the staff, the beds, for that critical need.”He said the cost of the machines had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 as other states had sought to buy them.\u0026nbspHe added: “We’re literally bringing up the price ourselves.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says. The symptoms of coronavirus are similar to other respiratory illnesses such as the flu and the common cold.However, with the flu, symptoms can come on much quicker than with coronavirus.According to the NHS, signs of flu include:You can treat yourself for flu by getting rest and staying warm.Taking paracetamol or ibuprofen can lower your temperature and treat aches and pains.Drinking plenty of water will help avoid dehydration.The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu, as well as spreading it to others.Its more effective to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season, which tends to run from December to March.The virus is believed to be transmitted between people through droplets spread from coughing and touching or shaking hands.While sneezing is not a symptom of the new coronavirus, it also thought to be a way that droplets can be spread.Symptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Experts say there is little evidence to suggest that people can spread the virus without showing symptoms.You should only call NHS  -

only bacteria.The NHS says that treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.Those who are infected will need to stay in isolation away from other people until they have recovered.Social distancing are government-recommended measures you can take to reduce social interaction with other people and help prevent coronavirus from spreading.They are to:The government also recommends that you keep at least two metres away from anyone who is not part of your household.The only proven symptoms of coronavirus, and therefore the only ones which require further action, are a dry cough, a fever high temperature and shortage of breath.However, there are a number of other mild symptoms which have been experienced by some patients.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has just taken this crisis to give us all a wake-up call to realise what is most important — our family, our friends and our fellow human beings.In my street we have set up a WhatsApp group so we can all help each other out getting shopping, medicine and simply checking to seeeveryone, especially the elderly and those living alone, are doing OK.And tens of thousands of you have heeded the Government’s call and volunteered to help deliver medicines and supplies to vulnerable patients on lockdown.I have signed up to have a chat with anyone who needs a bit of reassurance.Cab drivers are giving pensioners free transport. LA Taxis in Newcastle picked up dozens of elderly people to take them to the local supermarket and back home again with their essentials.Our youngsters have also been amazing.James Burnett, , from Grimsby, set up a Facebook group to connect people who want to help — and thousands have joined.He has also been taking sandwiches to his local hospital with sister Ellie-Mae, , and brothers Robbie, six and Oscar, four. I know hungry NHS workers enduring gruelling long shts are so grateful to these big-hearted youngsters.It truly brings a tear to my eye and I am so proud of all these thoughtful acts.To raise my spirits, I go for a daily walk with my little dog Angus. I do not see as many people as usual — and I obviously keep a safe distance from any I do — but I have seen a real change in attitude.Everyone now shouts a cheery greeting or exchanges a rueful smile and wave.There is a real sense of us all being in this together.Like many of you, I have been feeling anxious and unsettled, but focusing on the positives has been keeping me sane.YOU are our heroes daily!!! Thank you!!! We love you.KURT RIEMERYOU’RE all truly amazing.SOPHIA GODWINMaybe, just maybe, all of these small but important acts of kindness and that renewed and revitalised community spirit will continue when the virus has been defeated.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever. In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You wanted to make them normal.I’m so glad the people saw through your destructive policies at every election you fought. Unbelievable.And fellow Tory MP Alicia Kearns mocked: Corbyn fails to understand even the basics.The Labour leaders claims were also dismissed by leading economists.Ploughing huge sums into saving , lives and millions of jobs is not some lesson the Tories learned from Corbyn, no matter how tragically ­desperate he is for a “legacy”. It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.Julian Jessop from the Institute of Economic Affairs said: As usual, he’s missing the point.The current increase in Government spending is only a temporary stopgap until the emergency health measures can be removed and the market economy rebooted again.In contrast, Labour was proposing a permanent increase in the size and role of the state.The costs of the inidual measures being taken today are still relatively small compared to many of Labour’s proposals.

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor.

I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

The sight of groups of MPs gathering in groups to pass laws stopping the rest of us from gathering in groups was not a good look. It appeared literally like one law for the lawmakers and another for the locked-down rest of us. So Parliament upped sticks till after Easter. The Speaker had already ­announced a ban on alcohol in the Commons so it was questionable how long MPs would be able to sustain themselves anyway. The forward agenda was thin. Whether or not the scheduled Bill on toilet rate reliefwas “essential” was questionable in the current climate. But before packing their bags, MPs first had to provide legislative authority to the most draconian range of powers ever granted to the state in peacetime. Or indeed wartime. Hitler and the Luftwaffe never closed the bars or theatres and never imprisoned the population in the way that coronavirus has succeeded in doing. Forced quarantining, cancelled ­elections, allowing a single doctor – rather than two – to section people and reducing Parliamentary scrutiny of the state, including the security services. It’s a menu to whet the appetite of any would-be authoritarian tyrant. And it’s one that worries MPs. What , they fear, some of these emergency changes to the way we live were to slip into normality in the longer term  The Government was forced to accept that the powers enshrined in the Coronavirus Act – rushed through the Commons and Lords in just two days – should be reviewed every six months. How that works remains to be seen. Suspicions were raised as to whether the -page Bill – yes, parts of it have been up Whitehall’s sleeve for a while – was necessary at all. The Speaker’s own legal counsel, Daniel Greenberg, says all the ­provisions are covered by existing law. He should know – he wrote them.  The Government says the existing ones are “the wrong sort of law”. All sides in Westminster agree, the country is going through change and it must emerge stronger and better. The challenges are profound. Hot on the heels of the virus bill came another, supported by all parties, the Future Generations Bill. It calls for new procedures to take longer-term ­thinking into mainstream policy ­making, presenting Parliament with “an ­opportunity to act today for tomorrow, and level up opportunity between­ ­current and future generations”.

We were part of the rat race – work hard, make more so we could spend more. Because that is classed as success – the house, car, holidays, clothes, brands. It is how you’re judged.

The beauty and healthcare retailer has opened facilities at the theme park, as well as at its head office in Nottingham. The move is in a bid to support the Governmentaposs bid to test doctors and nurses who have been self-isolating and are unsure whether they have the virus.  The pioneering method of testing has only been used in a few locations across the country. Tests are currently being conducted by volunteers from Boots staff. It will offer free testing for NHS workers who are isolating themselves, unsurethey have coronavirus or not. Those eligible for the tests will be invited by their employer who will inform them of the process.  It comes as more than  people have now tested positive  for the virus in Nottinghamshire. Cases in Surrey almost doubled overnight on Thursday, spiking up to . By Friday, the figure had risen by another  people.  During a Government press conference on March , Michael Gove - who stood in for Boris Johnson after he tested positive for coronavirus - revealed increased testing capacity and said tests were being trialled immediately. Seb James, managing director for  Boots UK, said the company felt - as it has done for the past  years - it had a duty to step forward and be part of the solution to the ongoing crisis. He said: I am extremely proud that Boots is supporting COVID- testing for NHS workers. Boots has been at the heart of UK healthcare for  years and has always come forward to support the community in times of need. We will work with the NHS to recruit trained professionals – both Boots colleagues and from the wider community. I am sure there will be many trained healthcare clinicians and students, who will step forward to support our dedicated NHS colleagues. Locations are being defined but will be spread across the UK they will not however be in Boots stores, allowing our colleagues to focus on supporting our customers and patients.  The Government has before been criticised for its lack of testing options, particularly for NHS workers who are vital in the efforts to support those who are vulnerable and in critical need of care.

Speaking from the ship, which is stranded off the Pacic coast of Panama, -year-old Paul, from Huddersfield, said: “We feel such ­despair because we feel the Government wants to leave us adrt to die. “We haven’t had any word or a concerted effort from our Government. “The most frightening thing is we don’t know how anyone can manage the logistics of getting us home when we can’t even get into a port that will accept us.”  Cruise company Holland America is in a race to get healthy holidaymakers off the ship before the virus spreads further. Passengers are being tested for the bug and those in the clear are being transferred to sister ship, The Rotterdam, alongside it. Tonight the Wilsons’ daughter, Sally Dunkley, , said: “We are terried we will never see them again. Mum is so frightened she told us that the house now belongs to my brother and I, and Dad is checking all his le insurance is in order. “We are beyond worried. We’ve not had a word from the British Government about how they will deal with this. “The Rotterdam sent small boats with testing kits. Those who test positive will be left on the Zaandam which will essentially become a hospital ship.” The Wilsons’ ­journey went as planned until passengers started falling ill following a stop at Punta Arenas, Chile, on March . The ship tried to turn back to dock for passenger testing but was refused entry. There are fears the boat could become another Diamond Princess, which suffered  deaths after  passengers got Covid-. Guy Jones, son of fellow passengers Celia and Nick Jones, of Bristol, last night appealed for the UK Foreign Office to get involved. Nick, , a retired head teacher, and Celia, , went ahead with their holiday after Government guidelines said it was safe to travel to South America. Guy, , a theatre stage manager, said: “They seem to be quite well at the moment but our ­biggest worry is how they will get home. “When they were first put into lockdown on Monday, the announcement over the tannoy said about  people had fallen ill and it was a precautionary measure. But on Friday they were told four people had died.”  Elsewhere, British travellers stranded across the world have pleaded for chartered flights to be sent out after aircraft this week rescued , citizens stuck in Peru. Esther Hulme and Lewis Kellett, stranded in India, begged for help from the Foreign Office and claimed police “intimidate and beat” foreigners with sticks. India’s borders have been closed for  days to halt the spread of Covid- through its . billion population. Esther and Lewis, from Leeds, said they were kicked out of two hotels by staff and are now stuck in a hostel in Goa with  others, living off rice and crisps. Civil servant Esther, , said: “Today, queuing for food, police pulled out big sticks as an intimidation technique. I’ve heard of middle-aged British women left bruised from being hit. “The embassy advised us to follow local ­procedure but they don’t realise the reality.” Retired physicist John Siddle, , is among , Britons thought to be stranded in Bali. The grandad-of-three, from Southport, Merseyside, was quoted £, for a flight home via Australia to the UK.

These are just a few of the selfless hundreds of thousands who have signed up as NHS volunteers. They are ordinary people with their own worries but they are desperate to play their part in a world-wide crisis brought so close to home. From next week they will help deliver vital supplies such as food and essential medicine to the vulnerable, drive them home from hospital and make regular phone calls to those struggling in self-isolation. Here they tell compelling stories of why they have joined the fight. Iaposm honouring my murdered daughter  Andy McHugh is driven to help due to the pain of losing his daughter. Lucy, , was stabbed  times by her mum’s lodger after she threatened to expose him as an abuser. Since her death, Andy has found solace in community work and, when the plea was made for NHS volunteers, he applied immediately. He said: “I’m doing this in honour of Lucy. “She was a caring girl, she wanted to help and was always there to help her two siblings. She’d have been so happy to see how everyone is pulling together to fight this.” The teenager was killed by paedophile Stephen Nicholson, , who had been a lodger with her mum and stepdad at their Southampton home. He lured her to woodland before stabbing her in July  after she threatened to reveal he had been abusing her for a year.  Nicholson was jailed for a minimum of  years last July. Andy, , gave up his vaping business and started work as a community liaison officer after seeing the outpouring of grief for Lucy. He said: “I thought about how my mum used to sit on the doorstep with the neighbours and how things might have been dferent for Lucywe still had that sense of community and people knew what was going on in their street. “You do have to come to terms with your grief and try and move on. “Working in community has given me a bigger picture on le and when this virus has been beaten, I hope we will remember the way people came together. “Losing Lucy was the worst but sometimes you have to focus on the task in hand, and it’s all those vulnerable people in need.” Inspired by grandad who fought in World War   Emma Maslin was inspired to sign up by the example of her grandfather who fought on the beaches of Normandy in the Second World War. Her -year-old grandad Roy Chapillon is one of Britain’s . million vulnerable people self-isolating at home. Emma, , a money coach from Milton Keynes, said: “He fought in Germany and France so it seems minimal that we are being asked to stay at home bored and, even then, some people are still going out. “He’s been reading all about Covid- but I wonder how much people of his age are really worrying about it after all they’ve been through. “My mum sees him every day and stands far from his doorstep to check he’s OK but he seems to be doing reasonably well.” Emma has volunteered to talk to those who are stuck at home, saying: “It’s important we recognise the emotional toll this will have. “I’m in a fortunate position that I work from home and can phone people around my two girls who are six and eight. I’ve told them what volunteering is and why it’s important.” Mum-of-two Jo Jordan had just opened a new hair salon when the virus struck, forcing her to close. She is a single mum who lives in rented property. But rather than sit at home worrying, she has signed up as a volunteer to deliver essential medicine and food. Jo, who lives in Brough, East Yorks, said: “I know I’m not in a great position because I only opened my salon in February. “But I also know there are people a lot worse off. “I realise that somewhere down the line I will get some help, so I want to give something back. I can sit wallowing in self-pity or I can take action and think ‘Where can I help here ’.” The -year-old says she hopes the world will be a kinder place once the crisis is over. And she wants to set an example to daughters Isabelle, , and twelve-year-old Evie. “The girls have already noticed how things are changing,” she said. “We’ve been going out for a walk every day and suddenly people are taking time to say hello to each other. “I just hope it will last.” Helping lonely people during the lockdown  Andrew Ward and we Kate worry about how the lonely will cope. They were thinking about volunteering when the call went out for people to support the NHS.

The measures may have to be introduced in the coming weeks as the outbreak reaches its peak, to further reduce ‘person-to-person’ interaction. The UK’s Covid- death toll now stands at  after it claimed the lives of  people yesterday - amounting to a worrying % jump in just  hours.A senior government adviser has now suggested that the number of deaths will continue to rise for at least the next three weeks and peak at Easter, the Daily Mail reports.They also warned thatthis figure continues to spiral, “greater enforcement” of social distancing measures will be needed. “I expect death numbers to increase over two, three or four weeks, and then to gradually decrease,” they said. Although the adviser said hospitals should be able to cope with the outbreak, they admitted that “we can’t guarantee it” with intensive care units under particular pressure. Among the  new deaths announced yesterday,  were in England, the NHS said.  The patients were aged between  and  years old and all but four - aged between  and  - had underlying health conditions. The total number of confirmed Covid- cases in the UK now stands at , - however, the true figure is likely to be much higher as many patients displaying symptoms are not being tested. Structural biologist Professor Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, says that those dying in the coming days will have been infected before the lockdown was brought into force. “This means we are likely to continue to see further increases in the numbers of daily deaths until social distancing measures have their effect,” he said.Today marks five days since the UK public were told by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stay at home to save lives."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus worlds oldest man celebrates","story":"NewsCoronavirus forces world’s oldest man to celebrate th birthday aloneBob Weighton lived through the Spanish flu pandemic which decimated the worlds population when he was ten - and is about to celebrate his th birthday in coronavirus lockdownShareCommentsByKara ONeillBen Mitchell:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBob is about to turn  but he doesnt want another birthday telegram from the Queen \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Bob took the title of oldest man in the world last month after the death of the previous holder, Chitetsu Watanabe of Japan. Last year, the former teacher and engineer celebrated with his many friends at his retirement flat but this year the supercentenarian - someone aged  and older - is under lockdown like the rest of the country. He said: Everything is cancelled, no visitors, no celebration. Itaposs a dead loss as far as celebration is concerned. Mr Weighton lived through the Spanish flu pandemic which swept around the globe in , when he was  years old, killing between  and  million people.He said: I only read about it in history books when I got older. Actually I wasnapost aware there was a Spanish flu around because none of my brothers and sisters or people I knew were affected. I am sure they were, but a childaposs world is not an adultaposs world, a child doesnapost read the newspapers and there was no radio in those days so you didnapost get news in the sense you get it thrown at you in all directions nowadays. Mr Weighton said that now the world is in a bit of a mess with coronavirus and it worries him because nobody knows what is going to happen.  He added that, unlike the two World Wars he lived through, the challenge of Covid- is the unknown elements of battling the virus. He said: In the Second World War you knew what you had to do, you might fail but the objectives were clear as Churchill rallied the country behind him, aposWe will fight on the beachesapos, etc etc. We knew exactly what we had to do. That was an objective that you could possibly reach, but nobody knows how we are going to defeat the virus.  He said the impact on him of self-isolation was that he had become more dependent on the Brendon care home where he lives, particularly for meals and from the assistant who helps him clean and lt heavier objects. He said: It means that I have to be more self-sufficient, do my own cooking, cleaning, read the books that I havenapost read. “I am less capable of doing things for myself than I was  years ago - I canapost lt the weights, I canapost move as fast, I canapost even dress myself properly. I depend very much on other people these days.  Mr Weighton said he had no secret to his longevity, adding: I never intended to be this old. When you are young, you donapost think about what is going to happen when youaposre old, youaposre self-engaged, all you think about is the here and now. But he did say that his wide general interests from reading to constructing model windmills keep him active and young. Those are things you do either naturally or donapost do. People who complain are those who donapost explore things that they might do themselves, he said. Mr Weighton added that he has turned down the traditional birthday greeting from the Queen. I wonapost be getting one because I donapost want one, he said.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA chat at the school gates with a fellow dad saved Mark Wilson’s le. Mark, , was seriously ill with kidney disease but feared time was running out as he waited for a donor. He opened up to Andy McCall, , as they waited for their daughters. In an act of incredible selflessness, Andy offered to seehe was a match. Blood and tissue tests confirmed he was and the transplant went ahead on Valentine’s Day this year. Mark said: “When Andy offered, I couldn’t believe it. He was pretty much a complete stranger. “When my family heard he was a match, we burst into tears. Even the kidney co-ordinator was crying. “It felt like our paths meant to cross. He knows I’ll never be able to repay him. He has saved my le.”  Andy said: “Helping Mark was a no-brainer. “I had the chance to shape someone ’s le. There’s no better feeling.” Now the two fitness fans, who both have two young children, are the best of friends. A year ago Mark’s world came crashing down as he and we Victoria, , a marketing executive, from Gourock, near Glasgow, were planning a holiday with children, Emilie, five, and one-year-old Lucas.A routine check through his work at an Audi bodyshop found his blood pressure was up almost double.Mark, who works out three times a week, looked so healthy that medics initially thought there was something wrong with their kit. “They said, ‘There must be something wrong with the readings because you shouldn’t be able to stand’,” he recalled.  But tests at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital showed he had  per cent kidney . He was diagnosed with stage five kidney disease and told he needed a transplant. By August, his kidneyhad declined to just seven per cent and he was told he would need to begin peritoneal dialysis, which uses the lining of the abdomen to filter the blood. He had a tube fitted in his stomach so he could carry out the treatment himself four times a day. Mark recalled: “Dialysis meant I couldn’t work anymore, and I actually started to feel ill for the first time. “I had no energy and could no longer play with the children for long, or go to the gym.”  We Victoria nicknamed him “the healthiest looking sick guy”. She explained: “When he was diagnosed, people kept saying to him ‘you don’t look sick’ or ‘for someone so ill you look great’ so I said one day he was the healthiest looking sick guy I’d ever seen and then the name stuck.” One day Mark got chatting to Andy, a college apprentice co-ordinator from Greenock, at the school gates as they collected their daughters from nursery. Struck by the similarities between the young families, Andy thought about what it would be likehis le was turned upside down. Meanwhile, Mark’s mum and we offered a kidney but they were not perfect matches. With Mark in desperate need of a donor, Victoria decided to run a km race to raise money for Kidney Research UK.She uploaded a post explaining her husband’s situation to Facebook, which was spotted by Andy.Moved by what he read, Andy – father of Lily, five, and Lewis, two, with his radiographer we Laura – offered to help. “It just felt like it could so easily be me,” he said. “The thought that my le could be taken away from me in an instant really hit home. “I said to Laura, ‘Our families are so similar, we are the same age, with kids the same age, and Mark and I are both into our fitness’.”The four-hour transplant operation took place with both dads side by side inhospital beds.Andy said: “Before we went in, we had our picture taken and wished one another other good luck.” Andy was able to be by Mark’s bedside as he came round from surgery. “I felt proud that I’d been given the opportunity to help change his le and his family’s le. It was an emotional moment,” said Andy. “I told him he was looking really good and we gave each other a high five.” Within  hours of the transplant, Mark’s kidneywent from six to . per cent. Andy stayed in hospital for three days, during which time he was a frequent visitor to Mark’s room. Mark was discharged after a week and both families got together the following night to toast his health with champagne. After taking a couple of months off work to recover, keen runner Andy is back to full health and was even able to run again just over a week after the operation. Mark is feeling “better than ever”. Victoria said: “After the operation, Mark immediately looked better, his blue eyes had started shining again and after a few days he was back on his feet, gradually building up strength and taking gentle exercise.” Having forged a lelong friendship, the men have been out for dinner and drinks, as well as taking their children to soft play together. Mark said: “We’re having to isolate for now because of Covid- but we’ve been keeping each other entertained over WhatsApp. “We’re in touch most days. And now I’ve got a runner’s kidney, maybe I’ll join him for a jog. “As well as getting a new kidney, I’ve got a new friendship. It’s hard to put into words how much it means.” "},{"url":null,"title":"david attenborough says coronavirus short","story":"NewsDavid Attenborough says coronavirus is short-term problem - climate change isntEXCLUSIVE: Ahead of the release of his new show David Attenborough: A Le On Our Planet the champion of the planet warns the world not to take its eyes off the climate changeShareCommentsBySarah Robertson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror film video david-attenborough-le-planet-trailer-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news david-attenborough-says-coronavirus-short-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

But Sir David – whose film A Le On Our Planet has been put back to November because of the pandemic – says the virus is no real surprise. He tells the Sunday Mirror: “There’s always been plagues. There are diseases.“That is part of the natural world and tightly packed as we are and travel as we do, it is hardly surprisingit spreads.

It charts his astonishing -year career and highlights just how the natural world is being eroded. He also hopes it will be shown in schools as a warning to the next generation.  The veteran campaigner feels guilty about his own carbon footprint – and even frets about putting the heating on. But he accepts there are environmental pitfalls to modern le. Sir David, , says: “I thought I’d put on a jersey and not turn on the electric bar to write what I had been writing and, of course, you do those things. But let’s not say, ‘Forgive me for breathing’. ■ Sir David was raised at the former university college, Leicester, where his father was the principal. ■ The renowned globetrotter doesn’t drive – he never passed his test. ■ He likes all animals except rats, saying: “I can’t think of anything more ghastly – it’s come out a bloody sewer!” ■ Sir David first applied to work at the BBC as a radio producer but didn’t get the job. it was TV’s gain. ■ He has one place to tick off on his travel wishlist – the Gobi Desert, which spans china and Mongolia. “We all have a carbon footprint, but it doesn’t mean you have to wear a hairshirt or don’t ever cross the Atlantic. “It’s perfectly proper to travel in Europe in order to live a civilised le, and producing carbon dioxide is inevitable so we couldn’t suddenly say we’ve got to stop living. “All you can do is make sure you live to certain standards and take elementary attitudes towards electricity.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eight signs you coronavirus covid","story":"NewsEight signs you had coronavirus Covid- before the outbreak -

Research carried out by Oxford Universityaposs Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group suggests that Covid- may have reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. The scenario is one of the several the researchers presented as possible, and goes against previously understood death rates. In the non-peer reviewed study they suggest that the coronavirus, like many emerging infections, may have spread invisibly for a month before its effects became clear at the end of February. If the Oxford researchers are right, then as much as half of the countryaposs population may already have been infected. Many people have contactedto claim that they experienced symptoms linked to Covid- in the weeks following the New Year. Below are the eight symptoms that may suggest you have already been infected by the coronavirus. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog Eye infections New research has indicated that eye infection such as conjunctivitis may be a symptom of Covid-. The College of Optometrists said: It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid- without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred. A dry cough Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough - and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day. Mental fatigue    Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. A high temperature    Although numbers y for dferent people, a rise in body temperature generally counts as a fever once it reaches .C . You can tell you have a feveryou feel hot to the touch on your chest or back. Itaposs dficult to catch your breath If your chest starts to feel tight or you cannot breath, you may have caught the coronavirus. Most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. Loss of sense of smell and taste    Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea. Physical fatigue    Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult.

His daughter Louise, , said: “There were many times when we thought weaposd lose him but he just kept fighting. “My dad is an absolute warrior.” Tam, who lives in Linwood, Scotland, was previously fit and healthy and enjoyed walking his beloved German Shepherd Zak before his double heart attack in October. The former fire station janitor was told he would need a stent inserted into his heart after his cardiac arrests but while waiting for surgery he developed a chest infection and doctors were unable to operate.  On Christmas Eve he was admitted to hospital after his condition worsened before undergoing a quadruple bypass on December . But complications arose during surgery and left Tam’s brain starved of oxygen. Despite everything he pulled through and was sent home in January. But just a few weeks later he was rushed to hospital after he haemorrhaged during the night. He was sent to intensive care with severe internal bleeding. Tam then suffered multiple strokes between late January and early February and lost all his cognitive movement. “He couldn’t even hold a cup,” added his daughter Louise. But the mum-of-three said that with the help of amazing NHS staff, Tam recovered and began to show signs of his old self. She said: He didnapost lose his speech so his brilliant, witty patter never disappeared. In the weeks that followed, Tamaposs family met with medics to discuss him being discharged from hospital. But last week, while still an in-patient, Tam suddenly developed a cough.

The -year-old did not have severe symptoms and her family had hoped she would pull through to celebrate her th birthday on April , reports the Manchester Evening News. Hilda first showed signs of the virus four days ago and a test came back positive, confirming she was suffering from Covid-. Hilda is thought to be the oldest person in Greater Manchester to have contracted the virus. Her grandson Anthony Churchill says she will be greatly missed by her large extended family. “She did so much for us,” he says. “We were always with her on weekends as kids. She did so much for all the grandkids. “She was a proper grandma as well. She would always have a pinny on and she’d be baking. She just could not throw any food away. You’d never go hungry. “She was very loving. She couldn’t do enough for people.” Originally from Crewe, Hilda moved up to Salford with her husband during the depression to find work. Born in , the former seamstress, was a popular figure with her neighbours and was known for her kind nature and baking skills. “She always talks about the neighbours cadging a pinch of salt and other bits during the war,” Anthony says. “She’d still make the best homemade gravy I have ever tastedyou let her near a kitchen.  “And her scones and mince pies - people were queuing up the street to get them at Christmas. “She was very independent. She hated anyone having to do anything for her.” In the weeks before her death, Anthony had started to talk to his grandma about the virus. She was able to offer a perspective on the pandemic that few others could. He says: “My grandma likes to talk. As I was telling her about his coronavirus she started talking about the Spanish flu and she remembered how bad that was. “The whole house came down with it except her mum, who looked after everyone . “Sadly her little sister, who was only  months old, died of it. Grandma said she remembers a small box being put in a carriage. “Her dad collapsed in the street with it, but survived. “She was saying how amazing it is that something you can’t see can be so devastating.” Anthony, , says Hilda was in good health up until recently having never smoked or drunk much in her le and after staying active for decades. She only moved into the care home ten months ago and, up until then, had lived alone in her home in Walkden.  The mother-of-four, grandmother of eleven and great grandmother of  had, in recent years, also welcomed great grandchildren into the family. Anthony says: “My grandma never understood how she got so old and she’d say that. I think it was the hard work that kept her going.

Sophie Biddle, , revealed she is fit and well in a welcome piece of good news amid the pandemic gloom. She was in her second trimester when she was diagnosed four weeks ago. Sophie even felt her baby kick for the first time while in self-isolation. Fortunately her symptoms were mild. After two weeks in isolation, she has been given the all-clear toto her job as an NHS physiotherapist. That means she will soon be treating patients in the community who are themselves recovering from wretched Covid-. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog Sophie had her -week scan last Monday and it revealed she is expecting a healthy baby boy. Speaking out to other expectant mums – like Carrie Symonds, who is self-isolating after her PM fiancé Boris Johnson got the virus – Sophie said: “I’ve had a lot of messages from pregnant women worried about the virus. “So, while everyone is dferent, I want people to know that I recovered quickly. The NHS were brilliant and I’m really proud to work with them. “I’m going to be treating patients who are recovering from Covid-. “I’m probably one of the safest people to be around now!”  Sophie, from Chelmsford in Essex, began experiencing mild symptoms of the virus in late February when her partner ed from Milan. The city has been under lockdown for weeks as badly-hit Italy struggles to contain the virus. But Sophie thinks it’s equally possible she could have picked up the illness on her crowded commute to London. She said: “I had a cough, a runny nose and a headache, and took three days off work. Then my partner developed symptoms – he was slightly feverish and chesty.  “We rang  purely because of my partner’s travel history and then things really kicked off. “We were told to drive to AE and sit outside with our hazard lights on and stay in the car, where a nurse in a hazmat suit posted nasal swabs through the car window.” Sophie and her partner were sent home to self-isolate. But medics told them to sleep in separate rooms as they were unsurethey had built up immunity – and were worried they could reinfect each other. By this point, Sophie had started to feel better. She kept herself fit by doing ballet barre-style exercises in her isolation room. On March  she got a call from Public Health England to confirm she had tested positive.  Sophie, who has been writing an isolation blog, said: “My first reaction was shock, really. “I said, ‘Are you sure ’ But as my symptoms were mild I knew I’d be okay and they’d have a plan for me.” As the UK was still trying to contain the virus at this point, health officials called Sophie repeatedly. They took names and contact numbers of everyone she had been in recent contact with, and called the hospital where she worked to find out whether anyone  had been ­experiencing symptoms. Sophie went on: “My brother had been visiting from Sweden so they tested him too. “But he didn’t have the virus. Some people were scared when they found out they’d had contact with us. “But once they learned a bit more about the virus they were more understanding. “The whole time I was off work, I had absolutely amazing support from the NHS.” "},{"url":null,"title":"italian man 101 born during","story":"NewsItalian man, , born during Spanish flu survives coronavirus as death toll risesThe deputy mayor of Rimini said a -year-old man, who was born during the Spanish flu, has survived coronavirus.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMost of us understand it’s vital we stay indoors, unless our work keeps others alive. This is why the workplaces allowed to carry on are hospitals, supermarkets – and building sites. Because it’s essential in these harsh times that we finish building -storey glass office blocks on the edge of Leeds, so they can remain empty for nine years before being let out to an insurance company from Saudi Arabia. Some people suggest building firms are exempt because their owners have complained they can’t let their profits suffer. But that’s too cynical. The real reason must be that it’s crucial for our morale to still hear the distant thud of a JCB churning up concrete. It makes a pretty harmony with the blackbirds and gives us a reason to keep going. Given how this virus spreads, to have one million building workers still operating will almost certainly add to the fatalities. But never mind because while their families will miss Uncle Sid, they’ll know it was through his sacrice that it was possible to complete a block of riverside apartments no one can afford. And they will carry that pride forever.  The Prime Minister took care to protect builders, saying it would be possible for them to do their work safely by always staying six feet apart. This must come from Boris Johnson’s extensive experience of working on building sites. Because plastering, roofing and plumbing are the first things you learn at Eton. So these instructions should make building work fun, as labourers throw bags of cement and bricks and scaffold pipes at each other from two metres, with their colleagues ing to catch them. Carpenters will shout: “You hold that in place, Dave, and I’ll put this nail through it with my eight-foot-long hammer.”  And as long as everyone remembers not to get close when they’re handing someone a cup of tea, but put it in a bucket and deliver it by crane, they’ll all be perfectly safe. If you believe what the scientists and doctors are saying, why would you think it’s all right for one million building workers to carry on working  The Government must have information they haven’t told us. Maybe the virus can’t get through a high-vis jacket. Or tea with four or more sugars is the antidote, so builders are immune.  Also, the number travelling into work has been cut to one-third of normal, but the number of trains and tubes running has also been cut to one-third of normal. So the trains are exactly as packed as they always were. Still, it would be unfair to expect the Government to work out dficult sums like that, with everything  they have to do.

At the moment, weaposve all got to look after each other but this guy was only worried about himself, nobody .  Just donapost be selfish, think of everyone . People are dying daily from this. The Mercedes driver contacted the MEN after the video was published on Friday morning. He said he only intended to take one pair of gloves, but accidentally grabbed the lot and was then too embarrassed tothem.  The man said: I deeply regret taking them. It was selfish and irresponsible. I am going to make a donation to an NHS charity or a charity thataposs helping with coronavirus. I just wanted to grab one pair, but they were all clumped together and they all came out at once. To be honest I was a bit embarrassed to put them back, so I just threw them on the car seat.

Trainee banker Ingrid Newkirk could not leave the helpless creatures so she took them to a shelter. Her visit to the dank and squalid refuge would change her le – and triggered her crusade to improve the care and welfare of animals. And in March  Ingrid founded the campaign group Peta – People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Its high-profile protests and by backing of glamorous stars who would bare all for the cause has turned it into one of the world’s most ­formidable animal rights’ group.  Big name actresses include Pamela Anderson, Kim Basinger, Gillian Anderson and Eva Mendes have all stripped off for Peta. Its hard-hitting campaigns aimed to show the truth behind industries such as animal-tested products and industrial meat production. Ingrid, now , said: “Politics, sex and conflict always dominates the news. Causes are always struggling to make it on to the news but everyone looks at ­celebrities. Everyone looksthe word naked is there. We seized on those two things.” Some of Peta’s most shocking moments include ex-Baywatch star Anderson’s near naked body labelled like an animal carcass in  and nude Spanish model Elen Rivas opposing bullfighting with spears in her back. Porn star Jenna Jameson ­campaigned for the use of pleather – plastic leather.  Peta’s  “Holocaust on your plate” demo compared factory ­farming to human death camps and caused outrage. Peta has grown into the world’s largest animal rights organisation with . million members and supporters.Ingrid has led from the front having stripped off and been thrown in prison cells for her protests. Softly spoken but steely in her resolve, Ingrid never planned a le of activism. As a child she loved meat and at , living in her native Surrey, even purchased a squirrel fur coat which she thought she looked “fabulous” in. But finding the kittens in Washington DC in  changed all that. She persuaded workers at the shelter to give her a job.  Peta started with like-minded ­people thinking how they could be kinder to animals. Ingrid slowly changed. She ­inspected homes and farms for the shelter and became a vegetarian after seeing a dead piglet. When she saw a dead squirrel and fox, she threw away her fur coat and fox pelt collar. She said: “My boyfriend sent me a roast chicken when I became vegetarian, knowing I wouldn’t be able to resist the smell. I had to sit him down and tell him ‘I love meat and don’t want to give it up so you have to support me to do this’. He was humbled.”  Peta attracted worldwide ­attention after its first campaign which exposed the treatment of  wild-born macaque monkeys from the Philippines being kept in the Institute for Behavioural Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, US. Peta has legions of ­supporters but Ingrid herself has been the star of many campaigns, including its call to strip off: “I’d ­rather go naked than wear fur.” She said: “When I strip off I’m always a bit knock kneed, it’s often cold just wearing ­knickers. You are like Lady Goa,not as ­attractive, ­doing something to make people think twice about animal cruelty.”  Ingrid has also hung topless from a butcher’s hook beside headless pigs in , broken into the US Vogue offices been thrown in the New York cells with rock star Chrissie Hynde after demonstrating in a Gap store in Manhattan. She said: “With the pig ­campaign, the butchers were there, the carcass cutters were there and they all came out to have a look at me. “I wanted them to look. They are the ones that cut the heads off the pig. My body is the same colour as the pigs’. The only dference was I still had my head on. They came out to mock but ended up quite quiet.”  Peta’s campaigns achieved changes in the fashion industry’s attitude to fur. Designers ­including Victoria Beckham, Prada and Chanel banned it from their runways. Ingrid, who lives in Washington DC, won’t even let death stop her campaigning. After narrowly surviving a light aircraft flight she made provisions for her corpse to be of use. She said: “My liver will go to France to protest the force feeding of ducks and geese for foie gras. I want a leg made into an umbrella stand because elephant’s legs are made into knick-knacks. I want part of my flesh to be cooked with ­onions and garlic and people to be told that it’s human flesh – what dference does it make ” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus meghan harry should return","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry mustto UK to help Queen, says her dad ThomasEXCLUSIVE: Upset Thomas Markle says his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry shouldto London and is disappointed they went to Los Angeles - while she still has not been in touch despite him being at high-riskShareCommentsByPatrick Hill:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-baby-archie-harrison-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news coronavirus-meghan-harry-should--\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Mr Markle is still hoping they will reverse their decision to give up their roles as full-time royals.In an exclusive interview, Thomas told the Sunday Mirror: “I think Meghan and Harry should go back to the Royal family in the UK and be supportive of the Queen.“I think they should be in England at this time and not in LA.” He added: “I really support the idea of them going back to the royal family. “They can join the A-list and make lots of money, of course, when the problem with the virus is over. “But they will never find the respect they would have as full members of the royal family.” The retired Hollywood lighting director sent his best wishes to both the Queen and Prince Charles, who is in self-isolation after contracting Covid-.  He revealed Meghan has still not contacted him, despite him being at high-risk of the virus due to his heart condition. He again begged her and Harry for forgiveness and said he hopes the pandemic will remind them what is important in le. And he admitted he is worried Meghan could now be struck down by the virus, which is raging in Calornia, where she and Harry set up in their new home earlier this month, just days before President Trump implemented a travel ban.  Thomas said: “I am in the high risk category, but now a number of young people are also coming down with it. “If I could say anything to Harry and Meghan right now it is that le is too short. “I would certainly tell them to be careful and I would tell them that I love them. “This is the time to think about what is really important in le - it’s too short and unpredictable. “While we have to isolate physically, there is no reason to isolate personally from each other at this time.”  Thomas is at high-risk of contracting coronavirus due to his age and a string of underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, hypertension and prediabetes. He hasn’t spoken to Meghan since he missed her wedding to Harry after suffering a heart attack in May . They fell out shortly before the ceremony after it emerged he had collaborated with a paparazzi photographer to make money from staged photos. And he has yet to meet his son-in-law or grandson Archie,  months.  Thomas is desperately hoping Harry, , will see anyone can make a mistake after he was duped by Russian pranksters impersonating eco-activist Greta Thunburg and her dad Svante. The Prince was duped in two phone calls with notorious jokers Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, during which he indiscreetly told them he is “completely separate” from most of the Royal Family and spoke openly about his agony over “Megxit”.He also opened up to the fake Greta about the tension at the heart of the Royal Family and was also critical of US president Donald Trump. Mr Markle said: “We all think we do something right and it turns out to be wrong. “Harry recently made a huge mistake talking to those Russian pranksters. “He got tricked by those pranksters and I got tricked by doing those photos.  “We all make mistakes and I made a huge mistake. “I should forgive them and they should forgive me. “Ultimately, maybe it’s time for Archie to say hello to grandpa.”  Thomas lives alone in Rosarito, Mexico, just over the border from Calornia, which is now in Covid- lockdown. He has been suffering from a cold for the last two months, but insists it is not coronavirus.  He is now preparing to go into self-isolation in Mexico. He said: “I have a good supply of food in, I’m ready to self-isolate and stay at home. I have more than enough food and water.” Thomas is now preparing to be a witness in the legal battle over a letter Meghan wrote to him detailing her heartbreak at their rt. He originally kept silent about Meghan’s five-page note posted to his home. But six months later its existence was revealed in a US magazine, anonymously quoting fivefriends of Meghan. Thomas felt the nameless pals attacked him and misrepresented the letter, prompting him to take it to a UK newspaper.

Disability advocates say they are aposdisturbedapos by the guidelines published by the state of Alabama on rationing ventilators should the pandemic stretch their resources. New guidance published Alabama officials says that ‘persons with severe mental retardation, advanced dementia or severe traumatic brain injury may be poor candidates for ventilator support.’ It goes on to say that ‘persons with severe or profound mental retardation, moderate to severe dementia, or catastrophic neurological complications such as persistent vegetative state are unlikely candidates for ventilator support.’ Similar guidance has been issued in Washington and Arizona, with medics in the latter state instructed to ‘allocate resources to patients whose need is greater or whose prognosis is more likely to result in a positive outcome with limited resources.’ Disability advocacy groups have filed complaints against the US Department of Health and Human Servicesfor further clarication on the guidance. They are are seeking assurances that disabled people will not be discriminated against when it comes to receiving emergency care.  Those same groups say many of the million Americans who live with such disabilities are already at higher risk of Covid- because they often live in group homes – a known hotspot for deadly outbreaks of the virus. HHS spokesman Roger Severino has insisted that US civil rights laws ‘protect the equal dignity of every human being from ruthless utilitarianism,’ but experts have questioned whether those laws will still be applied during a nationwide medical crisis. Ari Ne’erman, a scholar at the Lurie Institiute for Disability Policy at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said: What we’re seeing here is a clash between disability rights law and ruthless utilitarian logic. What this is really about at the end of the day is whether our civil-rights laws still apply in a pandemic. I think that’s a pretty core question as to who we are as a country.  News website Tuscon also highlighted the tragic death of Emily Wallace, a  year-old woman with Downaposs syndrome who was infected with Covid- at her Georgia care home, and later died. Wallace previously hit the headlines after she and husband Richard became the first couple with Downaposs syndrome in Georgia to marry, with the pair living happily until Richard’s death in . She then moved into a care home, where she was infected by a care worker who had previously caught the virus.

And thanks to the UKaposs lockdown, weaposve got more time than ever to do the dreaded jobs most of us are guilty of putting off time after time. And who do we look to when it comes to cleaning advice - Mrs Hinch, obviously. While the cleaning guruaposs tips are not in any way linked to the coronavirus pandemic, fans are still using them to make sure their house is as clean as possible at this strange time. Sophie Hinchlfeaposs tips and tricks made her a social media star, and the contents of her cleaning cupboard - dubbed her Narnia - always fly off the supermarket shelves.  But what are Mrs Hinchaposs tips for cleaning every room in your house, and which products do you need in your very own Narnia   Here, she reveals all... Kitchen Mrs Hinchaposs kitchen is utterly immaculate.From the spotless work tops, to the gleaming floor and the sparkling sink - every surface is shined to perfection.  So, how does she get it in such tip top shape   First, she starts with the sink.  Mrs Hinch uses soda crystals in her plugs. She pours some down and then follows it with white vinegar.   Once itaposs fizzed she makes the whole room smell amazing by pouring a capful of her favourite  Zoflora and leaves for five minutes.  Next, she pours a kettle full of boiling water down the sink to get rid of the soda crystals. To achieve the amazing sparkle on her sink Mrs Hinch uses her go-to favourite, Pink Stuff, wiping it all over the sink and then wiping it away.  She then uses a pine disinfectant and wipes the whole sink with her Minky - a must-have for any member of the Hinch Army. And to get that all important shine, Mrs Hinch then uses C Stainless Steel, sprays it on, leaves it for  minutes and then she wipes it off with Buddy, her name for the Spontext Microfibre Kitchen cloths.  Next, she tackles the floor. Using her trusty Vera , she uses diluted Zoflora mix to mop floors. This works on laminate or or tiles and the instructions of how to make up the diluted mix are on the box. For a deep clean, Mrs Hinch mops with Trace .  She vaccums up all the crumbs on her work tops, getting right into the corners, and makes sure she shakes her toaster to remove all the bits of bread.  Mrs Hinch uses a Zoflora mix, which she puts in a spray and works across her work tops, using a Pinky to clean away any mess.   She makes sure she does this every night before she goes to bed.  On her halogen hob and glass oven door, Mrs Hinch  uses her Kermit, a Minky M Cloth, and some white vinegar.  She wipes plugs and light switches down with C Power and Shine wipes.  And how to get the bottom of your frying pans super clean, Mrs Hinch style - she uses Fairy Power Spray, which she leaves on for three minutes and then and scrubs away. For a basic oven clean, take the racks out and soak them in washing up liquid and warm water.  Then roughly wipe them down with C Power and Shine.  Put a tea towel on the floor and open the oven. Using a generous dollop of Pink Stuff on your Minky, which youaposve dipped in a glass of warm water and washing up liquid.   Wipe the oven to remove crumbs from the door and then rub the Pink Stuff in with Minky.  Do the same to the inside of the oven and leave it for five minutes.  Go back to the racks and use Minky to rub excess Pink Stuff into them then leave.  With Minky still a bit damp rub it all into the racks, squeeze it out and rub it in again with a little water. Rinse out Minky and use other side to get rid of all the Pink Stuff.  Rinse Minky again with no bubbles and use it to finish wiping the oven.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

To use it, you have to prick your finger to produce a drop of blood, which is analysed on the device.The test detects the presence of IGM, an antibody that appears in your body early on in the infection, and IGG, which increases when the body responds to the virus.It takes just  to  minutes to complete the test.The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.How will the test help fight coronavirus In a previous briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that these types of tests could be a ldquogame changer in regards to the ongoing pandemic.Speaking to the Huffington Post, Professor Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, University of Oxford, said that these types of tests would be ldquotransformational in the fight against the virus.She said: ldquoWe can make sure wersquove got doctors or nurses who can work safely in hospitals.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

keeping a distance of at least two metres from anyone other than those you live with.However, going for walks and exercising is still allowed as long as the two-metre distance from others is kept.The footage of the packed car parks and shops led to two councillors calling for the beach car parks to be closed.Conservative Councillor Craig Hoy called for the local authority to close or restrict car parking at the beaches.And SNP Group leader Councillor Stuart Currie said he had written to the council askingfor the coastal car parks to be shut down.Mr Currie said: ldquoWe cannot go on allowing mass gatherings like this in the midst of the current public health emergency.However, some people who attended the beaches hit back on social media, pointing out the large size of the beaches and insisting that people were complying with the Governmentrsquos social distancing advice by keeping two metres away from others while visiting the scenic coast and getting exercise.One said on Facebook:ldquoIt wasnrsquot mass gatherings at that beach, there was literally no one near anyone.Another added:ldquoWide open spaces like a beach are a great place to get fresh air and exercise while also adhering to social distancing rules, exactly as the Government and chief medical officer advises.It was also suggestedthat it was much easier to keep two metres away from others on a beach than in a shop.It is understood that the council faces a practicle issue about physically closing the car parks, which do not have barriers.East Lothian Council scrapped plans to introduce barriers when it started charging people to use the coastal car parks five years ago because of problems allowing blue badge holders free

I donrsquot envy any son or daughter reminding their mother or father of their vulnerability, and urging them to take seriously the mortal threat that lies beyond the gate.To see children laying down the law is yet another example of a world gone bananas. You could call it pay-back. Did any of us manage to get through adolescence without coming under constant sniper attack  Most parents griped and girned until their hair turned grey. In our household you could set the clock by the raised voices chivvying us to get out to school, or turn down the radio, or help with the washing up. The small print of parent-child contracts includes the adultrsquos right to scold, ponticate and nag as often as required. Juniorrsquos side of the bargain makes no provision for reasoned argument, protest or rebellion. It states simply that they must unquestioningly obey, preferably for all time.The irony of policing onersquos parents behaviour doesnrsquot make this any easier. But perhaps therersquos a frisson of satisfaction in being able to exact revenge on those who spent the best years of their lives hectoring and carping. Could it feel like a righting of old wrongs to chastise dad for his recklessness, or ask a -year-old to grow up when she suggests an SAS-style dawn-raid on the supermarket It is especially satisfying, surely, that the role reversal necessary to reinforce these new rules is done in the name of commonsense and caring. When the point of the exercise is to protect the lives of those you love, in terms of moral high ground itrsquos up there with Macchu Pichu. What possible riposte can anyone give when urged to take precautions not just to safeguard yourself, but those closest to you Yet as most handbooks to raising a family suggest, nagging is futile. It sets up a vicious circle of resentment and rebellion, and makes the one being chastised feel sore. When people are lectured, they switch off, mentally reaching for the headphones until the tone of voice improves. Whether yoursquore  or , that never changes. So, as a mass technological revolution is rolled-out, with elderly luddites being all but forcibly initiated into the art of video calling, more trouble lies ahead.In an old-fashioned phone conversation, finger-wagging offspring canrsquot see their loved ones rolling their eyes, putting an invisible gun to their temples, or mouthing ldquoGive me a break!. But as soon as they can observe the impact their words are having itrsquoll be like travelling back in time. Theyrsquoll see these beloved faces taking on an unfamiliar juvenile expression: sullen irritation, avoidance of eye contact, nail-biting, fidgeting, a huffily shrugged shoulder.The longer these virus vigilantes bang on, the less response theyrsquoll get. The age-old aria between adult and adolescent is an unequal contest: a torrent of words in one corner, mutinous monosyllables in the other. I donrsquot doubt for a moment that most older folk will pay heed to their familyrsquos concerns. Like any self-respecting teenager, however, theyrsquoll probably pretend not to have heard a word."},{"url":null,"title":"health-secretary-matt-hancock-also-positive-coronavirus","story":"Matt Hancock took to social media this afternoon to announce he has tested positive for the virus, just hours after Boris Johnson also revealed he had contracted the infection.:Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirusIn a video from what appeared to be his home office, he said: \"Ive been working from home for the last couple of days, as everybody who can work from home should work from home.Following medical advice, I was advised to test for #Coronavirus.Ilsquove tested positive.

He is a convinced Unionist and his book has been enthusiastically endorsed by academics and politicians of the same persuasion. The subtitle leaves the reader in little doubt about the overall thrust of the volume.The Nationalist perspective has long been articulated in websites, podcasts and books but reasoned contributions from Unionists remain few and far between. This is one reason why, behind the banner headlines and the rampant prejudices surfacing in social media, there has been very little compelling intellectual debate of the cut and thrust iety on the pros and cons of independence.This is a pity given that the polls tell us there is now apparently a majority in favour of secession from the Union. It is therefore all the more urgent that all aspects of a future decision are widely and seriously discussed and the clash of dferent ideas and opinions heard across the land. If Lloydrsquos polemic triggers thoughtful and considered reactions from both Nationalists and Unionists it will, for that reason alone, have been a welcome publication.There is certainly much meat for others to chew on in the authorrsquos unambiguous contentions. His thesis is that leaving the Anglo-Scottish union for an uncertain future in the EU has the makings of an utter disaster for the country. The removal of the large lsquosubsidyrsquo from the UK Treasury will have a devastating impact on the resourcing of public services. There will be lsquohuge dislocationsrsquo during the years spent unravelling a union which has endured for four centuries. These will make the pains of the Brexit process seem very superficial by comparison.lsquoIndependence in Europersquo will mean the country has turned its back on England, by far its biggest market, for the continent with which trade is relatively small by comparison and where it will have no choice but to become part of the Eurozone. Scotland, as a small, economically and financially precarious new statersquo will then be like flotsam tossed on the waves of global forcesrsquo. The large deficit on the public finances from Independence Day could also mean that the nation will fail in the short term to meet the fiscal tests for entry to the EU. There could then be a period of uncertain duration when Scotland would be both outside the Union with England and the anticipated new union with the EU. At least for an indeterminate number of years, the country, in Lloydrsquos baleful scenario, will face unprecedented fiscal challenges and the austerity which will inevitably follow for its citizens. Leaving Tory-dominated England and a post-Brexit UK might have a strong emotional allure but it is too grave a risk by far.Manynot most Nationalist voters reading this synopsis will dismiss Lloydrsquos views as nothing other than predictable Unionist pessimism, based on myth and half truths, a stale reheating of the essences of Project Fear which worked in  and could do so again in a future referendum. They, and especially the Scottish Government, would be unwise to take that cavalier attitude. Lloyd, speaks for many Unionist voters who currently account for around half of the electorate. Whatever the intellectual credibility of his views, they appeal to very substantial numbers of the citizenry of a nation fractured down the middle on the most important constitutional question it has faced since .Moreover, the arguments which underpin Lloydrsquos book will again frame the Unionist case in favour of the status quo.Those who favour independence will have to develop a cogent riposte to them. Unlike those of  the answers will have to be honest, calibrated and taking full and careful account of hard evidencethey are to convince or at least be given a respectful hearing by others. The issues which bear on a post-independence Scotland are huge: the currency, economic planning, management of the deficit, economic relations with England, discussions with the EU, nuclear arms on the Clyde, to name just the some of the most obvious. So far the public know little of the Scottish Governmentrsquos current thinking on any of them.There is also the even more urgent matter of current domestic policies and administration. For some time the SNP has attracted a positive press for its perceived competence in office. That reputation, especially in school education and the health services, is now widely acknowledged to be fraying more than somewhat. The credentials for running an independent country will be seen by the public as based on the record of managing an devolved authority. Improvement in that respect needs to be introduced before another referendum is called.In the first part of his book, therefore, John Lloyd raises some interesting issues. But the remaining chapters are more problematic. He advances, for example, the eccentric idea that the Scots-born living in England should be allowed a vote on independence. This notion would be in direct conflict with the SNP opposition to lsquoblood and soil nationalismrsquo and invalidate that of the preferred lsquocivic nationalismrsquo which Lloyd himself praises where in the book. Even more bizarre is the proposal that the citizens of England and Wales as well as Scots ought to be able to have a say in a referendum. I cannot imagine that being met with acclaim in the corridors of Holyrood, though given some recent polling data from south of the border, it might indeed,adopted, help to seal the end of the Union.Analytically, the most disappointing part of the volume is the explanations given for the growth of Scottish nationalism in the last  years or so. As the popularity of the Tories went into terminal decline, the main party political bulwark of the Union was Labour. It, too, however, eventually succumbed to both internal and external weakness and soon collapsed into electoral irrelevance. The breakthrough of the SNP could not have happened without the demise of Scottish Labour. It is an issue to understanding the travails of the Union but it attracts only cursory coverage in this book.Instead, much is made about how nationalism is grounded on long term hatred of all things English with the poet, Hugh MacDiarmid, portrayed as the founding father and cheerleader of this ethnic animosity. Certainly, in the past the charge is proven but it has much less purchase in the ranks of the modern SNP. Anglophobia,it exists on any scale, has not impeded the continuing increase in English migration to Scotland in recent decades. Today the English-born are by far the countryrsquos biggest minority, with more than half a million recorded in the last national census. Academic research confirms they rarely encounter antagonism because of their background. When it was revealed that a clear majority of English-born had voted No in the  referendum, there was no evidence of a crisis of Anglophobia. The SNP maintained a studied silence on the issue and even scurrilous comments in social media were few and far between.Lloyd would have been better advised to focus on the history of governance within the British state in the search for a convincing explanation of the popularity of nationalism today.Indeed, scholars describe the th and early th centuries as an era of lsquosemi-independencersquo ,when the UK government had sovereign authority but most of the business of running Scotland actually took place north of the border through the law, burgh councils and a range of public agencies. The Union came close to being a partnership union of mutual respect and that equilibrium, together with domestic and imperial economic advantage, ensured the association of two historic nations remained virtually unchallenged until the s.That condition of mutual respect disintegrated due to the Westminster folly of centralisation, interference and reckless insensitivity in Scottish affairs. Ironically, therefore, it was not rabid Nationalists who began to destabilise the Union but s of the British state in London."},{"url":null,"title":"chic-murray","story":"BODY Coach Joe Wicks has been live-streaming exercise classes to help cooped-up kids keep fit.

At Fridayrsquos lunchtime briefing the First Minister announced additional funding for mental health and additional advice on the NHS Scotland website. This is exactly what a nimble government should be capable of doing and illustrates my point precisely.While commendable, I fear that the call for volunteers on the scale of NHS England could well prove too cumbersome to move quickly and may grind under its own inertia. The Scottish Government has indicated that it will support health boards in running their own volunteer networks. Having had some experience in drafting a Bird Flu pandemic plan in  I can say that this approach fits well with the already-established volunteer networks within each local authority area.On the other hand I agree with the views of Nick Kempeand would similarly cite Taiwan, which to date has had  confirmed cases and only two deaths in a population of . million. I note that its government feels that it is past the worst in this wave. It had learned a great deal from SARS, so it traced and tested those who had travelled from mainland China in the three weeks prior to its first case and followed up by checking those partiesrsquo contacts. There is widespread testing. As a matter of routine since SARS, school and college classes are photographed to be able to trace those who are closest to infected persons should there be an epidemic and they are confined. At the time of the first reports from China those arriving in the country were quarantined for  days. We might object to the state enforcing our movements through mobile phones and merging medical and travel records but, on many other aspects, Taiwan can illustrate the effectiveness of how they have handled this.Your headline mentions a judicial review and I am sure that in time it will be clear that the UK should have closed down much earlier.John C Hutchison, Fort William.IF I may add to your report of shortcomings in the British governments attempts to obtain an adequate supply of hospital ventilators , according toIndustrial Development Authority as reported recently in the Irish media, about half of the ventilators manufactured in the world are made in Ireland, mainly by Medtronic of Galway.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Online therapy part of pound.m of mental health fundingDuring the present Coronavirus crisis the EU is restricting the export of certain kinds of medical devices, a restriction from which the UK is exempt unti the end of the transition period of leaving the EU ndash that is, December .

Following the first COBRA meeting to discuss coronavirus the First Minister felt duty-bound to announce public measures as quickly as possible to the Scottish people. According to some English commentators Ms Sturgeon had no right to do this until Boris Johnson had done it first.Earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon was reprimanded once more by some English journalists unhappy that she insists on referring to Mr Johnson as ldquoBoris rather than ldquoPrime Minister during Cobra meetings. You might have thought that rising daily death tolls the mortal threat to the economy and the prospect of the NHS being overwhelmed are enough to be getting on with. But, no, because ldquoitrsquos lsquoPrime Ministerrsquo to you.Adherence to this convention hasnrsquot stopped some Unionist commentators trying to predict how the movement for independence might be affected first by coronavirus and secondly by the fallout of the Alex Salmond trial. I have no problem with this.The constitutional question has dominated Scottish politics for a generation. Itrsquos entirely reasonable to speculate what the effects of coronavirus will portend for the SNP and its ultimate goal of independence. In light of the expected civil war that is expected to erupt within the SNP and the wider Yes movement following Mr Salmondrsquos trial this national health emergency could provide an opportunity for reflection.:Alex Salmond writing book about his prosecution lsquonightmarersquoThe former First Minister was acquitted on all the charges of sexual assault and attempted rape he was facing and immediately gave notice that he intends to exact a signicant measure of vengeance upon those within the SNP whom he holds responsible for seeking to destroy him. Those of us who have been made aware of some of the evidence ruled inadmissible in the defence case know where this is going.Mr Salmond and his supporters are confident that once this is placed in the public domain ndash almost certainly in the course of two inquiries into the Governmentrsquos role in it ndash that some very senior people may be forced to consider their positions.I have no doubt that Mr Salmond will attempt a political comeback and that this will ultimately involve a tilt at the party leadership. He will feel utterly vindicated by the decision of a jury, which included nine women, to find him innocent of all charges.Few doubt the wisdom of their judgment. A high bar is set for proving guilt in these cases. It became clear from the opening exchanges in the trial that the prosecution would have trouble reaching this standard.In the absence of corroboration or witnesses to the incidents in question the prosecutionrsquos case rested heavily on the Moorov doctrine. This is used to establish a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour. In a case like this, where most of the accusers were known to each other it carries a risk:one or two stitches come undone then the pattern is ruined.Yet, in this case, acquittal does not signy that all the witnesses were lying. Those observers Irsquove spoken with who were present throughout the trial reported that the testimony of most of the complainants seemed sincere and heartfelt. It becomes troubling when bystanders, especially men, seek to cast aspersions on the quality of a womanrsquos complaint of sexual assault.The passage of a signicant amount of time between an incident occurring and the reporting of it is of little consequence. There are many reasons for making a woman think twice about taking complaints further, not the least of which is the distressingly low number of rape and sexual assault cases that even come to court in Scotland. This, and how their sexual historiesare luridly held up for public inspection.I also become queasy when comparisons are drawn between what might have been acceptable a few years ago and now. Men often justy revelations of predatory behaviour by old celebrities as merely ldquoa product of the s, and thus deemed to be trling or ldquoa footer to borrow a phrase used in Mr Salmondrsquos trial. Yet, most of the men I have known from that era considered such conduct to be just as wrong then as it is now. They would talk of lsquocommon decencyrsquo.:Mark Smith: Believe it or not ndash the Alex Salmond trial could change us all for the betterAnd yet, on the evidence, the jury did come to the right decision. These incidents, some of which Mr Salmond and his legal team admitted were inappropriate, did not amount to criminality in the law. He is innocent and thus free to pursue a political career as an innocent man.However, as coronavirus advances towards summer I would urge Mr Salmond to take the opportunity it provides for self-reflection. He canrsquot escape from this truth: he wouldnrsquot have found himself in the dockhis conduct had always been of the standard we expect of a national leader.If wersquore talking about the high bar thatrsquos set to prove criminality then we must also discuss the high bar we set for those who seek public office. If Mr Salmond doesto front-line politics he and those closest to him must first considerthe Scottish people feel he can reach that gold standard in light of all the evidence led at his trial.I would urge Mr Salmond to think again about seeking revenge for his ordeal and tipping the cause he loves into a state of ruinous civil stre. The opponents of independence even now are salivating at such a prospect.This is not a time for vengeance but a time for healing. I would like him to express contrition for those times his conduct fell below that which we expect in high office and to seek to bring about peace and reconciliation. These, more than strength and clarity of purpose, are the characteristics of a true leader. They are also the mark of a better man."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-alister-jack-becomes-third-uk-cabinet-member-self-isolate","story":"The Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack, issaid to be experiencing \"mild\" symptoms, including a cough and a temperature, but has not been tested for Covid-.He said in a statement: \"In the past  hours, I have developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus.Mr Jack added: \"In line with medical guidance, I am self-isolating and working from home.\"His announcement comes after the prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Friday thatthey had tested positivefor Covid-.

And some concern has been voiced that the payments are not due to begin until June.One person worried about the future is Julie Leith, who started a cleaning business Shetland Cleaning Crew four years ago. Her sister Tracey joined the enterprise last year. Four people work for the business altogether.Despite the uncertainty, she is determined to hang on, despite having had to suspend work because of the lockdown. She is also anxious to protect her clients and her two young daughters.“Things are kind of tricky at the moment. They’ve come out with a package saying they will help, but as far as I’m aware it’ll not be available until June,# she said.“I was relieved there was going to be something in place, but by June I don’t kenI’ll still be able to trade. It’s very up in the air at the moment.”Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. Ms Leith said she was unable to work because most of her clients were senior citizens, “and I’m not classed as an essential worker”.“I’ve had to down tools to protect all of my elderly clients, and the lasses.”She has noticed a certain irony in having to cancel cleaning jobs at a time when cleaning is considered to be important in order to hold the virus off.“Once the lockdown had come everybody said ‘wait until the lockdown is over’ and we’ll reschedule the clean. Weirdly, the cleaning has dried up and that’s most important.”Ms Leith said she was avoiding news bulletins after becoming so concerned about the pandemic. But she said she was determined to hold on until June when her business may get the support it needs from the government.“I’m positive we will,” she said. “There are some days where I think we won’t, but I’m trying to stay positive.”Meanwhile a taxi driver, who did not wish to be named, said he had been able to secure Universal Credit, which he believed that would cover rent and council tax, but very little . His business, he said, had been able to stay open “but it is really what you might call bread and milk money”.The driver added he was not hopeful about the new support being offered, and added he had taken out a finance package on a new car in January, before adding the economic downfall could not have happened at a worse time.Painter and decorator Fearghas Noblett was dwelling on the positives. His work has disappeared but he said he believed he and his we Myra could could survive until June when he will hopefully qualy for a share of the government support.“It’s a relief that something is in place and compared to a lot of countries we are very, very fortunate to be living in such a democratic time that the government will think of doing that,” he said.He added he had stopped working despite being initially tempted to carry on.“I was told that the police have details of everybody’s vehicles and are monitoring those people who would be tempted to go out and work.“Initially I was. It’s like you feel part of the French Resistance # you’ve got to keep on doing what you do.“It was ambiguous, where they were saying ‘ you can’t work from home you need to go to work,’ but the goalposts changed quite rapidly.“We can’t be seen to just be carrying on because that’s quite a selfish thing to do.“From my point of view it would definitely be wrong for me to sneak around and think I could work..”He said he believed he could get by until June.“We have other income, Myra’s working. It’s not disastrous for us. When this is all blown over I’ve still got a job to go to.”Mr Carmichael welcomed the announcement, but indicated they could have gone further.“MPs of all parties have been highlighting the lack of support for self-employed people for some days and I am glad that the government is starting to catch up,” he said.“As I put it to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, self-employed people are not looking for special treatment but for equal treatment with employed people. The measures today seem to go some way towards that.“There are, however, still large gaps in the support for self-employed people. The wait until June will be extremely challenging for many, especially with the reluctance of many banks to offer bridging loans currently.“Tourism, which makes up such a vital part of the local economy in the isles, is obviously highly seasonal and yet this is not recognised in the Chancellor’s plan.“Three months of government support based on an ‘annual average’ will not paper over the financial hole faced by those who rely on the usual summer trade to cover them through the rest of the year.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"wilma named as shetland wool week patron ","story":"This years Shetland Wool Week patron Wilma Malcolmson.The Shetland Wool Week patron for this year was named today as knitwear designer Wilma Malcolmson, who is internationally renowned for her skilfully blended Fair Isle knitwear.The much-anticipated annual hat pattern, which is now synonymous with the launch of the patron, has also been released. This year’s official hat, designed by her, is called #Katie’s Kep#.The wool week organisers said they were delighted to have Mrs Malcolmson as this year’s patron. She was a key player in the local knitting community, a wool week and Shetland Peerie Makker tutor, and also one of Shetland’s most influential and innovative designers.She has lived in Shetland all her le and, like many others who grew up in the isles, has knitted from childhood. Originally from Garderhouse on the West Side, she later moved to Cunningsburgh where she lived with her late husband Leonard.She established her business, Shetland Designer, in  and during that time she has seen her creations reach all four corners of the world.Mrs Malcolmson said: “I am touched and honoured to be this year’s patron. Wool week is a wonderful event that helps to bring people, not just knitters, from all around the world together.#To me, the festival represents a time of friendship, of learning from each other and an appreciation of our islands and way of le as it celebrates old and new by putting traditional patterns and techniques on equal terms with new, innovative ones.#The hat is the common bond for us all and I am delighted to have been asked to design it and become part of the wool week story.“My hat ‘Katie’s Kep’ is named after my mother Katie. It includes the patterns that she taught me when I was a peerie lass because they were her favourites. She belonged to that large group of professional knitters, without whom our Shetland colour work and lace heritage might not have been as alive and vibrant as it is today. This is my tribute to all the known and unknown designer artists of Shetland throughout the centuries.”On her love of knitting, Mrs Malcolmson said: “My mother instilled in me an interest in patterns and colours, from her I learned the importance of contrast and ‘blending’. Colour inspiration is all around us in Shetland – you only need to look at the rugged landscape, seashores the ever-changing skies to find shades that work together.”She has created four very dferent colourways for the hat using yarn from Jamieson’s of Shetland, Jamieson and Smith, Uradale Yarns and Shetland Handspun.Each company has prepared yarn kits and are available to take back orders online, but are currently unable to guarantee specic delivery dates. Customers are urged to keep an eye on the respective websites for updates.The organisers said: “We are always thrilled to announce the new patron and hat, and perhaps even more so this year. Throughout this ongoing global crisis we have received many requests urging us to release the hat pattern and we are pleased to be able to make it available, as always, as a free download from our Shetland Wool Week website.#We hope it will bring some welcome light relief and focus as well as a sense of connection for all our supporters.”#Katie#s Kep# – this year#s official wool week hat.Mrs Malcolmson added: #I really do feel that this is in the interest of knitters. Under these strange times we are living in there are so many knitters around the world taking comfort from their work and enjoying their knitting when they are self-isolating.#Knitting has been so important to Shetland all through the years. When I grew up the knitters around me were knitting to help the economy, to put food on the table. It wasn#t a hobby at that time.#The th Shetland Wool Week is due to run from th September and already a huge amount of effort has gone into preparing for the event. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the event remains under review.• An extensive question and answer interview with Mrs Malcolmson is available to read via the Shetland Wool Week newsletter and website.

To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention.

Although the advice is that people should remain two metres apart, crowds have been assembling in the face of the growing Covid- threat. Retired senior RUC and British army figures with long experience of, ah, public order have been employed as consultants to advise the forces of law and order on how best to deploy the Spirit of Northern Ireland during times of public non-compliance. Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons.

Those out walking or driving while Irish should be aware that some names may lead to certain complications in your dealings with the RUC – sorry, PSNI – and the British army. Again, younger people should consult with parents grandparents on how to address this tricky problem, butthey advise you to pretend you’re called Norman or Pamela, be aware that society has changed considerably in the quarter of a century-plus since the ceasefires and you are probably best placed to pick your own non-Irish name.

In Northern Ireland, broken down by council district area, Belfast has the highest number of confirmed cases at , according to the latest available data provided by the PHA.The second highest area is Lisburn and Castlereagh with . Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon is placed third highest , followed by North Down and Ardsand Antrim and Newtownabbey in fth place with .Sixth is Fermanagh and Omagh , narrowly followed by Mid and East Antrim and Newry, Mourne and Down with both each having  confirmed cases, placing them joint seventh.Ninth is Derry and Strabane with nine cases, with Mid Ulster and Causeway ranking th and th with seven and five cases respectively. There are also seven cases where the location is unknown.Separate analysis of data, meanwhile, shows coronavirus is most prevalent in Lisburn and Castlereagh , followed by Belfastand Ards and North Down .Outlining his analysis of the PHA geographical spread of coronavirus, Dr Bamford insisted the graphic data fits with how a virus spreads among a population.He told the Belfastit was not surprising areas like Belfast, and Lisburn and Castlereagh, were recording as virus hotspots.It is what you would expect. Those are the areas with the most people, so that#s why there are more cases, explained Dr Bamford.There#s more cases in Belfast because it#s more connected. There#s also a lot of testing areas in the east [of the region].He also warned that actual numbers of people here contracting the virus are likely to be much higher than recorded cases, due to low testing numbers.This [PHA graphic] is based on the number of confirmed cases, and we know that there is going to be at least  times the number of known cases.However, he stressed the numbers could accurately reflect the spread of Covid- across Northern Ireland.These number of cases will reflect the percentage of a total, but they will maybe accurately reflect the picture, said Dr Bamford.Noting the lower number of confirmed cases, largely located in the west of Northern Ireland - indicated on the PHA graphic as white or light pink - the virologist emphasised that council areas with the lowest recorded cases should not be drawn into a  sense of security.Nowhere is safe. If we left this [fight against coronavirus where it is] and didn#t do anything, Derry and Strabane would [go darker on the map] as well as Mid Ulster, he insisted.We#re dealing with a small number of confirmed cases the dference between Derry and Strabane and Mid Ulster [changing from white to pink on the map], for example, could only be a single confirmed case, he insisted.The expert also cautioned against Northern Ireland overall descending into complacency as the lockdown continues.Northern Ireland as a whole is a couple of weeks behind the rest of the UK, even England and London. But we have the potential to reach those numbers and that kind of situationwe ignore the seriousness of coronavirus, said the virologist.Authorities here are making preparations in anticipation of a surge in cases. Work is under way to establish large, temporary field hospitals for coronavirus patients after modelling indicated that the current health service network in Northern Ireland may not have the capacity to cope at the peak of the outbreak.

Her husband Paddy said the dficulties brought on by coronavirus have been the toughest part of their hospice journey. Our children and grandchildren are unable to visit following all the regulations to protect the vulnerable in our society, he explained. Of course, they just want to see their mummy and nanny. However, they know that what they are doing by distancing themselves is vital to the health of Kate and other patients.But he stressed this didn#t stop their children and grandchildren from pulling out all the stops to make Mother#s Day special.Our son Aidan and his we brought their four children down to see their nanny - and although it was looking through a window holding up a #Happy Mother#s Day# sign, it most definitely helped make the day that much easier, revealed Paddy. Our daughter Roisin also arrived with a little bag of essentials, waving and smiling through the window, and even that little bit of interaction put a big smile on Kate#s face.Aidan , who is an artist, has decided to show his appreciation to Marie Curie by raffling off one of his own paintings.To donate to the hospice, visit mariecurie.org.uk emergency Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: NI petrol prices fall below £ as lockdown keeps drivers at homeWatch: Mother and son play bagpipes at Spelga Dam in NHS tribute Motorists urged not to speed on open roads after death of cyclistTributes as inspirational Armagh teen photographer loses battle with cancerViable pipe bomb left outside west Belfast home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Google  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLagmore Grove in west Belfast. Credit: Google March   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA viable pipe bomb device was left outside a west Belfast home on Friday night. The device being left outside a home in the Lagmore Grove area.Police attended the scene around pm and sealed the area off while the device was dealt with.Due to the coronavirus health crisis the occupant and their neighbours were advised not to leave their homes, but instead to remain at the back of their properties while Army Technical Officers made the device safe. The device was taken away for further examination and police said it contained component parts which, had the device been detonated, would have made it viable..Police are working to establish a motive and the circumstances surrounding the incident, and identy who is responsible.  Lord Mayor of Belfast Daniel Baker asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police. This was a senseless act and shows little regard for the community, our key workers, emergency services and health workers, the local Sinn Fein councillor said. “I appeal for anyone on any information to bring it forward to the PSNI.Councillor Baker said the incident was particularly unwelcome as communities are dealing with the coronavirus outbreak“These reckless actions are in stark contrast to the efforts of workers carrying out essential work, he said.“Those responsible offer nothing only disrupting the efforts of our emergency services to help those in most need at this time of crisis.Our key workers are already under immense pressure as they work whilst the rest of us remain home in our battle against COVID-.”PSNI Chief Inspector Gary Reid said those responsible have no respect, or regard, for the valuable police resources that were erted away from other community priorities. It beggars belief, that given the unprecedented challenges we, as a Police Service, face in relation to the Covid- pandemic that there are still reckless iniduals out there determined to put the lives of others at risk as they did last night in Lagmore Grove, he said. This is already a stressful and worrying time for people so,ever there was a time for this type of senseless activity to stop, it is now.“I am appealing to anyone who has any information which can lead us to those responsible to please call us on , and quote reference number  of    or Crimestoppers   .

I want to commend the community led volunteer responses that are mobilising right across the City and District. Its heartening to see so many people come forward to assist the wellbeing of their neighbours and communities during this time. These services will come under increasing pressure in the coming months so I want to ask that everyone who is fit to do so considers offering their helpthey can.This is a rapidly changing situation and as a Council will continue to be proactive and to work with all our partner agencies and organisations to support local people and ensure they have the information, services and assistance they need to stay safe, well and adequately provided for through the very challenging times ahead.At the meeting members discussed the possible delivery mechanisms for the effective allocation of resources, as well as the governance and coordination required to support the local community and voluntary sector.It was agreed that Council would advance with the necessary governance arrangements in place to deliver annually agreed support to these services. This will include committing funds to support service level agreements and an extension of the community venues funds which have been in place for the last three years to ensure core costs will be in place to continue services.Council officers will contact impacted groups directly with letters of offer and advance payments as quickly as possible.An additional joint funding package is also being developed with the Department for Communities to support the continuation of the advice tribunal service, increasing telephone capacity and extending working hours. Council is hopeful that this investment will be confirmed shortly.During the meeting Council members paid tribute to local service providers Advice North West, Dove House and Resource Centre Derry and the work they are doing reaching out to the community under growing pressure, and stressed the importance of stepping up assistance at this stage.Councillors strongly welcomed these and other measures put forward, and agreed to further review demands on services and to lobby government for the necessary financial support to maintain and strengthen community services as needed to respond to the ongoing COVID emergency.A spokesperson for the three local service providers welcomed the news, saying: We are delighted that these resources are being made available. Demand has been unprecedented and our staff have been working around the clock to meet the needs of local people who are naturally very concerned for the welfare of themselves and loved ones at this time.We will channel this support into the effective delivery of services and supporting our staff throughout this crisis.The full report from todays meeting is available to view now athttps:bit.ly xnnvv googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

It might be that % of the UK already has coronavirus, , in UK and , in Northern Ireland, and perhaps many times more, but with a lower fatality rate than expected.

As anyone who has been to sub Saharan Africa will know, the health systems cannot cope with disease and poverty in normal times, and certainly won’t be able to do sothe pandemic takes hold.But amidst all the gloom it is good to retain perspective and to be aware of glimmers of hope.The death toll in the UK as a whole will probably rise by a magnitude of hundreds more fatalities each day in the coming week.When that happens the clamour for further factory closures and restrictions will grow ever louder.But some statistics suggest the present trajectory of ultimate deaths might lead to the UK outcome being at the lower end ofprojections, which range from , deaths to ,. Some models even have the UK coming in well under , deaths and closer to annual seasonal flu deaths.The NHS, while under immense pressure, particularly in the capital, is not yet as hard hit as some experts had feared at this stage.Coronavirus has clearly penetrated Europe and America to a large extent. This might sound like further bad news but might not beit is evidence that a much larger number of people than we realise are already infected, with perhaps a lower percentage death toll than the % that had been expected.The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt recently suggested there might be , infections for each reported death .Using this rule of thumb, the UK is already approaching a million infections. It might even have several million cases. Anecdotal evidence for widespread infection is strong.Consider the famous people known to have it. There are not that many famous people —look up at the top of the opposite page: every day newspapers run such daily lists of famous people’s birthdays. Most of us have become familiar with the famous people who share our own birthday. Some are names we know well, but often there are names on the list we do not know.Most people will know on average at most seven or eight names a day, which suggests that we all have in our head perhaps , famous names .Yet already a notable number of that small pool of people is infected.Even before Boris Johnson and Prince Charles got Covid-, the list of famous names who have it was getting ever bigger and included Prince Albert II of Monaco, the EU leader Michel Barnier, the actors Tom Hanks, Idris Elba, Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta,model Linda Lusardi, GMTV star Fiona Phillips, among others.Celebrities such as this are a random group of people: there is no obvious reason why they would be more likely to get it than others.Similarly most of us know, personally, a relatively small number of people, probably measured in the hundreds rather than thousands , yet more and more of us know someone who has it. I know of five such people .In addition to people we know who have it, there will be others we know who do but of whose infection we have not yet learned of, and others still we know who are symptomless and do not know themselves.So it is not at all hard to believe that at least % of the population on these islands already has itand perhaps many times that number.That the NHS is coping at this stage is an encouraging indicator of outcomes .Last night for an update I talked to a local expert, Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP Committee of BMA for NI, who wrote for us recently on the importance of not moving too early on things such as school closures. He said: “The projection is that every hospital and ICU bed in two weeks time will be full. “The speed of the spread is slower than we initially feared, which we think is due to the restrictions that have been introduced, so there is no room whatsoever for complacency. “What people do know will dictate where we are one or two weeks from now.”So lockdowns remain essential. But they are causing vast economic damage that will ruin lives around the world and while we must guard against complacency in this crisis, we must also be ready to begin to relax restrictions at the first moment data suggests it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor"},{"url":null,"title":"postponed historic passion play goes back vow made  ","story":"Coronavirus: Latest map showing spread across Northern Ireland – with more young than old infected – as deaths hit double-digitsCoronavirus: Latest map of the hotspots for the virus in Northern Ireland shows rate of expansion in a single dayNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsPostponed historic Passion Play goes back to a vow made in Almost lost in the current barrage of closures, cancellations and postponements in every sphere of le, an announcement on March  resonated with the poignant irony of history.By The RoamerThursday, th March , : pm\"\"Jesus Christ and John.  Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
