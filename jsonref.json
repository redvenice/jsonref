Once a would-be model with high cheekbones and pouty lips, Magnotta had become obsessed with Hollywood, dedicating his life to pursuing stardom.Failing to find success in the fashion world, he became a stripper, appeared in gay porn videos and posted thousands of clearly photoshopped images of himself leading a jet-set lifestyle in glamorous locations around the world.Hungry for fame, Magnotta had set up at least 70 Facebook pages and 20 websites under different names, which he used to plant rumours about himself, including that he was in a relationship with a high-profile convicted murderer.But as the Facebook investigators closed in on their target, something else was starting to happen: Magnotta seemed to be feeding off the notoriety he was gaining. And as the focus upon him intensified, so his actions grew more extreme.Indeed, his next move was to release two further videos of him killing kittens – one fed to a python and the other drowned in a bath while tied to the end of a pole.Then, revelling in the attention, Magnotta apparently confirmed to those hunting him that he was indeed the killer. Now Deanna feared that he might pose a threat to people, too.It is well known that some psychopaths kill animals before moving on to murder people, and in Deanna’s view it was a race against time to bring him to justice.This was chillingly confirmed when Magnotta sent her a video taken as she walked through her place of work. ‘I know who you are and I know where you work,’ Magnotta tells Deanna on the clip. Her own life was at risk.         Stabbed to death: Jun Lin was attacked by Luka Magnotta with a screwdriver. ‘The more I read about Jun Lin, it hit me so hard that I’d worked 18 months to get this person stopped, and then he committed murder,’ Deanna said laterThe Facebook sleuths begged Magnotta to seek help, but to no avail. They made several attempts to pass their vast cache of evidence to Canadian police but heard nothing back – until their worst fears proved correct.In 2012, Magnotta posted a new video, entitled 1 Lunatic, 1 Ice Pick. It showed a blurred figure stabbing a naked man 100 times with a screwdriver. The killer had moved on to humans. The screwdriver was painted silver, which it was later discovered had been to make it look like the ice pick used by Sharon Stone’s character in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct.A torso was found in a suitcase outside Magnotta’s apartment in Montreal, along with binbags stained with blood, a dead puppy and Magnotta’s ID. Any remaining doubts were dismissed when it turned out that Magnotta had been caught on CCTV casually disposing of the items and – such was his narcissism – checking his reflection on the way back into the building.Viewers are told that Magnotta dismembered the corpse – although it is not clear how – and that he sent various body parts to the headquarters of Canada’s two leading political parties.The killing of 33-year-old Jun Lin, a Chinese engineering student, had a devastating effect on Deanna. For all her efforts, she had been powerless to help.‘The more I read about Jun Lin, it hit me so hard that I’d worked 18 months to get this person stopped, and then he committed murder,’ she said later.Finally, Canadian police were obliged to act, sending Magnotta’s details to forces around the world, and he was apprehended in Berlin on June 4, 2012, in an internet cafe. The owner recognised Magnotta from newspaper reports and flagged down a passing officer.Magnotta had been looking up his own mugshot on the Interpol website at the time.So reviled was the murderer that no airline company would fly him back to Montreal and a plane from the Royal Canadian Air Force had to be used instead. Magnotta\u0027s lawyers claimed he was schizophrenic but the prosecution argued that he had faked the condition and, instead, suffered borderline personality disorder.In December 2014, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.Whatever the truth about his mental state, he showed little or no emotion when confronted with his crimes. ‘You see him being given a photo of Jun Lin and he doesn’t even react,’ says director Mark Lewis. ‘He was far more focused on making it clear to people that he had been a model and an actor.’Deeply conflicted about the role they played in trying to track down Magnotta, Deanna and her group of online crusaders were initially wary about taking part in the Netflix documentary.They were haunted that Magnotta might not have resorted to murder had they not provided the very audience he seemed to crave.‘One of the things which keeps me up sometimes at night is, were we complicit in his crimes?’ she asks. ‘Maybe I did exactly what the killer wanted. These people don’t deserve our attention.‘There are so many people in society loving true crime and serial killer documentaries. Every killer has fans.‘People write to these guys in prison. It’s insane. I am guilty of that as well. I watch these documentaries. I’m in one now.’Deanna’s campaign is far from over. Her group has launched an online organisation which seeks to alert local authorities to animal abusers and has played a role in a number of successful arrests.In the final moments of the documentary, however, she poses a troubling question about our ever-increasing fascination with true crime.‘You at home, watching a whole documentary about Luka Magnotta – are you complicit?’ she asks, before concluding: ‘Perhaps it’s time we turned off the machine.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/24/11/23817324-0-image-a-11_1579864082344.jpg","title":"Boeings new 777X airliner takes flight","story":"Share this article   The factory for the plane, in Everett, is big enough to fit 25 football fields inside. \u0027Building on the success of the 777 and 787 Dreamliner, the 777X will be the largest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the world, unmatched in every aspect of performance,\u0027 Boeing says.\u0027However, performance is just part of the story. \u0027The cabin interior of the 777X is inspired by the comforts and conveniences of the 787 Dreamliner and includes larger windows, a wider cabin, new lighting and enhanced architecture — all of which will be custom-tailored for a unique 777X experience. \u0027The 777X is the future of flight unfolding. \u0027That\u0027s a better way to fly.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Adorable moment newborn joey named Dorito takes steps Australia Day","story":"Share this article The Yellow-footed rock wallaby, formerly the ring-tailed wallaby, grows on average to about 60cm tall and weighs 11 kilograms. It is found in small areas of western New South Wales and eastern South Australia and in smaller numbers in Queensland. The marsupial prefers rough terrain and rock outcroppings rather than grasslands. The species is listed as \u0027near threatened\u0027 after its numbers were reduced due to hunting, however, conservation efforts have managed to keep their population stable.          The Yellow-footed rock wallaby, formerly the ring-tailed wallaby, grows on average to about 60cm tall and weighs 11 kilograms  "},{"url":null,"title":"Head Sheffield cheap date People Steel City spend 29 dinner drinks","story":"Share this article Younger daters tried to impress more than older romantics, with those aged between 18 and 24 spending an average of £69 on a date. Those aged over 55 paid just £35.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Household Cavalry troops moonlighting paid fox hunt security guards 20 000 deal","story":"Share this article          Troops from the Household Cavalry have been moonlighting as paid security guards protecting a trail hunt from animal rights activists, The Mail on Sunday can revealIn 2011, two Fernie hunt employees were fined thousands of pounds after being found guilty of digging out a fox hiding in a badger sett so it could then be chased by hounds.Fox-hunting has been banned since 2004 and has been replaced by trail hunting, which involves people on foot or horseback following a scent along a pre-determined route with hounds or beagles. Campaigners claim it still allows illegal hunting of foxes, deer and other animals with dogs. Last night, the MoD refused to say how many soldiers were present at the hunt, or how much they were paid. An Army spokesman said: ‘Service personnel can undertake secondary civilian employment with the approval of their chain of command.’The Fernie hunt said: ‘We do not have anything to do with the recruiting of the iniduals themselves.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b340fd1bb04504e7343a602c12abe23df145d1b/204_449_4310_2586/master/4310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdd11b5817791d7bf0a45de07a99c63d","title":"buy your own guardian classic photograph an antony gormley statue merseyside","story":"This week’s photograph in our weekly archive print series is of the first of Antony Gormley’s statues at Crosby, Merseyside, taken by Don McPheeIn June 2005, the artist Antony Gormley installed the first of 100 eerie, cast iron figures on Crosby Beach in Merseyside, modelled on the sculptor’s own body.  photographer Don McPhee, who was based in Manchester, was there to capture the moment.

As a result, he was hired by Tina Brown as Tatler’s society photographer, with an insider’s eye for the edge between observation and satire. When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit Vanity Fair, Jones moved too, in 1988.Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph Vanity Fair’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna. Jagger was on his own again and looked miserable.”For whatever reason, the magazine did not use the picture – perhaps it did not want to advertise its own party as the place where Mick Jagger had no mates – but it was part of a selection of Vanity Fair photos for the National Portrait Gallery, and is included in a new exhibition of Jones’s work at the Leica Gallery.

NSW Health said on Sunday afternoon a fourth person had tested positive, according to their preliminary test results, though more follow-up was needed.Three men are in hospital in Sydney after flying in from China, while another man in his 50s is being treated in Melbourne.Coronavirus has killed 56 people in China and the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the illness, remains in lockdown. Almost 2,000 people have been infected with the virus in China, and cases have been also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Malaysia and the United States.“I would not be surprised if there are some more cases ... it’s highly likely that we may see them some more.“We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.”Meanwhile, the Australian government is exploring options to evacuate Australian nationals stuck inside the locked down areas of China, around Wuhan city in central Hubei province.The foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her department was “working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions”.“Given the circumstances of the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers.”Removing Australian citizens from cities that are under an effective lockdown, enforced by the military, is a logistical challenge.There are checkpoints surrounding cities such as Wuhan, but whether exceptions are being made for foreign nationals, or on other grounds, is unclear. People brought out of sequestered areas would likely need to be quarantined somewhere else.The US and France have already announced plans to evacuate their citizens. The US is flying a charter flight from Wuhan to San Francisco bringing its diplomats and other consular personnel out of the country. It has said it will have “limited capacity” for private US citizens, and will prioritise those at “greater risk” from the illness.French automaker PSA Group says it will evacuate its employees and their families from Wuhan in central China, quarantine them in another major Chinese city and then bring them back to France.The foreign ministry said French officials were studying “eventual options” for all its nationals to leave if they wish.Two of the men hospitalised in Sydney flew directly from Wuhan, a 53-year-old on 20 January and a 43-year-old two days prior. The third man, aged 35, arrived from the southern city of Shenzhen on 6 January.A fourth, also aged in his 50s, was Australia’s first confirmed case of the virus after he touched down in Melbourne from Guangzhou on 19 January.

The Observer’s past picks have included Sally Rooney and Jessie Burton – who among this year’s crop will make it big?Spring is a time for new beginnings in the books world, especially when it comes to fiction – not so much for established authors, who tend to unveil their new work in the autumn, as for fiction debutants hoping to become the next Sally Rooney or Jessie Burton.For the seventh year running the Observer New Review has chosen a select group of first-time British novelists we believe will make their mark. Our selection procedure was rigorous, with all eligible novels being scrutinised for readability and literary merit by a handful of editors on the New Review. And the class of 2020 looks particularly promising. Among those who made the grade were a poet, a journalist, a former teacher and an actor. The subjects they take on range from modern love in Hong Kong, child kidnapping in India and the Japanese marriage breakup industry to life inside Glasgow’s gangland and murder in a women’s refuge.What makes us so sure these new writers will stand out from the crowd? Our track record speaks for itself. Former New Review debut novelists include both Rooney and Burton, Gail Honeyman, Emma Healey, Oynikan Braithwaite and Sara Collins, winner of this year’s Costa debut novel award. Interestingly, two of our chosen writers are Irish, demonstrating that the exciting new wave of Irish writing kicked off by authors such as Rooney and Booker prizewinner Anna Burns is no flash in the pan. And having called in recent years for publishers to address the scarcity of new black and minority ethnic writers, we are delighted to present our most erse group of first-time authors yet, with four BAME writers out of the 10. Only two are men. Does this mean the days of the Great White Male Author are numbered? We shall see.They say write what you know – and 37-year-old Paul Mendez had plenty of material to draw on for his first novel, Rainbow Milk. Like his protagonist, Jesse, Mendez was raised in the Black Country as a Jehovah’s Witness, and “disfellowshipped” by the group at 17. Like Jesse, Mendez moved to London and became a male escort and sex worker, part of a journey of self-discovery that forms the core of his beautifully assured book.He spent several years transforming his experiences into fiction: “There were times when to write something directly autobiographical would have simply been to bleed my heart out on to the page,” he says. “There are things that happened to me in it, but the details are far different.”Rainbow Milk will be published by Dialogue Books, a Hachette imprint founded in 2017 to publish under-represented voices, headed up by Sharmaine Lovegrove. Mendez had met her at a party in 2012, but it wasn’t until he read about Dialogue that he followed up: “I sent her a sprawling 300-page manuscript on her first day,” he laughs.Mendez lives in Hampstead and is studying for an MA in black British writing at Goldsmiths.What made you want to be a writer?I was raised studying the Bible with adults – and it’s the greatest book ever, right? So my literacy accelerated at a very young age. Books have just always been the thing I’ve never been able to escape words.When did you start writing?I was always encouraged by my English teacher to write, but Witnesses don’t encourage any kind of creative application, so it was a real conflict. I quit an engineering degree in 2002 to write. My family isn’t at all literary and when I told them I had a novel coming out, one uncle asked if I’d had a ghost writer. They’re wonderful people – just very different. They’re still Jehovah’s Witnesses, and they think I’m stupid: I was taught the “truth” and decided to go against that. I’ve tried to give up on them, but I really can’t. They may give up on me after this book comes out – who knows?”What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?I think it’s our great hope! Dialogue Books, Merky Books, Jacaranda Books – all of these imprints are now around, looking for people with different and very valid voices. We’re in a good place.What do you need to work?I need boringness – for nothing to be happening.Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone?It was a fantastic leap of faith on Sharmaine’s part to say “I believe in you, you can write – go away and do it.” I needed someone to do that.What books have inspired you to be a writer?James Baldwin – say no more! And Alan Hollinghurst’s The Line of Beauty: it was one of the things that made me realise I could write through the voice of a gay black protagonist.What books are currently on your bedside table?The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett, Gender Trouble by Judith Butler, and Flèche by Mary Jean Chan.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Keep. Going.What’s the best and worst thing about being a writer?There’s two amazing things: being part of a community of brilliant people, and always having the ability to put your thoughts into words. Therapy is great – but it’s also great to be able to open your laptop and talk to yourself. The worst thing? So far, nothing!Interview by Holly WilliamsAbi Daré, 38, was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where she planned to study French at the local university. Her mum had other ideas and at the end of one summer holiday in the UK Daré found herself “tricked” into staying on to study law at the London campus of the University of Wolverhampton. These days, she’s a proper enough Londoner to have moved out to Essex, but wWhen she first arrived, she chronicled her immigrant experience in a blog that drew hundreds of thousands of hits. In fact, it became so successful she had to delete it because she felt her privacy was being invaded. Aside from the importance of not using your real name online, the blog taught her that she could truly write, so she replaced it with fictional stories shared among friends and family. The Girl With the Louding Voice began as the thesis for her creative writing MA at Birkbeck, University of London, and wound up winning the Bath novel award for emerging authors, before being tussled over in a five-way publisher auction. Its heroine is 14-year-old Adunni, a village girl who longs for an education. Instead, she’s sold into a brutal marriage from which she escapes, only to become trapped as a domestic servant in Lagos, where she’s haunted by her predecessor’s disappearance. To save herself, she must find her “louding” voice. The novel has already been chosen for BBC Radio 2’s Book Club, and Daré hopes it will shine a light on the plight of the real-life Adunnis who continue to be exploited.How did you come to write this book?As a child, I noticed that a lot of families – including mine – had informal housemaids, many of them uneducated and ill-treated, and as young as eight or 10. When my own daughters got to be that age, I found myself wondering whether it was still happening. I read an article about a 13-year-old who had been scalded with boiling water by the woman who employed her, and what really got to me was that her face was a blur in the photograph. It was to protect her identity, but I thought, who is this girl? What’s her story? My book was born out of trying to provide answers.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020 – rude health or room for improvement?It’s come a long way. I’ve gone from not seeing books by authors like myself on the shelves to seeing a lot more but publishing is still not representative enough.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I have a full-time job overseeing app development, so I do a lot on the go. In fact, I’m talking to you from a watch I bought so that I can text myself when I get ideas. I wrote most of The Girl With the Louding Voice in a coffee shop where there was a poster of a girl that the chain’s foundation was supporting. She had the brightest smile, and it felt like she was saying: “Keep going, do it for me!”What do you need to work?I like background noise when I’m writing and being creative, but I like silence to edit so I go to the London Library, where I was given a wonderful scholarship. I also get quite inspired in the shower.What books have inspired you to be a writer?Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s books showed me that if she could do it, I could.What books are currently on your bedside table?A Woman Is No Man by Etaf Rum and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens are both on my Kindle.Are you working on your second book and if so what is it about?I am but it’s at the point where what it’s about changes every day. I never used to be a plotter but I had a disastrous manuscript a few years ago that was 100,000 words of nothing, so I at least need to have an end scene in my mind now.Best and worst things about being a writer?The worst thing is when you’re just not able to get the words out. The best? One is obviously writing a story that I enjoy, another is getting good feedback. When people say “I loved this”, or “Your book opened my eyes”, that beats any feeling. Interview by Hephzibah AndersonAuthor of Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line (Chatto \u0026amp Windus, 30 January)Deepa Anappara grew up in Kerala, India, and worked as a journalist for 12 years, in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi, reporting on the impact of poverty and religious violence on the education of children. She moved to the UK in 2008 and embarked on an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, where she began work on her debut novel, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line. Submitting extracts of the novel to various prizes for unpublished fiction in the hope that a longlisting might help secure her an agent, Anappara went on to win a host of awards including the Lucy Cavendish fiction prize in 2018, which recognises literary merit and “unpoutdownability” and whose previous recipients include Gail Honeyman and Sara Collins. The novel became the subject of a nine-way bidding war and has since sold to 20 international territories and received advance praise from literary figures including Anne Enright and Ian McEwan, a historical novel, as part of her PhD in creative and critical Writing at UEA.What made you want to be a writer?I can’t remember a time when I didn’t want to write. But I come from a background where you’re expected to work for a living so if you sit around making up stuff it’s seen as a luxury and indulgence that you can’t really afford. So I chose journalism because it allowed me to write and also point to the inequities in the society in which I was born and raised.How did you come to write this book?As a reporter in India, I came across stories about the disappearance of children. More than 20 children had gone missing over two or three years and no action had been taken to find them because these people had no money or political power, and they were being ignored by government institutions. My interest was always in the children’s stories: I wondered what it would be like to be a child seeing your friends disappear and be aware you’re in danger yourself.If you had to sell the book in a sentence what would you say?It’s a coming-of-age story about a nine-year-old boy who fancies himself to be a detective and tries to uncover why children are disappearing from his neighbourhood, exploring the impact of a horrific tragedy on a community neglected by the outside world, and the bonds that help people survive difficult times.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?I’d like to see books by more writers of colour and those books get more publicity. I’d like there to be more emphasis on different ways of storytelling. There’s a difference in how stories are told in different countries and we don’t see that variety.What books have inspired you to be a writer?The first writers I read were in my mother tongue Malayalam. Kamala Das and Sarah Joseph showed me that women writers could, and must, write about subjects that were considered taboo in the conservative society in which I grew up. I read VS Naipaul’s A House for Mr Biswas at a time when my parents were struggling to put together the money for their own house, and it was the first time I had seen people like us being represented in fiction in English.What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers?I heard Anne Enright say that the students of hers who got published were those who didn’t give up and that’s really stuck with me. You have to keep working, keep trying, keep persisting.Interview by Hannah BeckermanIrish poet Elaine Feeney’s first novel, As You Were, is set over the course of one week in a chaotic hospital ward – a context rich in both tragedy and comedy. Feeney, who lives in Athenry in west Ireland, has some experience of hospitals, having spent some time in one after complications following the birth of her second son. “The novel went into a completely fictional space, but what I was thinking about was the camaraderie between people who would ordinarily never be together,” she says. Plus, “no one had private rooms, so you hear everything”. Feeney has already published three collections of poetry and has written as many discarded novels. “There was an anxiety around writing a novel that I didn’t feel around writing poetry, weirdly,” she says. “Also I had my first son quite young – I was only 22 – and poetry was quicker.”What made you want to be a writer?Reading. I was a very isolated, introverted kid, and I loved books. I started off with Hans Christian Andersen, the Grimm Brothers, Black Beauty….How did you come to write this book?I started to write As You Were around the end of 2014, it took four years and it was a hard write. But I had this voice of the narrator, Sinead, and I just kept knocking.What do you think about the world of books and publishing in 2020?People are reading books again – we worried it was all screens, but people have gone back to books.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I teach boys at a Catholic secondary school, and creative writing at the university in Galway, and I have two sons. So I am busy! I plonked my desk in the big open-plan kitchen in our bungalow and I just put headphones on and do the work. It’s the house I grew up in, so it’s got a very weird energy. When my parents were selling I said I’d buy it I like being rooted.What books have inspired you?Edna O’Brien. Maeve Binchy. The poetry we did in school was extremely important: I found my teens quite hard, and I remember reading Patrick Kavanagh’s Inniskeen Road which is about isolation – and I discovered: “Oh, this isn’t a unique feeling, you can get through this.”What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m reading a very strange book that came out in the 90s called I Could Read the Sky by Timothy O’Grady. It’s the tightest prose.What is the best debut novel you’ve read?Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett. It’s stunning. She’s also my friend! But we write completely differently: I think I give her a headache when I talk about all of my characters.Are you working on your second book?I’m interested in the workings of institutions and power in everyday life. My next one is going to be set in a rightwing Catholic school.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Pay it forward if you get a break – don’t be an ass, be nice.Beth Morrey, 42, grew up in Derbyshire before studying English at Cambridge, and left university with ambitions to become a comedy writer. A career in factual television beckoned instead and she eventually joined the production company RDF Television, rising to become creative director, responsible for shows including The Secret Life of Four-Year-Olds and 100-Year-Old Drivers. It was while on maternity leave that she decided to embrace her long-held ambition to write a novel and the result, Saving Missy, became the subject of a 10-publisher auction and has since sold in 16 overseas territories. It’s a book about community, loneliness and unexpected friendships, continuing the trend for “up lit”.What made you want to be a writer?I wanted to see my name on the spine of a book in a bookshop. I’ve always written since I was about five, when I wrote a story about Icarus. I wrote in television but I wanted to be a writer of books.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?I wanted to write a book about hope that would make people cry in a happy way.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?It’s very strict. I go for a run and then I write from 10am-2pm in a cafe that I love. I like background noise and chatter because I find I can tune in and out of it. And then I come home, have lunch and edit until about 5pm, when I go and pick up my kids.What books have inspired you to be a writer?About a Boy by Nick Hornby was a huge influence on me. I really like that sparse, puritan prose where it seems straightforward but it’s not. And Sue Townsend – I grew up with the Adrian Mole books, adored them, read them over and over again.What are the best and worst things about being a writer?The best thing is when stuff comes out of your head that surprises you: that’s wonderful. The worst thing is the scrutiny. I know that not everyone is going to like my book and I’ve just got to take it on the chin.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Lots of people say: “I’ve got a book in me.” But they never actually get around to it. It’s hard to get to the end of a book, to write those 90,000 words. And so I’d say, if you write to that extent then you are a writer, and what happens after that is just luck. HBDouglas Stuart was brought up on a housing estate in 1980s Glasgow. His alcoholic mother died when he was 16 he never met his father. He studied textiles in Galashiels and then the Royal College of Art. For the past 20 years, he has lived and worked as a fashion designer in New York, first for Calvin Klein, then Ralph Lauren, then as head of design for Gap. Most recently, he designed for Jack Spade. Shuggie Bain tells the story of awkward, lonely Hugh “Shuggie” Bain and his ambitious, charismatic mother, Agnes, as they try to protect each other – and themselves – amid the brutal destitution of Thatcher’s Britain.What made you want to be a writer?I always wanted to be a writer. Fashion has provided me with a wonderful life, but I’ve been writing now for 12 years in private, in secret, for myself. I didn’t write this book with any notion of it being published, of it even being read by someone else. What I decided when I turned 40 a few years ago was that it was time to take a sabbatical. I had dreams that were going unanswered and those were dreams of writing. So I took time out to write and showed Shuggie to a friend in publishing and the response has just been phenomenal.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?It’s a love story about two souls trapped in a hyper-masculine world who are struggling to get by, to survive, to love each other.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I need complete silence, which is very hard to achieve in New York as there’s construction going on around me all the time. The most important thing that I own is a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and every morning, at about seven, they go on and I immerse myself in my work. I’m an early-morning writer. Because New York is such a cramped real estate market I have to wait for my husband to stop banging coffee mugs and the dishwasher and leave for work. I get up before he gets up in the morning, then I take a couple of hours off to hang out with him, then when he goes off to work I get straight back to it.Best debut you have read?Morvern Callar by Alan Warner. Here was a book where I saw people like myself reflected and I could really empathise with Morvern’s desire to escape from the world she was in. It knocked me sideways.What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m currently reading And the Land Lay Still by James Robertson. It’s a book that’s been out for 10 years or so. I’m also rereading Young Adam by Alexander Trocchi and then also The Trick Is to Keep Breathing by Janice Galloway. A book I’ve just finished and loved is Lowborn by Kerry Hudson. It’s a wonderful book, such quiet grace.Best and worst things about being a writer?The worst thing is the loneliness, especially coming from an industry which is all about dynamic team-building, and I sometimes find myself feeling isolated, but the best thing is the focus that loneliness brings. So for both sides of the question the answer is loneliness.What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Don’t fear if you don’t come from a certain background. Find what it is only you can offer the world and put that on the page.Interview by Alex PrestonTwenty-seven-year-old Jessica Moor lives in Berlin but was born in south-east London and her debut novel, Keeper, started life while she was doing an MA in creative writing at Manchester University, where she was mentored by Jeanette Winterson. A literary thriller, Keeper is a compelling, tense and pacy read, with a central character who works in a women’s refuge. Moor herself worked for a domestic violence charity for a while after finishing her BA. “It was a bit of a ‘road not taken’,” she says. “I was thinking about training to be a psychotherapist and I needed a day job that would lead to a relevant field. But I was also drawn to it because I’m very much a feminist, although, looking back, I feel like my feminism was quite underdeveloped at that point.” The role developed her thinking. “It made me feel that everything is connected, and that there is a dismissal of women and the control of women’s bodies that underpins everything… there’s an ideology behind it and the logical conclusion of that ideology is violence against women.” Your book describes controlling, coercive behaviour. Is this something you have experienced?I’ve certainly felt it in the world around me in my past relationships, and in my friends’ relationships and this was one of the things I understood better after working for the domestic violence organisation – there’s a continuum of behaviour. It starts with texting, you know, saying: “Where are you? Who are you with? What are you wearing?” Which I and lots of my friends have experienced. It’s not healthy, but it is common. And that is on a spectrum of behaviour. It’s entitlement, and it’s the failure to treat women as fully autonomous beings.What’s the best debut you have read?Anne Michaels’s Fugitive Pieces was a debut novel, wasn’t it? I think it is a masterpiece.What books are currently on your bedside table?I’m reading Samantha Power’s The Education of an Idealist at the moment, which I’m massively enjoying. I relate to her a lot, her slightly morbid fascination with the world’s suffering and a sort of rampant catastrophising.What is your second book about?It’s historical and, again, my way in is through a violence-against-women lens. My ambition is to be a sort of feminist hermit crab and to go into different genres and unpick them and see what’s there that may have been suppressed. Interview by Ursula KennyAuthor of What’s Left of Me Is Yours (Orion, 21 April)Stephanie Scott was born and raised in Singapore. She came to the UK to study English at university, where she specialised in Renaissance literature. Just as she was starting her PhD at Cambridge, she decided that she couldn’t face the idea of “being locked in a garret,” and took a job on the hedge fund desk at Lehman Brothers. Working late nights on deals, she’d dream of becoming a novelist and scan the websites of creative writing courses. She finally took the plunge, applying to study at the Faber Academy and on Oxford University’s creative writing master’s programme. “I was accepted on both and so I decided to do both, to really pursue writing seriously.” Scott’s debut, What’s Left of Me Is Yours, delves into the murky world of Japanese marriage-wreckers to tell a strange and tragic love story.How did you come to write this book?I read an article by Richard Lloyd Parry of the Financial Times about a real-life crime. In that case a marriage break-up agent had strangled his lover when she discovered his true profession and threatened to leave him. The agent was arrested at the scene and confessed to police, but as he was speaking to the police he said: “I loved her, I love her still.” And it’s the humanity of that original story that drew me to it.I was newly married at the time and was thinking a lot about love and enduring relationships. I kept wondering about that idea: can you love someone and kill them? Because love ideally requires selflessness, but then I thought perhaps there are as many different types of love as there are people.Where do you write and what is your work schedule?I need to be at my desk in my study. I need to know what I’m writing about. A lot of the novel was drafted by just writing what I wanted without planning out where it was going but, having said that, the novel is so research-based that I had to have the grounding in place before I could begin it.Have you been mentored or particularly encouraged by anyone? If so by whom and how?I was taught on the Faber novel course by Louise Doughty and Louise has been hugely supportive of this novel from beginning to end. By the time it comes out it will have been 10 years in the making. She has been an extraordinary mentor. She was instrumental in my finally deciding to leave finance and focus on the book, which was a crazy thing to do at the time.Best debut you have read?My Sister the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite. I absolutely adored it.What single piece of advice would you offer aspiring writers?Persevere and believe in yourself and your project. APAt just 27, Naoise (pronounced “Neesha”) Dolan is remarkably self-assured and laid-back about the prospect of becoming a published novelist. “It seems like a nice job to have,” she says breezily. Born in Dublin, she studied English at Trinity College but had never seen writing as anything more than “a hobby I enjoyed, like playing the piano and drawing”, until she took a creative writing course in her final year. “That was a game-changer. I came out of it pretty much saying, ‘I want to write a book’,” she says.A year teaching English in Hong Kong provided the setting and subject matter for Exciting Times, the story of a love triangle that also explores class, colonialism, language and more, while also being frank about female sexuality. Dolan’s friend Sally Rooney (a couple of years ahead at Trinity), published the first chapter in her literary journal, Stinging Fly, and a seven-way publishers’ scrum ensued. Is she, as the industry buzz suggests, the next Rooney? We’ll see when her novel hits bookshops in April.If you had to sell the book in a sentence, what would you say?I think I’d say it’s about love, money and the intimate lives of three young cynics living in Hong Kong – and I would do my best to keep a straight face.Is there anything you need to work?I’m completely dependent on coffee but that’s not writing-specific: I’d be a shell of a human being without it.What books have inspired you to be a writer?I always loved the Victorians. They were pretty much a special interest since my early teens, which is why I did a master’s in Victorian literature at Oxford after I’d been to Hong Kong. I think of all of them, Dickens has inspired me the most because he has got what very few people have, which is the ability to construct this compelling story but also to write absolutely wonderfully at a line-by-line level. On any page of Dickens you’ve got a really unusual cluster of words or something really funny or true, but you really want to find out what happens next as well.What are the best and worst things about being a writer?Best is having a book always humming in your mind. It’s really nice, even when something miserable happens in your day, to be able to think, maybe I can work that into the story. It helps you make sense of everything else in your life. Worst is people expecting you to be precious about your book and treat it like your baby, because I am not sentimental like that at all. For my mother, for instance, the idea of me being edited was this offensive thing, while I’m like: “Yeah, let’s get the scalpel out, let’s fix it.”What single piece of advice would you offer to aspiring writers?Ignore the whole social performance of being a literary person. That thing of feeling you have to go to book launches or that all your friends have to be writers. That stuff is irrelevant to writing a book and it can take up a lot of your time and money if you let it. It’s not what makes you a writer. Interview by Lisa O’KellyLouise Hare, 39, works in the travel industry and did a part-time MA in creative writing at Birkbeck, London University. Her debut novel grew out of a short story written in her first semester. Set in postwar south London, it tells the story of Lawrie – a young Jamaican musician recently arrived on the Empire Windrush – and Evie, the mixed-race girl girl next door with whom he falls in love. Hare herself is mixed race – “half Nigerian, half British” – and grew up in Warrington in Cheshire where she lived with her adoptive (white) parents and brother before moving to London 13 or so years ago. Hare’s timely story (written before the Windrush scandal was revealed) foregrounds the racism and bigotry the Windrush arrivals encountered. The idea to write about that era took root after a visit Hare made to a deep level shelter below Clapham Common which was used, for a while, to house passengers from the Windrush. “Can you imagine?” she asks. “Being on that boat for ages, getting off and they put you down there.”What made you want to be a writer?About five years ago, I realised that although I don’t hate my job, the thought of doing it for another 30 to 40 years filled me with dread. I thought, if I could find something I really loved what would that be?How much had you written before?There wasn’t that much creative writing at school, so it has always been in my own time. In my 20s, a couple of times I sat down to write and just found that I didn’t really have anything to say. It wasn’t until I got to about 35 that I thought, I want to read a different kind of book. I was in a book club at the time with a couple of people who were mixed-race and we were always talking about how the books we wanted to read just didn’t exist. And I thought, well, wouldn’t it be great if I could write something that I want to read? So I spent two years writing a book that’s now in a drawer somewhere. I sent it out to loads of agents and got some nice feedback including from my now agent, but nobody was interested enough to publish it. That was when I signed up to the MA, to have something to feel positive about and to see if I was actually any good.Which writers inspired you? I love Sarah Waters’s books. I like what she does, putting LGBT characters into historical novels. I like Andrea Levy as well. I’ll also say James Baldwin: I read Another Country a couple of times during the writing of this book because it’s got a lot of jazz in so I wanted to see how he had sort of infused his writing with the music. And I’d also say Marlon James, in terms of current writers. I love what he’s doing.What books are on your bedside table?I’ve just finished Nora Ephron’s Heartburn which is very funny. I’ve also got an advance copy of a short story collection by Zora Neale Hurston which is a reissue as well. I’m doing a bit of research for a potential book that I don’t have a story for yet so I’ve got a book called War to Windrush by Stephen Bourne which is about black women in Britain during the second world war.What’s the best debut you have read?Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi.

I no longer attend the Davos World Economic Forum but last weekend marked the 25th annual seminar for British and Italian journalists hosted by the Italian government in – well, Venice.Before I left, several people asked why I was going, because pictures of Venice under water had been flashed around the world. “Climate change, global warming” seemed to be the general verdict.However, the climate crisis should not be confused with the tidal pattern that Venice has experienced for centuries – duckboards make a regular appearance when the high tide comes in.Venice, like so many places, is unquestionably vulnerable to the climate crisis, but I can report that the streets were clear of water and duckboards last weekend. Instead of worrying, as they usually do, that there were too many tourists, the city authorities were actually expressing concern that the bad publicity had damaged the tourist industry.The Venice seminar embraces many political, diplomatic and economic issues, but regular readers will not be surprised that, for me, one of the most interesting aspects was the sadness the Italians present expressed about the UK’s departure from the European Union.Last year, the hope was that this country would have second thoughts and recognise how much it stood to lose by honouring a referendum result that principally reflected dissatisfaction with many things other than the EU. This year, the mood was that we all had to make the best of it, given the long history of close ties between the UK and Italy over centuries.Italy, of course, was a founder member of what was then the European Economic Community. It was not for nothing that the 1957 treaty was signed in Rome. Italy joined the European exchange rate mechanism in 1979 when the UK declined. It also joined the eurozone – the single currency – in 1999.Both decisions were, to my mind, justified more by political than economic considerations. Because the country had a chronically higher inflation rate than Germany’s, it used to benefit from the freedom to devalue the lira from time to time, in order to maintain its price competitiveness against the Deutschmark in export markets.It is a not-very-well-kept secret that, quite apart from any other problems, the growth rate of the Italian economy suffered for a long time from this loss of exchange rate flexibility vis-a-vis other EU countries. There is little doubt that this was one of the factors behind the rise in Italian populism and the desire of populist parties to leave the eurozone. But I get the impression that the powers that be think – or at least want to believe – that the economy has to some extent adapted to the rigours of the eurozone and been showing some resilience.Which brings me back to this benighted land that has been captured by the Brexiters. Is this economy going to show some resilience in the face of what, frankly, I still regard as a potential economic catastrophe? In my last column I expressed the hope that Boris Johnson would see sense, ensure that this would be “Brexit in name only” and that we should, in our own interest, keep close to the customs union and the single market after this year’s transition period.But the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, has abandoned the sensible close alignment policy of his predecessor, Philip Hammond – that seems such along time ago! – and has proclaimed: “There will not be alignment, we will not be a rule taker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union.”The government’s own internal studies and analysis point to a severe threat from abandoning the single market, which was one of the key attractions for foreign companies, not least the Japanese, to invest in those parts of the Midlands and northern England where “getting Brexit done” has proved such a compelling slogan. (By the way, there is nothing new about working-class people voting Conservative!)On the face of it, the JohnsonCummings government wants to address those discontents which, ironically, brought it to power via Brexit. Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, wants to end austerity, improve the NHS and satisfy the so-called left behind.Let us hope they can do this. But it is a mammoth task when they are simultaneously making the country poorer. Already a study by Bloomberg finds that the cost to the economy of the very approach to Brexit taken over the past three years has equalled the entire accumulated cost of our contributions to the Brussels budget – contributions that often flowed back to us via funds from the European Investment Bank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce07a2fe738399bc6e256c1f6a63ca398a10a74/73_41_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=334ed5379384449da6c70126dd5cb0a2","title":"no history no languages the end of humanities only deepens divides","story":"Sunderland University is offering only career-focused courses to its next student cohortSunderland University wants to become more “career-focused”. So it is to shut down all its language, politics and history courses and promote instead degrees that “align with particular employment sectors”. It’s an illustration of what happens when universities turn into businesses, and their ethos is defined by the market. It’s also symbolic of the isions that now rend Britain’s social fabric.Just as Sunderland was announcing its makeover, the Sutton Trust was publishing a report on the geography of social mobility. The report, Elites in the UK: Pulling Away?, confirmed that social mobility has declined in recent decades. It showed that the majority of the socially mobile have built their careers close to home while the majority of those who come from privileged backgrounds tend to move greater distances in search of upward mobility. London is barely open to people from working-class backgrounds – three-quarters of those who move to London to access good jobs are already part of the elite.None of this should come as a surprise. The distinctive character of London has long been known. There has been growing recognition, too, that the issue is not simply one of London versus the rest of the country, but also a broader ide between big cities and smaller towns.From education to health, from transport to culture, the thinktank Centre for Towns argues, those living in cities have advantages and opportunities often denied to those in towns. If you live in a small town, you’re likely to have to travel almost three times as far to reach a hospital, and almost twice as far to see a GP or dentist as someone in a large city. There will probably be fewer pubs, a more rundown high street and less accessible public transport. Of course, the experience of living in a small town is different in affluent areas of Oxfordshire or Surrey than in Wales or the north-east. And those without money or jobs are far less able to take advantage of the opportunities of a city than those with affluence.All this explains why Sunderland University’s decision is so depressing. It’s a university that, like many in the north-east, caters to students from the local area. Its repurposing seems to suggest that the study of the humanities should be reserved for the children of the rich, who can afford to move, while local working-class students should be confined to “vocational” subjects. Existing isions will only deepen.The current debate over white privilege is equally depressing, polarised as it is between those who insist that racism is no longer an issue in Britain and those who imagine that all white people, whether shelf-stackers or company bosses, possess “privilege”.It would seem that it’s not just potential students in Sunderland who are being deprived of deeper thinking into sociology, history and politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bed28b5978dfb615a3e9cb0fa9b9d2658c00de/1648_7_765_459/master/765.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0d7d65ce332405875913c36722fc07dc","title":"humpback whales bunny chow and golden beaches why you should visit durban","story":"Desperate for a dose of winter sun? South Africa’s Durban delivers 320 days of sunshine every year, as well as surfing, foodie adventures and sensational land and sea safariOnce seen as the quiet cousin of cosmopolitan Cape Town and fast-paced Johannesburg, the natural wonders and cultural charms of Durban and its surrounds put it firmly on South Africa’s must-see map. Fly direct from London Heathrow to Durban with British Airways, then get exploring.The best place for a first-look at “Durbs” – as the locals call it – is down on the Golden Mile, an iconic stretch (nearly three-miles long, not one, as its name would have you believe) of powdery beaches backed by a colourful pedestrian promenade, all of it smartened up for the 2010 World Cup.Shimmering off to the north is another legacy project of the tournament, the Moses Mabhida Stadium. An 80-metre freefall and 220-metre arc makes the Big Rush Big Swing from the stadium arch the world’s tallest swing, while the more sedate SkyCar delivers superb views of the city and its beaches.With miles of golden sand, and water that rarely dips below 20C, Durban richly deserves its reputation as South Africa’s surfing capital. Surf schools on the promenade – try Xpression or Learn 2 Surf – will have you up and riding in no time. The smaller waves of South Beach are best for beginners, while expert surfers will delight in the long tubes of New Pier.From May to November, these seas are also home to humpback and southern right whales, while Bryde’s, sperm and minke whales inhabit the oceans all year round. Look out for lobtailing, when a whale slaps its tail on the water to create waves, and breaching, when a whale launches out of the water as if ready to backflip. And that wasn’t enough, you can often spot dolphins ing in the crests of the waves. Whale and Dolphin Tours offer daily aquatic safari cruises from Durban marina the company is committed to training tour guides from disadvantaged communities and supporting Whale Time’s environmental research.Oceans aside, Durban is giving Cape Town a run for its money when it comes to culinary adventures. On tree-lined Florida Road you’ll find a neat cross section of the city’s resurgent kitchen creativity, from pan-African flavours at Dukkah to the ice-cream-filled macaroons of chef Zakeeya Mitha’s Sugarlicious. The falooda-inspired Bombay crush ice-cream is the go-to here.But when it comes to dining, Durban is all about curry. Don’t leave without braving the famous “bunny chow”: a quarter-loaf of white bread, hollowed out and filled with bean or mutton curry. You’ll find bunny chow across the city, but in Durban central the Oriental restaurant is an institution. A mutton bunny will set you back just R79.95 (£4.19).It’s also just a short walk from the colourful Victoria Street Market, where spice shops are piled high with fiery bespoke blends. Around the corner, the Juma Masjid is worth a look. It’s one of the largest mosques in the southern hemisphere, the domed facade completed in 1943.There’s certainly plenty to keep you busy in the city, but as the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province Durban is also the perfect starting point for adventures farther afield. With public transport thin on the ground, an Avis rental car is your best bet.A 20-minute drive north of the city brings you to the seaside suburb of Umhlanga, long favoured by South African holidaymakers. You’ll want to spend time exploring the walking trails of the Umhlanga Lagoon Nature Reserve, or browsing the weekly Wednesday morning farmers’ market, but first drop your bags at the Oyster Box hotel, an elegant grande dame of South Africa’s seaside hotels. The pool terrace delivers impressive views – of breaching whales and the ocean – but the attentive staff will also happily set up deckchairs and umbrellas on the beach for you. And there’s no need to venture out in search of dinner: the generous curry buffet here is legendary. Beware the fiery beef vindaloo.Another 30 minutes’ drive along the Dolphin Coast brings you to Zimbali Coastal Resort, where the Fairmont Zimbali Resort offers 154 luxury rooms, secluded beaches and easy access to the resort’s excellent 18-hole golf course, which plays through lush coastal forest. Bring plenty of spare balls.South Africa is synonymous with safari, and Phinda Private Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park are just two hours’ drive farther north, with a clutch of upscale safari lodges dishing up five-star luxury and Big Five sightings. As well as lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo, you may even catch a glimpse of the elusive cheetah.Or head west from Durban, towards the rugged peaks of the Drakensberg mountains. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg park was declared a world heritage site in 2000, noted for its ancient San rock art and rugged scenery. The historic battlefields of central KwaZulu-Natal are also within easy reach for travellers with a car, with talented guides bringing the drama and tragedy of the protracted Anglo-Zulu wars of the late-1800s to life.So now, the choice is yours. Battles? The Big Five? Beaches? Bunny chow? One thing’s for certain, Durban is no longer second fiddle when it comes to cosmopolitan coastal escapes in South Africa.How to bookWith direct flights from London Heathrow to Durban, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

The Office for Students in England recently set ambitious targets for wider access. But a team at the UCL Institute of Education say their research, published by the Centre for Economic Performance, throws into question whether simply getting poor students into university is enough.They examined the “quality match” between students and the courses they attend, using data on a cohort who enrolled in university in 2008. A student was considered well-matched if they had similar A-level scores to others on their course.They were deemed under-matched if they attended a course where fellow students had lower grades – suggesting they could have attended a more academically prestigious course and over-matched if other students on the course had gained higher grades than they had.“It could well be that students from disadvantaged backgrounds might not feel that they fit in at more prestigious places,” said Gill Wyness, professor of economics, who led the research.She added that multiple factors could be at work. There has been speculation that poorer students might tend to pick the closest university to home to save money. But Wyness said the research suggested the picture was more complicated than that.“You’re much more likely to go to your local university if you are from a poorer background. But if you look at all the students who go to a university that is near them, the disadvantaged kids will still go to a lower-quality university than the advantaged kids. Take London, for example, the rich kids will go to the Russell Group, they’ll go to UCL, and the poorer kids will go to South Bank. Geography doesn’t seem to be the driver of mismatch – the poorer students are still going to lower-quality universities.”Wyness said this suggested poorer students would benefit from more outreach work from high-ranking universities.She cited the example of No 10’s behavioural insights team, also known as nudge unit, which conducted an experiment The team also found female students attended courses with lower future average earnings than men, something the researchers said had implications for closing the gender pay gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cdd9be9c9d0478bd0914513184c4e6edcef8dab/0_239_3271_1962/master/3271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4c1e76c57b61d89f74d11809f7e57b0","title":"cacao not gold chocolate trees offer future to amazon tribes aoe","story":"In Brazil’s largest indigenous reserve thousands of saplings have been planted as an alternative to profits from illegal gold miningThe villagers walk down the grassy landing strip, past the wooden hut housing the health post and into the thick forest, pointing out the seedlings they planted along the way. For these Ye’kwana indigenous men, the skinny saplings, less than a metre high, aren’t just baby cacao trees but green shoots of hope in a land scarred by the violence, pollution and destruction wrought by illegal gold prospecting. That hope is chocolate.“We want to plant and develop income for the community,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, president of the Ye’kwana people’s Wanasseduume association, which came up with the idea. “And it is not destructive for the forest.”In the last two years, thousands of Theobroma cacao trees have been planted near Waikás and other villages in the remote Yanomami indigenous reserve. The saplings were planted within the forest because cacao likes shade, an idea borrowed from agroforestry techniques successfully used for cacao elsewhere in the Amazon.Villagers hope that within a few years rich, organic chocolate will be produced from the golden cacao fruit these trees bear. The project – run by the reserve’s indigenous associations Wanasseduume and Hutukara with Brazilian non-profit group Instituto Socioambiental (ISA) – is ambitious, but experts say it is based on a potential commercial reality.Located in the far north of the Brazilian Amazon, Yanomami is Brazil’s biggest indigenous reserve, spread over 9.6 million hectares (23.7m acres). But its wild, mountainous forests are overrun by an estimated 20,000 wildcat goldminers, called garimpeiros.Ye’kwana and Yanomami indigenous leaders called for the garimpeiros to be expelled with a letter and group photo later shared by actor Leonardo DiCaprio.But the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed that indigenous people really yearn for white society’s consumer lifestyles, said the Yanomami reserve is too big for its population and may be sued for racism by the Brazilian Indigenous People’s Association after comments during a Facebook Live broadcast this week. “The indigenous changed, they are evolving,” he said. “More and more the indigenous are human beings equal to us.”“The president says indigenous people are poor. We are not poor. Nobody goes hungry here,” says Júlio Ye’kwana. “We eat for free.” was invited to visit by the Hutukara Yanomami Association, founded by Davi Kopenawa, a leader and shaman who fought to create the reserve with photographer Claudia Andujar and non-profit group Survival International.Five villages from both tribes are participating in the cacao project. Cacao trees are native in this area, but around 3,000 new seedlings have been planted to boost production, with 7,000 expected by the end of 2021.Edmilson Estevão shins up a mature cacao tree to bring down some of the heavy yellow fruit. Inside each thick shell is a sticky cluster of seeds, packed in a sweet, delicious, pale paste. These are dried and roasted to make chocolate.“One tree like this can bear up to 20 fruit,” says Estevão, 33, who was raised in Waikás and works for Wanasseduume.These mature trees were planted more than a decade ago by Luiz Ye’kwana. He was murdered by garimpeiros after refusing to transport them upriver, villagers say.Violence is a recurrent problem around garimpeiros, as becomes graphically evident the next day. Outside the health post, two garimpeiros are wrapping a dead body in a tarpaulin. The dead man was known as Eduardo at Tatuzão, the illegal gold mining camp two hours’ boat ride upstream. But everybody uses an alias there. The nurse who fought to save his life discovered that his real name was Ralf Cabral and he was 21. The garimpeiros say he shot himself.His eyes are wide open, he is dressed in black football shorts, and there is a bandage over the bullet hole in his chest. “He’s been here for five months, and now he’s done this,” says Manoel dos Santos, 49, wrapping Cabral’s body. “I have no idea why.”The health post was built by the Brazilian government to serve the village’s 150 Ye’kwana people, but also handles hundreds of garimpeiro cases each year, including miscarriages, malaria, snake bites, broken limbs, knife and gunshot wounds. “It’s a war here,” says Giselle Dornellas, 33, the nurse who kept Cabral alive for 12 hours.Garimpo gold is seductive and buys televisions and phones. Four villagers work as boat pilots, others deliver food, and even the village community centre was built with garimpo money.But the cacao project will offer an alternative, says its coordinator, ISA anthropologist Moreno Saraiva. “We’re trying to build another possible future,” he says. “It will take five years, but if we don’t do this now there will never be another alternative.”The project was inspired by another ISA project that since 2016 has produced edible mushrooms in other Yanomami villages. On paper the cacao project makes sense. Most of the world’s cacao production is in Africa, but the plant is native to the Amazon and was domesticated in South America 4,000 years ago. The Aztecs used the beans as money. And a Spanish map from 1775 called the Yanomami area the “Pais de los cacaguales” – or “Cacao Land”.“You have a traditional and well-spread presence of native cocoa trees,” says food researcher Roberto Smeraldi, vice-president of the Atá Institute founded by Alex Atala – the Michelin starred Brazilian chef renowned for using ingredients from the Amazon.Smeraldi recruited César de Mendes, a chocolate specialist based near the Amazon city of Belém for the cacao project. ISA and the indigenous associations organised well-attended workshops with de Mendes in Waikás in 2018 and 2019 to show villagers how cacao seeds are processed to make chocolate.Fruit from mature Yanomami cacao trees was used to produce a trial run. A thousand 50g bars of the bitter, delicious Yanomami chocolate quickly sold out at an event in São Paulo last December, despite a £9.20 price tag. Customers were happy to pay to compensate for the destruction caused by garimpo, de Mendes says. Profits went to both indigenous associations.“I am not being much of a businessman, I am being more an activist,” de Mendes says. “We are selling to an aware public.”He learned his trade from his grandmother, who made her own chocolate in an Amazon riverside community, and singles out the Yanomami chocolate’s notes of almond oil and flowers, light acidity and sweetness. “These give this cacao its own personality,” he says.Smeraldi argues that the Yanomami cacao’s origins in this isolated jungle could make its genetic properties attractive to the world cacao industry, which is vulnerable to climate change and blights such as the witches’ broom fungus which ravaged cacao plantations in the state of Bahia three decades ago.And the chocolate’s strong, persistent taste could find its niche in the booming, specialist chocolate market, he says. Distinct fruits and flavours are increasingly sought out, as happened with wine when customers graduated from ordering “red” or “white” to specific grapes and countries. “It is a product of high complexity,” Smeraldi says.But Bolsonaro’s government is heading in the opposite direction. It is sending a bill to Congress to legalise garimpo, which the energy minister, Admiral Bento Albuquerque, recently presented to European diplomats.The news chills villagers in Waikás. “If Bolsonaro succeeds, it’s the end for our people,” says Eduardo da Silva, 65. But it has also bolstered support for the cacao project.“We have to do it for our children, not for us,” says Felipe Gimenes, 45, the village schoolteacher and former chief who planted an extra 200 cacao seedlings on his own plot. “This is our opportunity.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3dc95181d849e44a30f9f2fd810ce45dcbdbb18/612_502_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da03d54dcabd2aad45fd505273f2855","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including white-tailed eagles and a detained lion cub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49649da939d75cc4072176f8ffebe02771b5341/172_30_8403_5042/master/8403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95735767fdd920ad335fd42e9d4688e6","title":"scott parker fulham old school values social media fa cup","story":"Fulham’s manager has old-school values but understands the effects toxic social media can have on his players“I used a psychologist when I was playing,” Scott Parker says. “It’s one of the most powerful things: how you can have a concrete head and not let things in. Of course there’s a technical element but nine times out of 10 when you’re having a bad day it will mainly be mental: the mistake you’ve made, the comment you’ve heard, the crowd’s reaction to a shot over the bar – after that the fear’s coming in.”The mind fascinates Parker. Fulham’s manager wants to understand the human psyche. He aims to give his players resilience and the tools to think clearly under pressure. “You have your first 10 touches and kick it into the stand, there’s a technical element,” he says. “But what makes the 11th touch go in the stand again? It’s probably because the crowd are on me. You need to think: ‘Let me go back to basics and build.’ It starts in your head and taking a deep breath.”Less than a year into his first management job Parker understands how fear takes hold. As a youngster at Charlton he was carefree. That changed when he moved to Chelsea in 2004. The pressure was hard and it did not become any easier when he joined Newcastle in 2006.“I started to struggle,” he says. “I’d go out every day on the grass and train my left foot. I’d try and get as fit as I could. But there are certain elements in games where it’s nothing to do with technique. It’s more: ‘I was training today and was really sloppy in the way I was.’ I took it into coaching.“These boys are only human and at times there are 30,000 screaming at you. Now they’ve got the added pressure of going into the changing room and the first thing you see them do is click on their phone and Twitter comes up. You don’t know the effect it’s having on players but it’s at the forefront of my mind. When I was playing it was a newspaper report. Now it’s a whole new dynamic. You type your name in and nine times out of 10 it’s negative.“We do live in a world where with the click of a button you’ve got something on your doorstep. I talk a lot about earning the right to take a picture of yourself. Earn the right to be a top player, earn the right to win a trophy. There’s so much money in what we’re doing and added to that is a social media platform where with one picture you can pretend to be whoever you want to be. In reality is it really like that?”At 39 years old and the father of four boys, Parker is an interesting mix. He has old-school values and hates the falseness and toxicity of social media. At the same time, however, he is empathetic, inquisitive and flexible enough to build connections with his players.The former England midfielder – he won 18 caps from 2003-13 – was thrown in at the deep end, appointed on a caretaker basis when Fulham sacked Claudio Ranieri last March. Relegation from the Premier League was a certainty but the club saw enough to give Parker the job permanently.The early signs are promising for Fulham, who visit Manchester City in the FA Cup on Sunday. They are third in the Championship, three points behind second-placed Leeds, and Parker speaks enthusiastically about building for the long term. As a player he was everywhere. As a manager he wants standards to be high across the board.At the start of pre-season Parker commissioned an external company to assess his squad’s personality. “We profiled every player on how they want to be addressed, where they sit, certain spectrums of their personality in that sense,” he says. “We did that so as a manager I have a rough idea of: ‘This is what he’s like, he doesn’t like a brutal honest conversation, he doesn’t want to be exposed in front of his peers.’“Those little snippets give me a lot of info because now, if I’m dealing with a player I need to sanction, I have a rough idea of where I need to get. The players understood we’re all different. What Joe Bryan accepts and what Kevin McDonald or Harry Arter accept is very different and we need to understand we can’t all be like this.”Parker has reintegrated Aboubakar Kamara, who was arrested at Fulham’s training ground last January. The striker signed a new contract last month. “At times you have to manage him very differently from some of the others,” Parker says. “But I’ve not had a problem. I wouldn’t accept having a big problem with him either.”Accepting that footballers have changed is part of the challenge. “I don’t see as much of a resilience any more,” Parker says. “I look at my kids sometimes and it’s so easy to jump from one ship to the next. It’s easy to say: ‘If that’s not working, let’s get on to something else.’ There’s going to be some bumps along the way but you’ve got to keep going for it again.“There are core values about how you conduct yourself, your work ethic and having a real passion about what you do. They’re core values that will always stick with me and I’ll always use in the modern day.“They’re the traits I need to instil in my players even more because I realise they’re probably deficient in them because they’ve not been around them as much as I have. Can I give them something which I know will make them better? And vice versa. I’m not on social media. At times I don’t know how quickly the world’s moving and I’m constantly having to check. I suppose I’m trying to learn some bits from this new generation.”“Every day can you drive yourself to improve? Every day can you drive others? In the good teams and the best players I played with that’s what they had: self-drive. You don’t expect to play. There’s a fear about being dropped. A fear of not performing. Fear drives them on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e79c588fd59b4a85810fbcbc16bce8d2141c97/83_78_2717_1630/master/2717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65a1a82517c903c676534f6a33b7bf1d","title":"west ham david moyes fa cup west brom","story":"• The Premier League club lost at home to West Brom • Moyes desperate to make signings this weekDavid Moyes said he wanted to make more than three substitutions at half-time after West Ham were knocked out of the FA Cup by 10-man West Bromwich Albion, who reached the fifth round despite Slaven Bilic making eight changes against his old club.Conor Townsend’s early goal sent the Championship’s pacesetters into the fifth round and ensured that Bilic enjoyed a triumphant return to the London Stadium. West Ham, who are battling relegation from the Premier League, were abject during the first half and Moyes reacted by using up all his substitutions during the interval.“I think I could have probably made a couple more if I was allowed,” West Ham’s manager said. “I just thought we passed the ball away. I wanted to see if I could do something that would make a difference. I think it got better. The second half got much better but we didn’t manufacture anything that was clear cut.”Moyes, who returned to West Ham after Manuel Pellegrini was sacked last month, said that nothing has changed at the east London club since his first spell. “I came with the same problem last time,” he said. “What I need to do is find something which can give us inspiration. The last time Marko Arnautovic gave us inspiration.”West Ham have league games against Liverpool on Wednesday and Brighton next Saturday and Moyes accepted that losing to a heavily rotated Championship team was a concern. “I totally accept it and it was pretty much a West Ham first team today,” he said.West Ham hope to strengthen their midfield by signing Slavia Prague’s Tomas Soucek. They have made a €15m bid for the Czech Republic midfielder but his club are holding out for €20m and the Hammers need signings before the transfer window shuts on Friday. “I’m desperately trying to get people in who we think can do something for the team and that’s not easy,” Moyes said.Bilic, who saw Semi Ajayi sent off near the end, backed Moyes to keep West Ham up. “David can do that,” West Brom’s manager said. “The players have to do it. They have done it before and they have to do it now. Now what is very important is the crowd recognise the situation, be behind the team and be behind the club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba33d0d83eb45156cc1d0d419182baa644ffa0e8/80_5_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8729bf6638c3c31e0b76a7bc0d64d684","title":"fifa football global elite more money club world cup","story":"The tournament will begin in its new expanded format in summer 2021 and already it has forced the Africa Cup of Nations to be re-rescheduledTippi Hedren sits on a bench outside the school. Behind her, crows gradually settle on a climbing frame. She smokes, distracted. By the time she finally notices a crow pass above her, it is too late. The frame, the roofs behind, the telegraph pole, the fence are laden with crows and the attack on the children cannot be averted. This is the greatest scene of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds and it is also modern football.Every week, there comes a new detail, stat or report of an initiative. Inidually they can be laughed off. What’s the Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli banging on about this time? Who is Fifa’s Gianni Infantino abasing himself in front of now at Davos? Why has the Spanish Super Cup been rejigged with wildly variant appearance fees to try to put on a Clasico for the people of Jeddah? What’s the point of the Champions League group stage?The richest clubs are getting richer within leagues, but the richest leagues are also getting richer in comparison with other leagues. The knockout rounds of this season’s Champions League feature clubs from the five major western European leagues. The last 32 of the Europa League features three clubs from eastern Europe.The past four World Cup winners are all wealthy western European powers (only hapless England remain aloof and even they are improving). Players in those countries grow up with supreme facilities in a highly competitive environment, which may not be without problems but does tend to produce good footballers – as further demonstrated by Spain and Germany’s domination of Uefa youth tournaments.Yet the rich demand more. This month it was reported the European Club Association wants four additional matchdays in the Champions League. Within a week, Pep Guardiola was calling for the abolition of the League Cup to ease the pressure on players. Manchester City’s manager may not agree with the ECA, but it hardly matters.The various plans to streamline the FA Cup follow a similar pattern: having already enriched the rich to the point the smaller clubs can barely compete, the smaller clubs are to be starved of fixtures that generate revenue so the elite can play each other more often and make even more money for themselves.Then there’s the Club World Cup, scheduled to begin in its new expanded format in summer 2021. It is not yet clear European clubs will compete but already the tournament has forced the Africa Cup of Nations to be re-rescheduled from June-July to January-February to avoid a clash.Until last year, that is when the Cup of Nations had traditionally been played before it was moved so as not to interfere with western European club seasons.The Confederation of African Football – which has essentially been run by Fifa since the beginning of August – insists the switch is a specific issue to do with the weather in Cameroon in June. But Cameroon’s climate is not dissimilar to that of Ivory Coast, which will host in 2023. Average June temperature and humidity is much the same in Yaoundé and Abidjan, but June rainfall is almost double in Abidjan. If the rainy season is the issue, the argument to move the 2023 tournament is much stronger. Mid‑January 2023, though, is three weeks after the World Cup final in Qatar. It’s almost as if African football isn’t the main consideration.Fifa’s Infantino, in admittedly vague terms, has spoken of plans for a pan-African league to generate revenue, raise the standard of football across the continent and slow the drain of talent to Europe. That sounds a noble aim and if Fifa’s Club World Cup is to prosper, it requires strong clubs from across the globe. But a super league is a super league and a little probing suggests the idea would be for a closed format. Which raises an immediate question: if you are in effect franchising a league across Africa, can you afford Al Ahly and Zamalek, Hearts of Oak and Kotoko, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs or would the great rivalries that have energised football for generations be lost? Not to mention the impact on clubs slightly further down the pyramid.But perhaps that impact is coming anyway. If European clubs are to play in the Club World Cup, it will require enormous sums of money (the source of which raises a host of ethical concerns). The talk is of £40m-50m just to take part, with a prize fund on top. That will further widen the gulf between rich and poor in Europe, but elsewhere, even if clubs from other confederations get less, the distortion will be seismic.To take just one example, TP Mazembe, who have won seven of the past nine league titles in DR Congo and three of the past 11 African Champions Leagues, have an annual budget of around £8.5m. What happens to Congolese league football when the dominant side is supercharged by the revenues of the Club World Cup?The same pattern, the same enrichment of the rich, the same profanation of domestic leagues, the same shift to a quasi-franchise model is happening everywhere. It could happen globally. The Club World Cup is not about football. It’s about profit, because everything is these days, and Fifa’s battle with Europe’s governing body, Uefa, for control – the game’s regulators become financial competitors.People don’t want to believe. They want to think their club is different. They want simply to watch the game. Haven’t the rich always been dominant? Yes, but to nothing like this extent. What about little Atalanta pipping oligarch-owned Shakhtar? Yes, there are exceptions. It’s football: random stuff still very occasionally happens Leicester’s Premier League title in 2016 is the greatest propaganda the superclubs could ever have dreamed up.Wake up! Turn around, have a look at that climbing frame and ask if this is what you want football to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d77c9a350bd77478321525a09eed8cc6af38f3/0_517_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcc7368196d4b681607e118575c12f79","title":"how has your workplace treated bereaved parents","story":"As paid leave for bereaved parents is being introduced under Jack’s Law, we want to hear what parents experienced at work after they lost a childBereaved parents are now entitled to two weeks’ paid leave from work under the new Jack’s Law.We want to hear from bereaved parents who had to juggle the grief, trauma and practicalities of their child’s death with the demands of their employers.

I work hard, own a home and live a fairly good life. My problem is that I can’t help but feel regretful that I never had children. I can’t quite believe this is how my life turned out. When I was younger I ached for my own child.I have a partner currently. We don’t live together, he’s younger than I am and quite possibly the loveliest man I’ve been in a relationship with. It’s too late for me to conceive now and IVF isn’t an option as we don’t have the money. He says he doesn’t care, but he dotes on friends’ children and I fear that when he’s older he’ll feel regretful, too.In previous relationships I’ve had two abortions and two miscarriages and I’m not sure I ever recovered emotionally. I somehow got my life back on track, though I suffered another miscarriage along the way. Those losses left me feeling numb and I pretend to others who ask that I made positive choices. I feel ashamed, guilty and cowardly.I want to know how to get through these next few years unscathed. I’m too serious, anxious about money, the environment, everything. I suppose I am a typical spinster cat-woman. I fear the emotional wrecking ball of the menopause and want to move on and to not think about what could have been – but it’s getting worse, not better.Mariella replies Don’t panic! It sounds like you are living through a full-blown midlife crisis. No one wants to think they are just a number, but sometimes it’s easier to navigate life’s difficulties when you know you’ve got company – and companions with similar concerns are one thing you won’t be short of as you hit 50, brimful of anxiety, regrets and melancholy. There’s no shame in seeking help and the best place to start is with your local GP, provided they have menopause experience, so they can sort hormonal bedlam from mental wear and tear.You’ve reached the first age of reckoning and you’d be one in a million if there weren’t plenty of choices you’d love to rethink with the benefit of hindsight. I’m afraid that has to stop. There is no gain and a lot to lose in looking over your shoulder instead of keeping your gaze firmly forward-facing. The past is a place to mine for happy memories, not dwell on for those that are less so. It’s easier said than done, but it’s definitely possible. Dwelling on the many things I could have done better, some major, some minor, would definitely flatten me.I’ve front-loaded on the negativity because, quite honestly, the future is far brighter than you envisage. I understand your regrets about not having children and agree the likelihood of getting pregnant now is extremely slim. You can sit around and mourn or consider the surfeit of opportunities offered by not being responsible for anyone but yourself. Whether it’s relocation or re-education, your bucket list is far more achievable than if you were a parent saddled with the cost of an umbilical connection you can’t shake off.A close friend, like you, wanted children, but didn’t have them. Quite honestly, it’s her unfettered lifestyle I envy most when my teenagers make Harry Enfield’s best caricature of adolescent angst seem normal! Instead of rueing your misfortune, write a list of all the amazing things you can do now you’re mature and solvent, grab your younger man and start ticking them off.What’s predictably human is that despite the much longer list of achievements you have to celebrate – a good job, trophy boyfriend, decent lifestyle, own home – you’ve zoomed in on the one ambition you have not succeeded with. They are not minor details to be shunted aside, but amount to the very things that most kids hope one day to achieve.Whatever you choose, the life lesson remains the same. From now on it’s imperative to be grateful for what you’ve got, not preoccupied by what you haven’t. And finally, the menopause… well that’s a whole other conversation, but a good place to begin is on BBC iPlayer with my documentary The Truth About the Menopause. Reaching midlife is a time for contemplation, but also for positive action. With half your life left to live there are options aplenty and inspiring ways to move forward. You just need to review your perspective. • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Your opinions please…I write this as a person rarely wrong. Which, thank you, yes, is a huge thing to carry around, a colossal pressure – I wear my rightness heavily, like a weighted blanket or snood. It is partly this quality of mine, this curse of being such a decent person, one that moves through life so correctly, and with such social grace, that means I so often find myself a gawping tourist on Reddit, specifically the page where people post a scenario from their recent lives and ask: “Am I The Asshole?”Recent posts include: “Am I The Asshole for refusing to go to my cousin’s wedding because she’s making guests pay to enter?” No. Or, “AITA for deglazing my skillet with white wine when making dinner for an ex-alcoholic?” No. “Would I Be The Asshole if I asked my new BF not to wear his mother’s ashes around his neck during sex?” Oh babe. Or, “AITA for performing magic in the office?” Yes. “AITA for cutting contact with my sister and asking for my gifts refunded after she lied about her baby’s gender and her due date?” Hellllll yes you absolute monster. And, “AITA for putting my penis in peanut butter and leaving it in the kitchen?” THE JURY’S OUT, MICHAEL.As with so much of the internet, an entire novel (or obituary) can be read into 100 words. The single problem of a stranger, usually a person so un-selfaware that one wonders what they see when they look in the mirror, reveals uncomfortable truths about their ideas on politics, relationships, gender and hygiene hidden in what appears to be a simple story about sandwiches. And then it reflects back at the reader (there are now almost 2m subscribers, whose handy acronyms have seeped into the wider internet) our own warped concepts of what is right, what is good.“WIBTA,” began another recent post, “if I wrote in my Airbnb review that the host walked in on me in the shower?” The poster, staying in a stranger’s house, where there were no locks on the bathroom doors, was fretting about him thinking she thought him a “predator” if she mentioned the locks issue in her review, after he walked in on her naked, the water loudly running, the door BARRICADED with a BASKET. Would she be the asshole? No. Would she be a perfect illustration of what happens when women are taught to be nice and smile, and think of others first, rather than prioritise their own safety? Yes. Should she read the comments, and cut short her two week stay at this creep’s filthy house? Very much so.And on I read, deep into the night, my phone dying in my hand. There is something very clean and pleasing about seeing the morals of a disparate group of humans charted and structured in such a way: a problem, a collection of solutions, an answer, yes or no. Especially when so many of us walk through life stiff with anxiety over just such problems, problems domestic and seemingly insignificant, ones small enough to keep under our tongue, but which so often get caught in our throats. And especially when there are so many problems in our real lives without a clear solution, problems environmental and existential that fog our vision daily.There is pleasure, too, in the simplicity of judgment. Whether you’re the guy that laughed when his wife spilled a bottle of achingly pumped breast milk, or didn’t tip the delivery boy, or refused to move over a seat in the cinema, or the guy who shaved his wife’s cat, or the one that told his fiancée he wouldn’t be buying an engagement ring as he didn’t want to “set the wrong precedent”, you are an asshole, and that’s that. Unlike being, say, “a shit” though, there is room for improvement – this is not an intrinsic personality trait, instead you are a person who is behaving badly. For, in asking if they are an asshole, they are suggesting there is room for change. And yet there are not gradations of assholery here – when it comes to assholes there are no grey areas posters must take their crown quietly, and with all the dignity permitted to a man who secretly shaves cats. But in this pleasure, there is, of course, darkness.Again, I must reiterate, I am a really good person. Like, lovely. The decisions I make on how to live are sage and elegant and will one day no doubt be collected in a well-illustrated pamphlet, and yet even I, even I wonder about my addiction to this site, to this collection of people trying artlessly to arrive at a moral behaviour. A place that debates and decides how one ought to behave today. I wonder, as I scroll, snorting through strangers questionable interactions with exes, through their obsessions with air conditioning, their clumsy seductions and the secrets they want to keep, I wonder as I so confidently judge their flimsy excuses, could it be... AITA?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f2763f0efa8c50f2ec6b8255405575b2fc09d7/62_582_1513_908/master/1513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb313e9571496990d6b5c3439fc2b017","title":"zoe brock my case against harvey weinstein podcast","story":"Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zoë Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein.

Union Jack flags will also line Parliament Square and the Mall on Friday and the public will see government buildings in Whitehall lit up in red, white and blue.To add to the celebratory mood the government wants to encourage, “a commemorative light display” will be staged in Downing Street in the run-up to 11pm, the hour that the UK will officially end its 47 year membership of Europe’s club of nations. A countdown clock will be projected on to it from 10pm. Officials said the light display will “symbolise the strength and unity” of the four nations that make up the United Kingdom.The prime minister said last night: “Next Friday marks an important moment in the history of our United Kingdom. No matter how you voted in 2016, it is the time to look ahead with confidence to the global, trailblazing country we will become over the next decade and heal past isions. That is what I will be doing on 31 January and I urge everyone across the UK to do the same.”But politicians who fought to remain in the EU said the events were deeply inappropriate. Heseltine told the Observer: “Brexit is the most isive issue of modern times. Those of us who fought to remain did so sincerely in the interests of our country and subsequent generations who we believe should be influential at the heart of Europe.“I think it is unwise of the government to rub our noses in it by celebrating our defeat at this hour, whilst talking about unifying the country.”He said the only comfort was that plans to chime Big Ben to mark the moment the UK leaves had been dropped.“At least we are spared the sound of Big Ben being chimed at our discomfort.” Adapting the quote from John Donne the Tory peer added: “Send not to inquire for whom the bells tolls. It tolls for thee.”The Liberal Democrats’ acting leader, Ed Davey, accused Johnson of using public money for an inappropriate, isive event. “The prime minister should be seeking to pull the country together, not gloat with an expensive party on the public purse,” he said.The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: “It grieves me that we should be leaving the greatest postwar peace project ever created. That is not something we should be celebrating.”Sometime during the night on Friday, the union flag will be quietly removed from outside the European Parliament buildings in Strasbourg and Brussels, and from the UK representation in Brussels, which will be renamed in due course.Claude Moraes, who has served as a Labour MEP for more than 20 years and will attend the European Parliament for the last time on Thursday, said the government events to mark Brexit were wrong. “All this make me feels very uneasy. The country is still bruised and ided. The British thing to do would be to mark the occasion in a way that respects the views of both sides, and that recognises the national ide.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26203f3b47cdc6e0614c7ce16ad04e03adeb3362/0_114_5884_3530/master/5884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaf1bfbfe38bb5877e15331161ac7667","title":"farewell europe the long road to brexit","story":"Last week, with the end of the UK’s 47-year membership of the club of European nations just days away, I looked back at some newspaper cuttings from my time as a Brussels correspondent. A picture of worried-looking farmers eyeing up their cattle at a market in Banbury stared out alongside banner headlines. “British beef banned in Europe. Cattle prices fall. School meals hit. EU ‘rules’ broken.” Among the many crises in British relations with the EU down the years – from Margaret Thatcher’s bust-up over the European budget in the early 1980s to the UK’s exit from the ERM in 1992 – the beef war between London and Brussels ranks among the biggest.It was 29 March, 1996, and the European commission had just announced a worldwide ban on the export of British beef. The EU’s executive opted for decisive action after the Tory government admitted there could be a link between “mad cow” disease and the mutant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which could kill humans. I had been in Brussels less than three months. It was a huge story, and reading through articles I had written at the time, it felt like yesterday. But what was most striking, as my mind fixed again on events of 24 years ago, was how relevant that one prolonged and tortuous episode seemed today, in the context of Brexit.When the European commission dropped its bombshell, France and Germany had already imposed their own unilateral bans on British beef. UK ministers had announced that millions of cattle across the UK would have to be slaughtered. Thousands of schools took meat off their lunch menus. Beef prices tumbled. Inevitably, in those testy post-Maastricht days of Tory rows over Europe, Eurosceptic MPs blamed the Europeans. The late Sir Teddy Taylor, a hardline anti-EU campaigner on the Conservative backbenches, urged retaliation in the form of a ban on French wine and French beef, while Bill Cash, still a Tory MP to this day, wanted to take the European commission to court.Throughout that spring and summer, the crisis widened. This was a time when the ambitions of the EU’s true believers in Brussels, Bonn and Paris were at their height. Helmut Kohl and Jacques Chirac were planning the launch of the euro, for the big leap towards political and monetary union that the Maastricht treaty had charted a course. Europe’s leaders were preparing also to admit several countries of former communist eastern Europe. The enlargement project was one of which the UK thoroughly approved. The British government believed in a Europe that was “wider not deeper”.But John Major, who had launched his premiership in 1990 with a promise to put Britain “at the heart of Europe”, found himself trapped politically as the BSE disaster worsened. The rightwing tabloids were in full anti-EU cry, demanding he fight the beef ban like he was Margaret Thatcher. In an editorial at the end of March, the Sun warned that the survival of an independent UK, no less, was at stake: “If Brussels has the power to stop Britain from selling a product anywhere in the world, then we are no longer an independent sovereign nation with control over our own affairs,” the paper said. “We are just one of the herd. John Bull has been neutered.”Back home, Tony Blair and New Labour were racing ahead in the polls. On 21 May, Major went for broke and, to try to calm the “bastards” in his own party, announced that the UK would refuse to co-operate in EU meetings until further notice. British non-co-operation with Europe – and its policies – had become official policy.It was no small move to make. In areas where British ministers had a veto in council meetings, non-co-operation meant they would effectively be blocking EU decisions, thwarting European plans for deeper integration. In mid-May 1996 Major told the House of Commons: “Without progress towards lifting the ban we cannot be expected to cooperate normally on other Community business. We cannot continue business as usual within Europe when we are faced with the clear disregard by some of our partners of reason, of common sense and of Britain’s national interest.”Non co-operation quickly took relations between London and Brussels to a historic low. For the first time in more than two decades serious questions were being asked about Britain’s membership, publicly, by senior British and European politicians. The beef crisis in itself was an isolated, very specific issue. But the way it had spiralled had highlighted deep faultlines in a relationship between a member state determined not to cede powers, and much of whose media was virulently anti-Brussels, and the proponents of a postwar European project that had as its entire purpose the unification of Europe, and the necessary surrender by participants of ever more sovereignty to the centre.EU leaders were beginning to wonder if the UK could continue as a full member if it was prepared to put ners in the works of integration whenever it had a grievance. In a newspaper article in early June 1996 the then European commission president Jacques Santer warned that “l’heure de vérité” was approaching. The late Sir Leon Brittan, then the UK’s commissioner, sensing a potentially disastrous breach, told UK businessmen in the same week to start speaking up for Europe “if we are not to be lured, step by insidious step, on the dangerous path towards leaving the European Union”.This coming Friday, 31 January, at midnight in Brussels, and 11pm UK time, it will all be over. The worst fears of the pro-Europeans here and on the continent will have been realised. The Union flag will be lowered overnight, discreetly at the European parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg and at the UK representation in Brussels. The UK will be out. The flag that will fly until Friday in the EU capital’s parliament building will be moved to the House of European History museum nearby. British membership will thereafter be a piece of history on display. In London, Boris Johnson’s Conservative government will project the moment as the beginning of a new dawn. No 10 will stage a special lights display at 11pm. Ten million commemorative 50p coins will come into circulation before the end of the year. Johnson will be one of the first to receive one.For those of us who have spent so many years watching the UK’s relationship with the EU closely, the final act of leaving will be hard to take in. In the minds of everyone in the EU who had always wanted the relationship to succeed, there will always be deep regrets, and questions that can never fully be answered. Could it have worked? If so, was the EU or the UK, or were both, to blame? Which British and EU leaders fell short? Or was it always doomed to failure?As we prepare to leave, I asked diplomats, politicians, journalists on both sides of the channel why they thought Brexit had come to pass and they cited a multitude of reasons. The deep differences in postwar attitudes between the UK and its European partners poor leadership in the EU and UK a constantly hostile British media, and sheer bad luck and timing.Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former UK ambassador to the EU and Washington, believes all these factors played their parts. “Europe always seemed a matter of choice, not necessity for the UK, unlike for France and Germany,” he said. “Successive generations of British political leaders failed to explain the realities and the centrality of our membership, preferring to live with, rather than confront, decades of British media little-Englandism. Then the short-term perfect storm – the impact of the financial crisis, the anti-establishment mood, and the open goal left by Cameron’s casual failure of leadership and Corbyn’s Euroscepticism.“Brexit was never inevitable, and the irony is that we are leaving an organisation more aligned than at any time since we joined with the British priorities of free trade, competition, active and responsible international policies, and cooperation on security.”The German MP Norbert Röttgen, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, suggested the idea of the UK leaving was always so alien and nightmarish for EU leaders that they blinded themselves to the warning signals. By the time of the 2016 referendum the chance to find compromise had been lost.“For the EU it was unimaginable that a country might choose to leave the union,” Röttgen said. “As a consequence they underestimated the severity of the situation and gave David Cameron nothing to work with during the referendum. To be fair, given all the opt-outs the UK already had, that would not have been easy, but the EU’s lack of trying was a mistake.” The German MEP David McAllister, born to a Scottish father and German mother, and who was bought up in West Berlin, says the UK’s decision to opt out of the euro and Schengen open borders agreement was a turning point which took the UK down a road to disengagement from the core. “The beginning of the end was Maastricht. Not joining the two biggest projects, the joint currency and Schengen.” But enlargement to the east – which, ironically, the UK had championed – also played its part, he believes, creating huge new issues around freedom of movement which the UK could not resolve with its partners before the eventual referendum. “Free movement was vital for those new members and they did not want to give way.”As in any marriage there were happier times. After Edward Heath had taken the UK into the European Economic Community in 1973, successive prime ministers – Thatcher, Major, Blair, Gordon Brown – all entered office proclaiming themselves strong Europeans. Even Cameron said he wanted his party to stop “banging on” about Europe. In 1975, addressing the Conservative Group for Europe, before the confirmatory referendum later that year, Thatcher proudly proclaimed her pro-EC views, and taunted Labour over its European isions. “We are inextricably part of Europe,” she said. “Neither Mr Foot nor Mr Benn nor anyone else will ever be able to take us ‘out of Europe’, for Europe is where we are and where have always been,” she declared.But for every UK prime minister since the 1970s, rows with Europe were always round the corner. In her first years in No 10 Thatcher fought and won a bruising battle to cut the UK’s payments to the European budget, before securing the EU rebate at Fontainbleu in 1984. After that, however, she was a tireless champion of the European single market, before falling out with Jacques Delors and Helmut Kohl over their plans for full monetary union in the late 1980s.Charles Powell, her foreign policy adviser at the time, says her European enthusiasm went in phases. “Rather like Picasso she had her blue and her pink phases,” Powell says. “For five-and-a-half years she was very awkward over the budget. After 1984, however, it was more positive as she drove the single market forward. Then she felt betrayed over the single currency.” But he insists she never contemplated leaving the EU.Many in the EU believe it was Thatcher who set the direction of travel. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, says she introduced the idea of “exceptionalism” (rebates and opt-outs) which undermined Europe’s unity and efficiency.“It started with the rebate of Thatcher,” he said. “By granting something like the rebate you encourage those who don’t want or like the basic story of the European Union. The consequence is that the EU is not effective because of these exceptions. It cannot act there, it can only partially act here. That then fuels the Eurosceptics again, who say ‘you see it doesn’t work!’ By creating these exceptions we planted a seed to make the EU ineffective, and for the exiteers to make their case.”For Major, who succeeded Thatcher, the crises never ceased. The UK’s exit from the ERM in autumn 1992 was one from which he never really recovered. He fought and secured the single currency opt-out from Maastricht but the “bastards” in his party never let up. In the later days of his administration he tried to convince EU leaders to adopt ideas for a two-speed Europe in which the UK would be in the slower lane but, by that stage, they were waiting for Blair to win the 1997 election and open a new period of positive relations.I can remember the excitement in EU circles at Blair’s first European summit in late May 1997 after 18 years of Thatcher and Major. At that meeting in Noordwijk in the Netherlands the Italian news agency, Ansa, headed its main report “Tony Blair, Superstar” and Italian journalists called it “Blair day in Europe”. Labour’s election manifesto had left open the possibility of the UK joining the euro when the conditions were right. Blair was genuine and serious about wanting to change the mood.But he had won the support of Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers, including the Sun, for the 1997 election and Alastair Campbell clearly spotted danger. Campbell arrived on the European scene appearing disdainful, no doubt deliberately, of many of the EU’s complex and arcane debates, describing them as “eurobollocks”, because he feared a tabloid backlash if Blair was too pro-EU.At the same meeting in Noordwijk he accused me of “going native” for writing about voting systems in the EU, which he had not by then got his head around.There was a smugness about the Blair administration – remarked on by his own officials at the time – in its early dealings with the EU, which infuriated European leaders. Within months, rows blew up between Blair and Brown on the UK side, and Kohl and Chirac on the other, as the UK demanded the right to be present at meetings of European finance ministers whose countries had agreed to join the euro, despite the UK having refused to commit itself to entry.At one summit in Luxembourg, Chirac became so irritated that he told Blair he would have to learn to bow his head three times to the tricolore before he could earn his spurs in the EU. The greatest frustration came when EU leaders realised that Brown had, with his adviser Ed Balls, designed a foolproof means of blocking Blair from joining the euro, through his five tests. Verhofstadt and other leaders say Blair, whose relations with Chirac and others deteriorated further with the Iraq war, had a chance to change the course of history but fell short. And so after Brown’s difficult premiership, in which he promoted his ideas of Britishness far more than any European vision, came Cameron, who had launched his bid for the Tory leadership with a pledge to take the UK out of the main centre-right grouping, the European People’s party, positioning himself initially as a firm Eurosceptic. When he called the 2016 inout referendum he promised to renegotiate a better deal for the UK in the EU that he hoped would persuade people to vote to remain. The rest is history.He failed to secure sufficient concessions from the EU to win over fellow Tories, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who would campaign to leave. Cameron opened the door to a British exit and the British people walked through it on 23 June, 2016.Cameron is the name most often cited in the EU as people search for iniduals to blame for Brexit. Röttgen says: “At a critical time, when the UK needed true leadership it had poor political personnel in place. David Cameron proved to be a coward, lacking the kind of statesmanship John Major had demonstrated during his term.”But Röttgen knows, as does everyone, that it was the entire European political class that failed to stop the “unimaginable” happening. His fellow countryman McAllister – with British and German roots – is more mournful ahead of Brexit day. “It will be very sad,” he says. “I hardly know anyone who welcomes this and who will not miss the British, their pragmatism, their humour, their knowledge. January 31 will be a very emotional day. I do not want to be in Brussels on the day the Union Jack is taken down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c3c39454c3ce6aca3d0e801d904b821a54c2fce/0_67_3145_1887/master/3145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68aa5c6475989763a2bc3a891ca64b72","title":"priti patel radicalised youth plan so flawed its mad","story":"A Home Office-funded study into tackling radicalisation among young people has concluded that the approach being pushed through by the home secretary, Priti Patel, is so flawed that it is “madness”.Instead the research, which will be unveiled on Wednesday and is described as one of the biggest scientific surveys of its type in Europe, found that the most effective strategy was precisely the opposite approach pursued by Patel. Generating “positive psychology” among young people was found to be significantly more effective than punitive policies when challenging “violent youth radicalisation”, defined as gang crime through to the development of extreme ideologies.Its conclusions contradict Patel’s hardline approach, typified by measures announced last week that emphasised longer jail terms for violent and terrorist offenders, lie-detector tests and increased monitoring.Rather than rolling out more draconian measures to contain “risk”, the Youth Empowerment and Innovation Project, part funded by the Home Office, found that offering encouragement to youngsters and addressing factors such as social exclusion was a better way to mitigate violent youth radicalisation.The findings will be unveiled this week at an international conference at the University of East London’s school of psychology with speakers including the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, officials from the European Commission and prominent academics.However, Home Office enthusiasm for the project has, say sources, cooled over the past year under Sajid Javid and Patel, who succeeded Javid as home secretary last July. No minister from the Home Office has so far accepted an invitation to appear at the conference.“Unfortunately the Home Office, which was supposed to lead on this project, has disengaged over the last year,” said Professor Theo Gavrielides, who led the three-year study.Gavrielides, whose researchers interviewed 3,540 young people and professionals in schools, youth prisons, universities, migrant centres and online, said the UK government’s policy of managing risk and profiling possible offenders was backfiring.“The research provides new evidence that by attempting to profile and predict violent youth radicalisation, we may in fact be breeding the very reasons that lead those at risk to violent acts.The project, piloted in schools, universities and youth offending institutions, found that when young people were encouraged to develop a talent or pastime, the radicalisation process was successfully challenged.Gavrielides added: “Our project showed a positive way of engaging youth at risk, tapping into their talents rather than treating them as society risks.”He added there were significant economic benefits with the average £80,000 annual cost of keeping an inidual in a Youth Offending Institute sufficient to fund the same young person to the best university for three years.His research also received funding from the EU’s Erasmus+ programme as well as other public bodies from across Europe and was coordinated by the IARS International Institute.Professor Aneta Tunariu, dean of the school of psychology at the University of East London, said: “The YEIP represents a remarkable milestone in our collective understanding and approach to tackling the psychosocial conditions that overshadow and silence life-hope and its primordial place for human flourishing, fuelling marginalisation, misunderstandings, injustice and ultimately anger and ision.”Unveiling her new measures last week, Patel said the government had faced “hard truths” since the London Bridge attack in November, which was carried out by convicted terrorist Usman Khan out on licence from prison.Among the measures included in a bill to be brought before parliament by mid-March was a minimum jail term of 14 years for serious crimes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

On Friday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NHS was “ready to respond appropriately” to any cases.Dove told the  that although he did not feel unwell, he would like to rule himself out and he believed the government could be doing more to contact those in his position.: “If they want to track us down, why don’t they make it easier for us to contact them?“The only way they are going to find me is by checking the flight records. They’ve got to be quite clever because there are not that many direct flights to Wuhan. Most people get to Wuhan through a hub airport.”It would save the government “a lot of hard work” tracking flights and movements in and out of Wuhan if they allowed people to self-report. “It would be better if they just said, ‘contact us on this number’, and I could call them up and say, ‘I’m one of the people you’re looking for,’ but there is nothing.”Dove flew back to Heathrow from China via Hong Kong and said no information was given out at any point. He said he was not worried either before he flew over or while he was in China. “Before I went I had heard there were cases of pneumonia and people were saying it could be SARS, but my colleagues at the university said it was happening really far away form them. Wuhan is a very big city. It’s bigger than greater London.”On Friday, Whitty said there was a “fair chance” cases would emerge in Britain as the number of cases reported worldwide rose to more than 1,300, including 41 deaths – all in China. Speaking after a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday, the chief medical officer said: “I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.“I think we should definitely see this as a marathon, not a sprint. We need to have our entire response based on that principle.”The Department of Health confirmed it was trying to find “as many passengers as we can” who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing.A spokeswoman said work was ongoing to get the information needed to contact all relevant people, adding it is “quite a long process” and will take some time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695e5f4332f1285b4ec0cf3a3dc3db3bf407490d/181_0_3241_1944/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3114639861988be6ac84a5fbea4db38","title":"what is the coronavirus wuhan china virus symptoms","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the China virus and at what point should you go to the doctor?It is a novel coronavirus – that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 24 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 1,000 cases and 41 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the 14 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.It was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a “pneumonia of unknown cause” which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation.In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal scientists were already racing to uncover the source.The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed.There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread.Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested.“Before there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,” Xia told the Observer.But the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.That was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country’s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be “resolutely contained”.Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either.Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks.Work has already started on the first, and given China’s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale.And in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year.By the time lunar new year’s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a “level 1” health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.Yet all this may come too late to ward off a major public health crisis, infectious disease experts have warned. Yi Guan, a senior Hong Kong-based virologist who helped identify the cause of the Sars virus, said he was much more worried about this disease, and feared the window for controlling its spread might already have closed.“I’ve never felt scared. This time I’m scared,” Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong’s state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases, told China’s influential Caixin magazine.He visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a “war footing” but instead was met with chaos and incompetence.“I don’t think the local government has done what it should do,” he said. “They haven’t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving.”The coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China’s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet – up to 3 billion trips – as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes.For the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind.Even as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual.Evidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported.But widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country – even in places far from the centre or any reported cases – people were cancelling their party plans and staying home.Streets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai’s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism – domestic and foreign – will be suspended.Instead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China’s vibrant but censored social media. In early January, eight people were arrested for “spreading hoaxes” about what came to be known as the coronavirus, AFP reported.Weeks later, vast numbers of people were turning to the internet for information about the crisis, as state media downplayed it and kept it off the front page of official papers, such as the People’s Daily, and out of the main headlines on key television news programmes.On Saturday, discussion about the disease on micro-blogging site Weibo had reached 8 billion views, according to the What’s on Weibo website. “It’s very rare to see news topics get this big,” site editor Manya Koetse said on Twitter.By Saturday evening, China had confirmed it was dealing with a total of 1,372 confirmed cases, and a death toll of 41. Together with cases identified outside China – spread from Australia to the United States and France – more than 1,400 people have been infected. By comparison, during the main Sars epidemic, which lasted from late 2002 until July 2003, in total 8,098 people got sick, and 774 died.Although most of the victims who have died from this new coronavirus have been older, and some have been in bad health, more people could be at risk if overwhelmed hospitals are not able to treat those with the disease. There is no cure or vaccine, but medical support can help patients’ own immune systems to fight the disease.Xia – who is no longer feverish but has a bad cough, often producing blood – says she is comforted by the actions of the central government now in taking control.“At this point I think the focus should be on how, together, we’re going to pull through,” she said. But she thinks Wuhan officials will bear the brunt of scrutiny in coming weeks and months.“There can be no doubt they simply missed the best time for containing the outbreak,” she said. “The Wuhan government didn’t offer timely and effective support to hospitals in terms of medical materials … they failed to raise awareness among the public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b8ddbea84a0fc7866ca0216c19ee80b2cc6622/0_138_2120_1273/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49cbc28cf6cc78ea7bae89cc9dcb358","title":"social workers tell us how you feel about your job","story":"Take part in our survey to have your say about the profession and the wider sectorWhat’s it like to be a social worker in the UK right now?We have launched the latest edition of the  Jobs Social Lives survey into the issues affecting staff at all stages of their careers – from the frontline to management.The research, carried out by Ipsos Mori on behalf of the  and new regulator Social Work England, is an opportunity to have your say about issues including workloads, pay and how the profession is viewed.Our last Social Lives study, published in 2017, found more than four-fifths of participants were proud of what they do, and more than three-quarters said they enjoyed their jobs, but most thought their caseloads were too high.Help us to find out whether the picture has changed.

She now specialises in palliative care, partly because it is centred on the patient rather than on any disease. It is impossible to overstate the qualities that make Clarke a first-rate doctor: sympathetic intelligence, kindness, a sense of humour. And she is one of those crucial people who will not settle for second best.Has working at a hospice changed your attitude to dying?Working close to death has shaped my relationship with life. We all know we are a spark, a little flash in the pan and will be obliterated before we know it. We know that, we ignore it, we live our life in spite of it. We squander this incredibly precious commodity – the time slipping through our fingers – from the moment we are born. The most powerful thing I come away from the hospice with every single day is the realisation that every moment matters. Genuinely, I couldn’t give a damn about wrinkles or middle age or putting on weight or my first grey hairs or reading specs – these are reasons to celebrate. I am so lucky I have them.Your father, a GP, inspired you – what was memorable about him?I always had that feeling of him as a colossus I could turn to, no matter what the problem. When he was four or five weeks away from death and very frail, he saw how filthy my car windscreen was when I’d driven to see him and – apologies because it might make me cry – all of a sudden, our roles flipped. I’d been caring for him. But he said: “Rachel – how can you see out of that?” And I said: “I don’t really do cars – my husband does.” And he said: “For God’s sake, you’re a woman in your 40s.” And he insisted on getting out a plastic container of screen-wash and a little funnel because, being Dad, all these things were meticulously arranged. He was so frail, he could hardly lift the bonnet and pour in the detergent. It took him 20 minutes. Yet he was being the colossus again. And I had this childish involuntary pang: I don’t want to lose that in my life. It is two years since his death and he is always there in my head but it’s rare to allow myself to think about him because it’s too painful. Isn’t it incredible how enduring the pain of losing someone you love is?And this gave you a new take on your work in the hospice?I needed that education about grief as a human being and as a doctor. Medical students are spat out into a world where people are dying – facing things beyond their experience. It is hard. They should be offered counselling but aren’t. Fledgling doctors-to-be learn the job of being a doctor is to rise above emotions. Talking about this issue should be part of medical education. Some doctors disapprove of what they see as a fluffy trend but it is not soft to confront this, it is the hardest thing to do – to find the strength to be detached while maintaining your humanity.So you need professional detachment and empathy?There is a moment in the book when I talk about seeing a toddler being successfully resuscitated. I came away in awe of the fact that this dead child had been resurrected by this crack team, moving like a machine – it was phenomenal. I’d been crying on the sidelines and, watching them, felt a sudden desire to be machine-like because I could see how the ordinary emotions of an untrained person could stop a life being saved. Yet empathy is also essential. In our digital age, listening can seem a rebellious and subversive act.Did working in TV give you anything you could take into medicine?Enormously so. The heart of good journalism and the heart of good medicine is in some way the same. They are both fundamentally about relationships with people and listening to and respecting people’s stories. So the human story is the heart of journalism. It is not the facts and figures. The facts and figures come to life to a reader through the story – that is what makes them care. And equally, in medicine, in every conceivable way, the human story matters.As well as being drawn to the patient-centred aspect of palliative care, does the hard medicine also appeal?Palliative medicine is an opportunity to practise the kind of medicine that should be universal. Isn’t it interesting that you have to be a child or actively dying in the UK to be at the centre of a medical world? I do also love the pathophysiology, the interface of hard science. In palliative care, you’re often caring for patients whose body systems are failing – their physiology is deranged, which makes the challenges of pain management much more complicated.You talk about a “failure of nerve” in the medical profession about dying…Commentators say the problem is that death is taboo. My experience is different. Doctors’ failure of nerve is not about them shrinking from a fearful topic, it is that they don’t want to hurt patients and their families.You offer no view on assisted dying…I’m not flinching from this incredibly important debate but my relationship with my patients has to come first. I would not wish to have a platform about assisted dying that made patients fearful that it was something I had in mind for them.• Dear Life is published by Little Brown (£16.99).

An attacking option if Eddie Jones is minded to re-deploy Elliot Daly, Furbank has flourished under Saints’ New Zealand coach, Chris Boyd.The 21-year-old No 8 has stood out this season in a Leinster team stuffed with internationals. Rangy and quick, Doris is a powerful runner who showed his all-round game in the back-to-back European Cup wins over Northampton last month, when he ran a total of 140 metres from 32 carries and made 29 tackles.The 22-year-old Glasgow flanker is one of four uncapped players in the squad who were born overseas, in his case New Zealand. Gordon qualifies for Scotland through his grandparents and has the national attribute of being a pest over the ball, hard to shift and knowing which breakdowns to attack.The 22-year-old Montpellier wing moved to France from Cameroon when he was nine and has been capped at under-20 level. He is one of 20 uncapped players named in the original squad of 42. N’Gandebe is a finisher with instant acceleration who can find space in the tightest of spots.The 21-year-old Zebre fly-half impressed at under-20 level. His rise is timely with Italy needing to find more creativity and finishing power behind their pack. Biondelli, who has also played at full-back, is making his mark in a struggling side, although his elevation after 11 appearances for his club was a surprise.The 18-year-old wing has scored 10 tries in as many starts for Gloucester this season and was sounded out by England before the country of his birth came calling. One for the future, perhaps, but Wales under Warren Gatland blooded players young, and Rees-Zammit would add excitement.The South Africa international finished his playing career with Treviso and coached the club for six years from 2007. He has been appointed interim coach for the Six Nations after the early departure of Conor O’Shea. His task is huge: it is five years since the Azzurri won a match in the Six Nations.An experienced coach after stints with Saracens, England, the Lions and Ireland under Joe Schmidt, Farrell is now in charge for the first time. A year ago, Ireland were riding high after following the grand slam with victory over New Zealand, but they slipped last year and a man who established his reputation as a defence coach needs to refine Ireland’s attack.Galthié is a former France captain who has been charged with turning a team that has been Six Nations also-rans since 2010 into one of the leading teams in the world by the time France host the World Cup in 2023. The new coach has invested in youth but is looking to the past to recapture the swagger of Les Bleus while defence coach, Shaun Edwards, will add steel.The fourth New Zealander to coach Wales in the last 21 years after Graham Henry, Steve Hansen and Gatland. His brief is to retain Wales’ meanness in defence while sharpening their attack and will be judged on the success of his predecessor Gatland rather than the state of the regional game. With games in Dublin and Twickenham, there will be no honeymoon for the former Scarlets coach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50992daa85adcd53fa78800f36cd96ec7bebd214/0_53_3576_2145/master/3576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2cdfe713dc7fa222d44d21879af9552","title":"south africa v england fourth test day three live","story":"49th over: South Africa 123-7 (de Kock 43, Pretorius 20) Pretorius softens his hands to guide Broad to the third man boundary. South Africa need 201 to avoid the follow on, though I’m almost certain England won’t enforce it anyway.“Good morning Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “I noticed numerous quotes yesterday, mostly in Latin, attributed to Virgil. This reminded me that Michael Vaughan was apparently nicknamed ‘Virgil’ for his likeness to the Thunderbirds character, whose specialist expertise of course included demolition, heavy lifting and logistics, but not, to my knowledge, Latin.”Ha. That’s one for the Forgotten Nicknames XI. Since reading your email I’ve experienced a Proustian rush of memories from 2003 – mainly of my old Channel 4 editor, Duncan Steer, referring to Virgil Vaughan. I’m right there, right now, in a proto-hipster office in Camden with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ debut album playing in the background. And my hair is to die for. All that from a nickname. 48th over: South Africa 119-7 (de Kock 43, Pretorius 16) A short blast of hot hot heat from Wood. An excellent short ball to de Kock takes a leading edge and lands safely in front of Wood. He follows that with a full-length ball that finds the edge and flies through the vacant third slip area for four.“Such is Mark Wood’s charisma that I give an extra two pounds to the Big Issue seller who bears an extremely striking resemblance to him,” says James Debens. “You know, the one with the immaculate dentistry who stands outside Co-op and has an iPhone XR that he checks on the sly (a self-confessed player of the OBO perhaps)?”47th over: South Africa 113-7 (de Kock 37, Pretorius 16) Broad replaces Woakes and almost strikes with his first ball, which de Kock edges a fraction short of first slip. Then Pretorius, who has started imperiously, drives Broad to the cover boundary with a flourish. He has 16 from 11 balls.“Hi Rob,” says Bill Hargreaves. “Jolly good morning to you. I’m christening a new tea pot - with pictures of cows on the side. That is a lovely interview between Ward, Wood and Broad. (Lovely name for a legal practice, too.) It might be naive of me, but I think I enjoy watching a victory if I think the chaps have conducted themselves decently, although I’m totally against judgement (part of my profession), if that isn’t an oxymoron. I think that all possible misdemeanours should be judged against: 1) was it premeditated 2) was it done to attempt to gain competitive advantage. Any issue not gaining both strikes should be struck off, especially when the chap apologises as nicely as Ben Stokes did.”46th over: South Africa 108-7 (de Kock 36, Pretorius 12) I don’t know about you, but I assumed Mark Wood’s Test career was over, so this is such an uplifting development. He’s getting on a wee bit - he turned 30 earlier in the month - but he’s now a serious option for the tours of India and Australia next year. If he can play three of the five Tests in each of those series, England will be very happy. They might even win a game!Back in the year 2020, de Kock drives Wood confidently for three. Pretorius sees that stroke and raises it with a lovely drive for four. With a first-class average of 37.50, he’s a bit overqualified to beat at No9. 45th over: South Africa 100-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 7) Pretorius thumps Woakes through mid-off for four. And why not?44th over: South Africa 95-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 2) Wood bowls a maiden to de Kock. Decent pace, mainly in the high 80s. He’ll be desperate for another five-for this morning.“‘Internally I was buzzing but externally you’ve got to act cool, tap the pitch and stuff like that,’” says Abhijato Sensarma, quoting Mark Wood’s interview before play. “This reminds me of the time my club sent me out as a 10-year-old pinch-hitting opener. I was the youngest guy in the side and their regular No11. So when almost an hour later I was the last to be dismissed after making a stoic 20-something while all the adolescents collapsed at the other end, I received a thousand unlikely pats on my back for my batting. The opposition collapsed too, but eventually won with only a wicket to spare. It was terrible cricket, yet it was wonderful.”43rd over: South Africa 95-7 (de Kock 33, Pretorius 2) South Africa are a mess. It’s sad to see, and also a little bewildering given how well they played in the first two Tests.Chris Woakes will open the bowling, a nice reward for a high-class performance yesterday. And he needs only three balls to take the first wicket of the day! It was a poor delivery in truth, well outside leg stump, but Woakes won’t care. Philander tried to help it on its way, was through the shot too early and got a leading edge to mid-off.42nd over: South Africa 88-6 (de Kock 32, Philander 0) Wood has one delivery remaining of his ninth over, having dismissed Nortje with the last ball of yesterday’s play. He bowls it to the new batsman Vernon Philander, who defends solidly.Mark Wood makes the world a better place departmentThere’s a lovely interview with Wood and Stuart Broad on Sky right now.Mark Wood Ah, it’s nice to get a few. I’ll take it. ‘Genuine allrounder’ - I’ll take it.Ian Ward Now, did you allow your wife to speak you last night or were you too busy watching yourself on the highlights?Mark Wood I got the highlights in, don’t worry about that! Ah it was good, I actually gave Sarah a mention in the press conference. They said, ‘You’ve done a bit of work on your batting’ and I said, ‘Ah my wife fed us on the bowling machine a few times’, so I think we’re even.Ian Ward (pointing at Broad) You were on time for this interview, he wasn’t. Why?Broad I mean, to quote Mark Wood in the changing-room: ‘When I’m playing this well, the press can wait for me!’Wood You two have set me up an absolute treat here! Wow.Broad He is playing well though.Ward What was your favourite shot?Wood Ah, the six over cover! Internally I was buzzing but externally you’ve got to act cool, tap the pitch and stuff like that.Morning. Even the pessimists think this is a done deal. England were so dominant yesterday that it’s hard to see anything other than a third consecutive victory. If that happens, it will be the first time since the 1954-55 Ashes that England have come from behind to win an overseas series 3-1. Then, as now, one of the stars was an injury-prone fast bowler. Mark Wood doesn’t sledge people by quoting Wordsworth, as Frank Tyson did, but they do have the same appetite for destruction and ability to bowl in excess of 95mph. And although his record is nowhere near as good - Tyson averaged 18.56 from his 17 Tests - Wood’s performances since his recall in St Lucia last year have evoked the mythical devastation of Tyson in that Ashes series.It’s a small sample size, for sure, but 12 wickets at 14.75 is eyecatching stuff. He was far too hot for South Africa yesterday, taking three of the six wickets that fell in the evening session, and he’ll be eyeing another five-for this morning. South Africa will resume on 88 for six, still 312 runs behind in a match they need to win. It’s a long way back from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41ec01939a32a80e263ebdcfe8043b3c26449b8/0_585_3732_2239/master/3732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c095abb5e40baa571f2e40bfc2cc3c7a","title":"royal ballet onegin john cranko english national ballet enb 70th anniversary gala natalia osipova","story":"Royal Opera House Coliseum, LondonNatalia Osipova leads an unforgettable revival of John Cranko’s take on Pushkin. And English National Ballet’s celebrations bring back happy memoriesWhen the BalletBoyz, Michael Nunn and William Trevitt, recently filmed the Royal Ballet’s version of Kenneth MacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet for cinema and TV release, they subtitled it “Beyond Words”. Which is a characteristically clever bit of marketing, because the strange thing about ballet is that it really can, at its very best, reach the parts other arts do not even begin to touch.Take last Saturday’s performance, by the Royal Ballet again, of John Cranko’s Onegin. On the surface, Pushkin’s masterly narrative poem is a strange choice for a dance treatment. It is all about the words, the rhythm and the heft of them, their subtle, enticing shape – and its plot pivots around two critical letters.One is sent by the young, dreamy country girl Tatiana to the smouldering city sophisticate Onegin. His rejection of the love it contains triggers a duel and tragedy. The second is sent by Onegin himself, many years later, when he returns to St Petersburg after a wasted life, and once again meets Tatiana, now married and a sophisticated and beautiful society matron. He longs to win her back – and sends her a letter pleading for her love. She rejects him, even though she still loves him, choosing honour and loyalty over passion.There are a lot of words in there. But the brilliance of Cranko’s balletic adaptation (created in 1965, then revised two years later) is that it turns them into scenes of pure and communicative dance. With the help of Jürgen Rose’s evocative designs, which move from the lime green and russet of Tatiana’s country home to the lush reds and pinks of a high society soiree, and a score stitched together from Tchaikovsky pieces by Kurt-Heinz Stolze, Cranko conjures an entire world.Some of his effects are strongly expressionistic. When Tatiana writes to Onegin, she dreams him into being he enters her room and her imagination through a mirror. When Onegin and his friend, the poet Lensky, fight a duel, Tatiana and her sister Olga try to intervene in clinging arabesques and rapid jumps, smothering Lensky’s body with their despair. Other ideas are more naturalistic: the gentle expansiveness of the love duet between Olga and Lensky, and the serene beauty of Tatiana’s own pas de deux with her husband, Gremin, are satisfying depictions of requited love, content in its own world. Through it all, the corps de ballet skips and jumps, using conventional balletic language to frame the psychodramas unfolding at the story’s heart.To make its mark, though, Onegin needs performances as full of understanding as the choreography. On Saturday night it got them. Natalia Osipova is a dream of a Tatiana, plunging deep into her Russian soul. She marks each stage of the character’s development with a performance simultaneously full of detail and abandon her final desolation when she pushes Onegin away as he flings himself repeatedly in a curl around her body is heartbreaking.As Onegin, Reece Clarke, who at 24 has only just been promoted to first soloist, acquits himself well in a part that perhaps has more gravitas than he can currently summon. But he partners Osipova strongly, never interrupting the fevered flow of the dream sequence by making any of its high lifts look difficult. He also etches his own sharp lines powerfully across the stage, with refined jumps and ferocious pirouettes.Olga and Lensky are equally well drawn and well danced. Matthew Ball brings to the hot-blooded poet a joy in his love for Francesca Hayward’s airy Olga that explains exactly why he reacts so strongly when she flirts with another man as they dance together their bodies seem to curve with the force of their love. His melancholy solo in the face of his death is gripping her incomprehension bleak. Gary Avis lends Gremin just the right tender solicitude. There are other performances with many casts, but this was a night to remember.So was the first time I saw Onegin, when it was in the repertoire of English National Ballet and featured a devastating central performance from guest artist Natalia Makarova. That memory flooded back at ENB’s gala to celebrate its 70th anniversary, as did thoughts of sitting through Harald Lander’s Études – formal variations on a ballet class – which was often on the bill when I was watching the company then known as Festival Ballet while I was growing up.To mark its birthday, the company’s current artistic director, Tamara Rojo, revived this once ubiquitous work as the conclusion of an even-handed, intelligent and engrossing programme.

They are also often accompanied by media blitzes, in which actors don their characters’ clothes over and over for photoshoots and fan meet-and-greets. “If you want to get on to the cover of TV Week, one of the best ways to do that is to have a happy couple in wedding finery,” Andrew Mercado, an Australian film historian, says.Weddings are cathartic for viewers – and a classic exit strategy. They act as a way to give beloved characters a happy ending before they ride off into the sunset, perhaps to attempt a career in Hollywood. Here’s a by no means exhaustive look at some of the pivotal wedding moments that have defined Australia’s soap opera landscape.Set in a fictional, working-class Sydney neighbourhood, E Street ran from 1989 to 1993. Although its heyday was an ongoing serial killer plot line in 1991 and 1992, it also delivered a peak soap opera moment well after Mr Bad’s ugly exit.Toni, played by future pop star and presenter Toni Pearen, and CJ, a former bad boy played by Adrian Lee, had a difficult path from proposal to marriage. After popping the question, CJ was hit by a car and lost his sight. Then just as Toni, in pink satin, walks down the aisle, a flash of light that would make even a casual VFX fan shudder struck behind CJ’s eyes. As his bride approached he regained his vision. “You’re beautiful” he told her, and really meant it. Magic.This miraculous recovery would be mirrored three years later at the wedding of Shane (Dieter Brummer) and Angel (Melissa George) on Home and Away, which saw a wheelchair-bound Angel regain her strength to hobble down the aisle.While Angel and Shane’s wedding remains a fan favourite, the true heart of Home and Away has always been Sally Fletcher, played by Kate Ritchie, who spent 20 years growing up in the fictional beachside town of Summer Bay.Although it doesn’t quite match The Bold and the Beautiful’s Brooke and Ridge, who’ve shared a whopping 11 wedding ceremonies, Sally put on bridal whites three times in the soap’s history – but only once successfully. She fled her first wedding after a her fiance’s attempts at philandering were revealed mid-ceremony had a happy second wedding, but lost her husband Flynn to cancer jilted her third fiance, Brad, on their wedding day after realising she was not ready to move on from Flynn. Not a bad run for Australia’s sweetheart.While the final broken engagement was used to write actor Chris Sadrinna off the show in 2007, Ritchie’s exit was a different kind of happily ever after. In a multi-episode send-off arc in 2008, Sally departed Summer Bay to travel the world.In a precursor to many of today’s medical dramas, the titular Young Doctors (and nurses) on this long-running Australian soap spent as much time romancing each other as they did saving lives. But the biggest wedding of all – which Mercado suggests may have been one of the most expensive in Australian TV history – was between sexy Spanish doctor Tony and the young nurse Tania, played by Tony Alvarez and Judy McBurney respectively.At the time episodes did not air simultaneously across the country so to coincide with their wedding’s air dates Alvarez and McBurney embarked on a national publicity tour. Channel Nine rented real wedding chapels in every capital city and the actors staged mock weddings for huge groups of fans. Afterwards the pair were flooded with wedding gifts from the public. While memories of the tour linger, the on-screen romance proved less permanent. Alvarez left the show the following year.As the first Australian television show to feature nudity, and a homosexual kiss, Number 96 broke many boundaries. But not all of them were positive. Vivienne Garrett, who portrayed Rose Godolfus, broke her contract with the series after a plot line called for her character to “enjoy” a rape scene. The writers gave Garrett a classic soapy exit – a big wedding ceremony. The publicity surrounding the nuptials was massive. On the same day the wedding scene was filmed, the production company held a mock wedding reception at a hotel in Kings Cross. “I was told all the journos and the media were going to be the guests,” Garrett recalls. Straight after filming, still in costume, the cast were whisked to a reception. There were speeches, a bouquet toss and, as it was a Jewish wedding, even stomped glasses: “I just thought ‘What’s this about?’ We’re blurring the lines of reality!’ ” Because of its controversial subject matter, most children were forbidden from watching Number 96 but in Jewish homes around Australia whole families tuned in to watch the wedding.The public wants what it wants, and sometimes it is up to a soap opera to give it to them – with a side of cute animals. The relationship between vet Vicky and doctor Simon on A Country Practice “was a situation where the nation was kind of involved”, says Mercado. Although the writers were dancing around the golden couple’s pairing, the audience was firm. Reportedly during a telethon which featured actors Penny Cook and Grant Dodwell “someone rang up and said ‘We’ll donate a $1,000 if Vicki and Simon kiss’ ”, Mercado says. Although the wedding ceremony was later pipped by another A Country Practice storyline (Molly’s death from leukaemia in 1984), at the time it was one of the most watched events in Australian television history.There are soap opera weddings, and then there’s Charlene and Scott – arguably one of the biggest moments in Australian television history. The culmination of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan’s on-screen romance remains one of the most-watched soap opera episodes in Australia, and pulled in almost 20m British viewers, making it the third-most-watched show of the year in the UK. It also made the cover of Time Magazine Australia, featured on postage stamps two decades later, and Charlene’s puffy white and peach wedding dress remains immortalised in the collection of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.Although the wedding was rumoured to have been sparked by complaints from conservative viewers, upset that the couple had moved in together and were “living in sin”, Mercado suggests this controversy was a ploy by the writers who always “knew they were already going to marry them off”.Since then Neighbours has managed to recapture a bit of the magic, by reusing the church where Charlene and Scott wed (twice), re-airing footage of the ceremony, and even sending Margot Robbie’s character Donna down the aisle to a cover of Charlene’s wedding song, Suddenly, on the show’s 6,000th episode. Then in 2018 the show featured its first gay wedding after the public had voted “yes” to marriage equality the year before.It may not be a soap, but it’s still worth remembering that one of Australia’s most famous comedies began with a wedding, on a sketch show that lasted only one season. From 1994 to 1995 Magda Szubanski, Jane Turner and Gina Riley chronicled the disastrous lead-up to Kim Day’s wedding in a series of sketches on Big Girl’s Blouse. It took seven years for the trio’s genius creation to begin its second life, but luckily they gave the public far more time to “look at moi” when Kath and Kim returned to screens in 2002."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebf3adb8cb281c8d8fca9fbf038d138bd4a92a4/0_11_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ca90b45f983811f78c9d5cc91452e0d","title":"star trek picard review avenue 5 travels euroland in euroland with ed balls crazy delicious","story":"Jean-Luc Picard returned from retirement in the sophisticated new Star Trek, while there were laughs when Hugh Laurie got lost in spaceStar Trek: Picard (Amazon Prime)Avenue 5 (Sky One)Travels in Euroland With Ed Balls (BBC Two) | iPlayerCrazy Delicious (C4) | All 4It’s life, Jim, but not as we know it. It is now, apparently, “a symbol for fractal neuronic coding. The theory was that Data’s entire code, memories, could be reconstituted from a single positronic neuron.” My, how Gene Roddenberry’s little baby Star Trek is all growed up, as are we, from those first 60s wisps of hope-through-tech for humanity via the groping confusions of unintended consequences in a real-life techno-social world, on to this darker, cleverer, wilder beast.There has surely been in all its iterations, from Eugene’s original to all the Voyagers and Discoveries and the lovely JJ Abrams’s filmic reboots, a challenge for the makers of Star Trek: to stay true to the legions of diehard fans, the most outre elements of whom would possibly be more at home in a locked basement playing with soft cardboard goats (or spreading “amusing” internet memes), and the potential hordes of next-gen folks who just want a damn fine story of staunch antiheroes and weird villains and perhaps a hardscrabble philosophical question or two to take to their beds and sleep on. Also, doing all that while not making the rocks wobble.Star Trek: Picard, the newest incarnation, in which Patrick Stewart returns a couple of remarkably unlined decades later as Jean-Luc Picard, the second most famous Federation cap’n ever (there will only ever be one James T Kirk), is, I have to say, another glory. Sophisticated, thoughtful, frightening: if anything is America’s sharper, adult answer to Doctor Who, it’s this. The opener features a J-L P in retirement in his glorious French vineyard, magicked first light of dawn chasing off the last syllables of the night’s wind and just enough nods to 2434 or whatever to permit a hi-tech world, in rural France or whizzy rocket San Fran, of genial peace, harnessed technology, eco (-nomic and -logical) satisfaction. Yet there are still Romulans (miffed at having their planet blown up), smart semi-human droids (outlawed, since they blew up… er, Romulania?), and Data’s twin daughters (!), the best of whom comes to an awful end, the mimsiest of whom the ageing J-L P just has to go looking for in the multiverse, abandoning (boo) his terroir. I hope I’ve got at least some of this right yet it is generally terrific, and far from the rocks wobbling we get some hugely new cutting-edge effects, and also former Borg drone Seven of Nine, from Voyager, rocket fuel to a thousand teenage fantasies, male and female. Crucially, it is kind and (eventually) optimistic. With much green blood.I possibly shouldn’t have watched it right after Avenue 5. Armando Iannucci has a history of doing this kind of thing – spoofing old genres, but doing it somehow better. The Thick of It beat Yes Minister. And Avenue 5 beats both Mars Attacks! and Galaxy Quest in its sheer oof-per-minute wiggles and giggles. So Hugh Laurie is a rugged beardo cap’n on a tourism starship, and it all goes wrong. With a tiny gravitational shift that sends fat tourists in a yoga class lurching and bumping, to the extent that an eight-week honeymoon tour around the stars turns into a three-year voyage to get home. We are left with tourists in space, for years, and a captain who was only brought in as an actor to feign beardy competence, and no functioning engineers.The corporate, as ever, is the enemy. “I need to know who to blame … and if you’re OK?” It’s star actor-heavy, yet lines such as “They’ve over-ridden the Gorn Hegemony… sterilised it so it’ll be qualitative, might even have saturated this place with antileptons … cheeky fuckers”, delivered as soft asides, utterly win it for me. I hope they never get home.I do miss Ed Balls from politics. His rough good sense, his earnest kindness. Early in his Travels in Euroland he says, after meeting some kindly Dutch bigots, “There’s no doubt the kind of politics I believe in feel under threat at the moment. But if you dismiss everybody who votes for one of these parties as extreme and nasty you’re missing what’s really going on… you have to listen, have to understand why they’re asking for change.” That explained Labour’s bubble-Twitterati loss perfectly. But this series, sold as Ed getting to the heart of the rise of populism in Europe, achieved nothing of the sort. He empathised hugely with the “tradition” of Dutch fishermen, the way-we-were-ness (um… pulse fishing? In 1820?) but this felt like a series desperately in need of a hint of a solid question. Ultimately, the programme makers – and you felt Ed – pretty much gave up, cowed by the hugeness of the unformed question. I wish he’d continued questing. He’s perhaps too kind.Heston Blumenthal has done many fine things, yet a large Heston sin was showing off about, basically, “food that pretends to look like other food”. Now it’s a thing. Worse, it’s a show.Crazy Delicious was neither, though I can see why they went for the title: what I can’t see is why Channel 4 felt the need to branch into another cookery thing when they already have the Big Kahuna, Bake Off, on their own doorstep. But apparently we can’t get enough of brave or troubled or demented contestants sobbing through ovens and meunières and mandolins. Perhaps this will be the week when we hit peak Bake Off spinrip-off.Delicious? No. At one stage there were “strawberry-flavoured chicken wings retch vom”. That’s what it says in my notes anyway. Crazy? They tried, with a hallucinogenic set, somewhere between Willy Wonka and a disastrous mushroom session in the haunted grove behind the halls of residence, a little of which was meant to be an edible garden. Three “food gods” in white Grecian robes – geddit? – sat high above the multicoloured chop-shop below, a confused mix of the Garden of Eden and Arcimboldo’s cheese dreams. There was crazed Swede Niklas Ekstedt: “Heff you put any spices in this? I taste human.” Admittedly, he might have said something else. And “soul food guru” Carla Hall, who said things such as “wow … and the king of flavours pulls it out!”, long back when we were still struggling to remember which contestant was which. And Heston, blinking confusedly from behind those specs, which were increasingly failing to hide his alarm at having signed on.The relentlessly upbeat presenter Jayde Adams told poor Hardeep, one of the contestants, who had struggled to temper his pink chocolate enough to have it drop all cool and nice from a big egg mould and was bereft, close to tears: “The thing you’re going to have to do now, right, is” – and Hardeep’s eyes widened, in hope – “is… problem solve! Be positive!”Such presenters are fond of burbling such things: that’s why the drier Noel and soon-to-be-badly-missed Sandi can work so well while still being encouraging. Jayde’s advice went not one whit towards helping Hardeep get the damned egg out of the mould.Elsewhere, they had to “reinvent” a hot dog. My one-word question consists of three letters and an interrogation mark. It’ll probably be a raging success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f520a513ec58f4945f58dbee24f32776fefa58b7/0_395_5842_3506/master/5842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1c7fb95fb9be80897a07a4873e2326c","title":"bernie sanders surges iowa poll ahead of caucuses","story":"Bernie Sanders has surged ahead of Democratic rivals in Iowa, a new poll released on Saturday suggests, with barely a week to go until the state’s voters head to caucuses to nominate a candidate for November’s presidential election.The Iowa caucuses on 3 February represent the first formal election-year test for the Democratic field seeking to challenge Donald Trump for the White House.Sanders, 78, has been “consolidating support from liberals and benefiting from isions among more moderate presidential candidates who are clustered behind him”, the New York Times article accompanying the poll data claimed.Such fractures were evident in the final Democratic debate before the caucus in Des Moines 11 days ago, when the candidates clashed over healthcare and foreign policy, among other issues.The night was capped by an extraordinary post-debate confrontation in which Warren accused Sanders of calling her a liar on national television and refused to shake his outstretched hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eec3aa7ca885b286100a9e67a5a285643a72f1e/0_0_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffd56c25abe0e60afea49aa9cc74741","title":"some folks were tearful cia waterboarding on trial in guantanamo","story":"Two contractors give evidence of ‘The Preacher’, one of three authorised to carry out torture method, who has still not been identified after 17 years There were three men authorised by the CIA to carry out waterboarding on detainees in America’s “war on terror”. Two of them were contractors who are in Guantánamo Bay this week to give evidence. The third has still not been identified 17 years after the torture was committed.In the courtroom of the military commission, the CIA officer was referred to only by three-digit code NZ7, or simply as “the Preacher” – a nickname he was given because of his peculiar way of terrorising detainees.According to James Mitchell, a psychologist on contract to the CIA who helped draft and apply their “enhanced interrogation techniques”, the Preacher “would at random times put one hand on the forehead of a detainee, raise the other high in the air, and in a deep Southern drawl say things like, ‘Can you feel it, son? Can you feel the spirit moving down my arm, into your body?’”Mitchell gave that chilling description in his memoir, Enhanced Interrogation, and on the witness stand on Thursday, he confirmed the Preacher’s role at the CIA black sites. He was giving evidence at a pre-trial hearing in the case against five defendants charged for the 911 al-Qaida attacks, including the self-styled mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.Mitchell, together with his friend and business partner, Bruce Jessen – who is due to testify next week – have been the public face of the US torture programme for five years, settling out of court in 2017 in a civil suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three prisoners.Almost everyone else involved in the extensive programme, involving a network of black sites around the world, has remained in the shadows. In terms of legality, it is still the dark side of the moon.Defence lawyers at the Guantánamo military commission hearings have asked to examine 52 witnesses. They have so far been permitted to question only two, Mitchell and Jessen.James Connell, representing defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, lost his patience on Thursday when prosecutors objected that he was asking Mitchell about events he had not directly witnessed.“He’s the only witness we’ve got. The government has blocked all the CIA witnesses,” Connell complained.Four days before the current pre-trial hearing, the 40th in eight years of legal skirmishes, the prosecution changed the classification rules, and amended them again on Monday on the evening before the first open session. As a result, some facts that were previously unclassified, in published books for example, were reclassified, sending defence attorneys scrambling to reframe their planned line of questioning.The longer the hearings have continued, the clearer it has become that the Mitchell and Jessen partnership was just a small part of the infrastructure of torture, with its own bureaucracy and personal rivalries. In his testimony, Mitchell railed repeatedly against the “middle management” who he believed was plotting against him.Mitchell became embroiled in a vicious turf war with a rival, the CIA chief of interrogations, for mastery of the “enhanced programme”. Each sought to use their links to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to get the other removed from their post. In that struggle the detainees were used as bargaining counters. The two men had them tortured for training or demonstration purposes.In the courtroom this week, the interrogations chief has been referred to by the code NX2. Mitchell calls him the “new sheriff”, but it has been reported his real name was Charlie Wise, who had honed his craft carrying out interrogations for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s. He apparently died of a heart attack in 2003, just weeks after being dismissed.According to declassified cables and courtroom testimony, Wise set up his own training programme, and took his students to a black site in Afghanistan, codenamed Cobalt, to practise their techniques on Ammar al-Baluchi and other prisoners. During that training, Baluchi was repeatedly slammed against a wall, suffering brain trauma as a result.“Looks like they used your client as a training prop,” Mitchell told Connell. A newly declassified paragraph in a secret CIA inspector general report quotes one of the students as saying the site was used for “on-the-job training”. Trainees had to use each of their techniques on Baluchi and other inmates in order to earn certification.An unsanctioned, improvised waterboard was also set up at the Cobalt site, according to defence lawyers. It does not seem to have been part of the training, but it was used on at least one detainee.The CIA was forced to close down its first main interrogation centre in Thailand in late 2002 when its existence was discovered by the New York Times. The “high value detainees” were transferred by rendition flights to a new site in Poland, codenamed Blue, which was run by Wise.Mitchell visited Blue shortly before Christmas in 2002, and testified he witnessed at least two extreme techniques that had not been approved by the CIA or the justice department. In one, a piece of wooden dowel was put behind the knees of a detainee who was made to kneel and then had his back forced back “until his shoulder blades were touching the floor”.In another, the prisoner’s elbows were strapped together with a strap behind his back and his hands were raised above his head. Fearing the torture would cause permanent injury, Mitchell said he tried to stop it but was told “it was none of my fucking business”.When the contractor declared he wanted to return to the US, Wise told him he was not allowed to leave, Mitchell claimed. Nor could Mitchell contact the outside world as all communications equipment at the site were locked up. For a week he was a prisoner of his rival, he said.Mitchell said he was finally permitted to go home because the tension inside the site began damaging morale. On his return he said he complained to the CIA leadership but to no avail. Wise stayed in his job and Mitchell found he was giving courses at headquarters including the banned techniques more than four months later. The chief of interrogation was only fired that summer.Throughout his testimony this week, Mitchell has portrayed himself as a moderate who stuck to the rules and only used extreme measures when he felt he had no choice.He tried to halt waterboarding of the first major detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in August 2002, arguing that the prisoner was fully cooperating, but his superiors in Langley ordered told him and his team in the original black site in Thailand to “stay the course”.In an effort to win the argument, he said he persuaded the head CIA officer in the country to witness a waterboarding for himself.“I wanted the chief of station to experience what we were experiencing,” Mitchell said. “It didn’t smell pleasant. It smelled like sweat – kinda musky.”He also conceded he and Jessen were beginning to feel a bit exposed. They realised they were the only ones in the interrogation room not wearing a mask, and the torture was being videoed.The station chief turned up to watching Abu Zubaydah being waterboarded, but dressed as a guard, his face coveredWhen his superiors insisted he persevere in Thailand, he told them to send a delegation to witness the simulated drowning.“Buddy – you want it,” Mitchell told them. “Bring your rubber boots and come on down.”When the senior officials flew in, on 17 August, he waterboarded Abu Zubaydah even though he was quite sure the detainee had no actionable intelligence to surrender. It was done purely as a demonstration for the agency VIPs. And he applied the technique to the maximum extent allowed, pouring water on to a cloth on the prisoner’s face for 20 seconds and then a full 40 seconds. According to a CIA cable describing the event, Abu Zubaydah went into spasm.The visitors were stunned. “Some of the folks were tearful,” Mitchell said.“I was tearful, but I cry at dog food commercials,” Mitchell claimed. The psychologist’s eyes did indeed well up on a few occasions during his testimony this week, but the tears came when he was describing what he saw as his personal sacrifices. In contrast, he described waterboarding dispassionately, characterising it as “temporary discomfort”.“Does he care more about dog food commercials than he cares about human beings?” asked Terry Rockefeller, who was watching Mitchell’s testimony this week from the military commission’s public gallery on the other side of a reinforced glass partition.Her sister, Laura, was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Centre. She was an actress who just happened to be working in the twin towers in New York on September 11, 2001, on a day job hosting a business seminar on risk assessment.Terry is a member of a relatives’ group called September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, which is seeking justice for the attacks but opposes the use of the death penalty.“The fact that he can talk about something like waterboarding in such clinical terms ... That’s just crushing to me, because my country did it and because I feel a great loss,” Rockefeller said, pointing out that the use of torture against the defendants has vastly complicated the process of putting them on trial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af045af4dea48470df76623caff7896e27a37e60/0_234_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9be0046a41f69a2e84f3dd59c08b9b62","title":"pete buttigieg iowa rallies is america ready for a gay president","story":"Jerry Pinneke is backing Pete Buttigieg for president despite himself. The retired engineer, who worked in the US, Brazil and the UK, likes the Indiana mayor’s youth, is impressed by his ability to speak eight languages, including Norwegian and Dari, and calls him a natural leader. But he has had to set one issue aside.“I’m a homophobe,” said Pinneke after attending a Buttigieg rally in Ankeny, Iowa, as campaigning in the first vote to select the Democratic presidential candidate heads into the final stretch before the state’s caucus on 3 February. “I get around gay people, that isn’t the world that I grew up in and it bothers me.”Pinneke, 71, said he will vote for the gay military veteran despite his own prejudice, although he flinches at the thought of a President Buttigieg with his husband, Chasten, as First Gentleman.“I grapple with that. But so what? Does it hurt anybody? I haven’t seen it. So why is that an issue for me? Is it because I’m an old son-of-a-gun and I didn’t grow up that way? That’s not a good reason not to vote for him,” he said.But Pinneke is not alone in wondering if others might fail to set their prejudices aside, and whether that makes Buttigieg, a 38-year-old Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar and former US navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, a risky bet as a presidential candidate.The South Bend mayor has blazed an impressive streak into the Democratic primaries as an unknown from a small midwestern city. When campaigning kicked off last year, the mantle of youthful upstart was held by the Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who arrived in Iowa bolstered by nearly snatching Ted Cruz’s seat in the US Senate. But O’Rourke quickly burned out, as voters were turned off by a lack of substance behind the show.In contrast, Buttigieg’s relentless campaigning won over voters, with his upbeat message, military background and, for some, his religious faith. He positioned himself as a more youthful Joe Biden in favour of incremental change in contrast to the more radical platforms of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. His star climbed and so did his poll numbers until, by November, Buttigieg was the frontrunner in Iowa. But since then, he has fallen back, as voters focus on the fraught question of who is the best candidate to beat Trump.A CNN poll last week showed all four of the leading Iowa candidates beating Trump in the general election, but Buttigieg was ahead by the slimmest margin. In Iowa, he remains very much in contention, within a percentage point of Sanders and Warren. But nationally he trails his main rivals badly.Debates about electability have flared up periodically in American history. The political establishment questioned if a Catholic could win the White House when John F Kennedy ran in 1960. Barack Obama’s campaign was accompanied by plenty of speculation as to whether the US was ready for its first black president, a question answered decisively by the voters.This month’s bitter confrontation in a televised debate over what Sanders said to Warren in private about the prospects for a woman to be elected president revived chatter over whether gender is an additional obstacle. Hillary Clinton’s defeat of Donald Trump by nearly 3 million in the popular vote, only to be robbed of the presidency by the vagaries of the electoral college, would say not.The issue hasn’t entirely been laid to rest. Warren has faced questions from women at her rallies about whether her gender will be a disadvantage, with Trump stalking the debate stage.Buttigieg’s sexuality is a more awkward question for some Democrats. They do not want to feed prejudice at a time when the US is more tolerant toward the LGBTQ community than ever. Support for same-sex marriage has flipped from two-to-one against 15 years ago to the reverse today. As attitudes have evolved, institutions have followed, from the scrapping of the prohibition on publicly identifying as LGBTQ in the military to the supreme court’s ruling in favour of marriage equality.But for those calculating who would be the best candidate to get the man they regard as the worst president of modern times out of the White House, there is a nagging fear that Buttigieg’s sexuality could cost him votes if he were the candidate, and let Trump back in.Only half of American voters said they were ready for a gay president, according to a poll for Politico in October. Just a quarter of voters thought their neighbours would support a LGBTQ president – a statistic that feeds into concerns among some Democratic primary voters that, while they personally have no problem with Buttigieg, others might. That in turn makes voters like Janet Jalbert nervous.“I think we would have more trouble right now accepting a gay man and having a First Gentleman in the White House than we would a woman president,” said Jalbert, a post office worker and undecided voter, at a Warren rally. “Between Warren and Buttigieg, I would go with Pete. However, I believe Elizabeth probably has a stronger chance just because of the way the world is right now. Old-school people. And that’s the only thing he has going against him. It’s not his sexuality. It’s people with closed minds.”Jalbert said the concern that Buttigieg’s sexuality might diminish the anti-Trump vote was enough for her to shy away from supporting him.“Now, if he were to become vice president, I think that would be a great way to get him in there. And then people could see what it was all about,” she said.At a Sanders rally the following day, Ashly Moore, an occupational therapist, expressed a similar sentiment. “I like Pete but I do have concerns that he could not be as electable because of who he loves,” she said.Last July, that concern was reinforced by the findings of a focus group of black Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, questioned for the Buttigieg campaign. He does poorly in the south in general but particularly among African Americans.“Being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed uncomfortable even discussing it,” said the report leaked to the State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina.The report said that was not necessarily a red line to voting for him “but their preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center”.One man told the focus group: “I’ll go ahead and say it. I don’t like the fact that he threw out there that he lives with his husband.” A woman described Buttigieg speaking about Chasten as “too much information”.Johnnie Cordero, the chair of the black caucus for South Carolina Democrats, told the New York Times that he met Buttigieg to discuss the issue. “To be honest with you, it’s going to be a problem. I know he knows that because we’ve discussed it,” Cordero said. “My advice to him was, don’t flaunt it.”Still, some supporters of rival candidates do not think it is an issue. At the Warren rally, Dylan Baker said the question of sexuality and electability had come up in family discussions.“My dad’s a Democrat. He’s leaning to Biden but he also really likes Pete Buttigieg and we were talking about this question of electability and I was saying him being gay will not affect people’s voting. He said: ‘Oh, yeah, I forgot he was gay.’” Baker paused and then added: “But maybe that will affect things. We’re never past those sorts of things.”Buttigieg has sought to defuse the issue with some black voters who oppose same-sex marriage on religious grounds by drawing parallels between the struggle for gay rights and the challenges facing other minorities. He has also said that once people get to know him they will get over the fact that he is married to a man, an assertion borne out by the focus-group report, which noted that “after seeing the mayor speak, most voters … seemed to be able to get past his sexual orientation”.Bob Sohm, a Buttigieg supporter at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, agreed with that. “People have their prejudices but it can be done. We’ve never elected a black president until now. It’s got to start somewhere.“I think it’s just people need to be more educated about him and know his policies, and maybe think ‘I can start to consider this guy because maybe he can win’.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4151771.1579973897!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"asti secondary teachers to ballot on strike over two tier pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDetails of the timing of an  ASTI ballot on whether to strike  over the two-tier pay system for teachers are likely to be determined next week. File photograph: Cyril Byrne Second-level teachers who are members of the ASTI are to ballot for strike action over the two-tier pay system in schools.Hundreds of schools are already expected to close on February 4th as members of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) get set to stage a one-day strike on the same issue. The ASTI’s central executive council decided to ballot its 17,000 members for industrial action at a meeting on Saturday in protest at the “unequal pay of teachers who entered the profession since 2010”.Details of the timing of the ASTI ballot are likely to be determined next week. However, if the union secures a mandate for industrial action, this is expected to take place only as part of co-ordinated campaign with at least one other education union. The ASTI will not be taking part in the strike planned by the TUI for February 4th as it will not have concluded a ballot in time. Any action undertaken by ASTI members will take place at a later date. The ASTI said on Saturday that it had taken industrial action, including strike action, over unequal pay in 2016. It said that since then there had been some improvements to the pay of new entrants to teaching. “However, despite ongoing campaigning by the ASTI and the other teacher unions, unequal pay remains,” the union stated. ‘Inferior pay arrangements’ASTI president Deirdre Mac Donald said: “It is unthinkable that in 2020 some teachers have inferior pay arrangements even though they are doing the same work as their colleagues in the next classroom. In taking industrial action in 2016, ASTI members lost pay and were further penalised under FEMPI ( financial emergency) legislation, and are still suffering the consequences. However, their action put unequal pay firmly on the agenda. In addition, the ASTI’s actions led to some gains for lower-paid teachers, but full pay equality remains to be achieved and we intend to achieve it.”At its meeting on Saturday, the ASTI central executive passed a motion which stated: “That the ASTI ballot for industrial action up to and including strike action for equal pay, to be taken in conjunction with one or both of the other teacher unions.”In recent days, the ASTI issued instructions to members including principals and deputies not to provide cover for their striking colleagues during the forthcoming stoppage by TUI members on February 4th. The ASTI told members that they should turn up for work as normal on February 4th on the basis that if they refused to work on the day, they would be deemed to be engaging in unofficial industrial action. The union says ASTI members would be paid even if their school was closed as a result of the TUI strike. Union guidanceCrucially, the union guidance states that “no member of ASTI, including principal teachers, deputy principal teachers andor other post holders may undertake any duties that are normally done by colleagues who are members of TUI”.The union’s instruction to members also stated: “No ASTI member can undertake the supervisionsubstitution duties of an absent TUI colleague on 4th February who will be engaged in industrial action. Redesign of the roster with a view to having ASTI members cover supervision slots normally undertaken by TUI colleagues is not acceptable.”The move means that most secondary schools will shut on health and safety grounds, even if only a small number of teachers are TUI members."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4140800.1579105949!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm brendan rattles the nature depleted north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDark Hedges of Stranocum, Co Antrim by Michael Viney Storm Brendan roared through the old beeches of the Kingsroad, as addicts of Game of Thrones, heedless of punctuation, learned to call the Dark Hedges of Stranocum, Co Antrim. Brendan uprooted yet another casualty of the kind that now threatens that magical avenue. Four years ago Storm Gertrude toppled two of the 200-year-old trees. Their timber was swiftly transfigured into 10 heavy doors, quite masterfully engraved with dragons, direwolves and the odd kraken sigil. Installed in tourist pubs and restaurants and featured on the glossy Thrones website, this was an impressive initiative. A similar spirit, perhaps, helped carry Northern Ireland through the three-year vacancy game of Stormont’s own thrones. At the North’s Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, for example, civil servants decided it was time the province had an environment strategy. “Under normal circumstances,” its website confided, “officials would have taken our policy direction from the minister . . .” Without a political boss, it invited “big ideas” from the public for use when the next one came along.The minister appointed this month from the ranks of the DUP has strong views of his own. Edwin Poots is a Free Presbyterian, creationist and denier of evolution. He concurs with the 17th century Archbishop Ussher of Armagh that the date of creation could be set at 4004 BC.None of this, it must be said, should predispose Poots against the conservation of bioersity, composed of all God’s creatures and an indispensable thread of any environment strategy. In 2010, as then minister for the environment, he introduced a permanent ban on hare coursing, readily endorsed by the Assembly. How Poots feels about badgers is not on record, but his new responsibility for agriculture lands him with the problem of high levels of bovine TB that join Brexit at the head of farmers’ concerns. His department chiefs again took new initiatives on their own. A scientific partnership, announced in 2018, seems bound to lead to some urgent decisions on preemptive badger culling. The spur for developing an environment strategy was publication of the UK’s State of Nature report for 2019. An earlier report, in 2016, showed that Northern Ireland was the most nature-depleted part of the UK, itself one of the most nature-depleted places in the world. After a long decline, the new report shows no let-up in loss of wildlife in the North. Some of its figures are all-Ireland threat estimates. But warnings, for example, on the future of breeding curlews and other waders, speak from a long record of local research. “Most original habitats have gone,” mourns the Ulster Wildlife Trust, “and natural ecosystems are fragmented. One in five of our species face extinction.”Lough NeaghIntensive farming takes up three-quarters of Northern Ireland. Framed often by neat, close-cropped hedges, its cattle, poultry and pig farms generate quite a disproportionate share of UK levels of ammonia, the report shows.The impact was illustrated dramatically at Moninea Bog in the southwest, a raised bog and Special Area of Conservation. Ammonia from a neighbouring farm severely damaged the bog vegetation, bleaching its mosses and killing algae on trees. Measures to reduce ammonia emissions are expected to benefit bioersity “within five to 10 years”.Farming run-off has historically polluted Lough Neagh, the biggest lake in these islands and a special arena for the North’s wildlife. It holds a notable population of pollan, a herring-like freshwater fish left over from the last ice age, and its eels continue to support a precarious traditional industry.The lake in winter also attracts thousands of migrant European waterbirds. But in 2013, researchers at Quercus, the Centre for Bioersity and Conservation Science at Queen’s University, reported a dramatic decline in the wintering duck population. It had fallen from 100,000 to less than 21,000, or 75 per cent over a decade.DredgingSome of the decline could be attributed to climate change, as the lakes feeding waterbirds in northeastern Europe stay ice-free in winter. But the Quercus team drew another conclusion: that the North’s farming environment schemes have reduced the organic run-off that boosted populations of water snails and other invertebrates, the food of wintering ducks.This finds no place in the 2019 State of Nature report, which does note six additional ducks for the region’s threatened red list. Nor does it delve into the long campaign by environmentalists to stop the commercial licensed dredging from Lough Neagh of some 1.5 millions of tonnes of sand a year.And Northern Ireland still has no national park, 18 years after the Mourne Mountains were selected. Resistance from resident farmers has delayed every effort at decision. In 2010 Poots put it off further. “We need to think carefully, and to debate fully,” he said, “what a Northern Ireland National Park should be like.”With farmers, environment and rural affairs in his care, he still has everyone to please."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150511.1579903935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seamus mallon tributes paid from across political spectrum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeamus Mallon and  John Hume at the SDLP 33rd annual conference at the Wellington Park Hotel, Belfast in 2004. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Tributes have been paid from across the political spectrum to Seamus Mallon, the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and deputy leader of the SDLP, who has died age 83.Mr Mallon served as deputy to John Hume for two decades, and was a trenchant critic of both republican violence and discrimination against nationalists.In a statement, Pat and John Hume said that “history will remember Seamus as one of the great Irish patriots and peacemakers.“He was a man of huge strength and courage, who stood with John for many years in the fight for justice, peace and reconciliation on this island.”They said Mr Mallon was “fearless” in condemning violence, and that “his clarity, insight and political nous sustained the SDLP.”President Michael D Higgins said Mr Mallon’s reputation as a “politician and community activist of unsurpassed courage, civility and fairness is held by all those who had the privilege of knowing him.“Few people have influenced the peace process in Northern Ireland more than Seamus Mallon, a formidable opponent and, a tough negotiator in speech and act, but always honest and honourable.”Colum Eastwood, the current SDLP leader, said Mr Mallon was an Irish patriot. “He lived for our country and has left an indelible mark on the lives of everyone who enjoys the peace he helped to forge.”In a joint statement, First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill paid tribute to Mr Mallon.Ms Foster said he was “instrumental in bringing about peace for our people and that contribution should not go unrecognised”. And Ms O’Neill described him as “a significant political figure” whose “mark on our history is indelible”.‘Extraordinary contribution’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted: “History will remember Seamus as an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, a committed peace builder and a tireless champion of an inclusive Ireland.”Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said she was “saddened” to learn of his death and he would be remembered for his contribution to Irish politics over many decades as the SDLP deputy leader and the key role he played in achieving the Good Friday Agreement.”Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin expressed “ deep sadness” at the death of Mallon. “Seamus made an immeasurable contribution to the cause of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland,” he said.British government Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith said Mr Mallon “dedicated his political career to making Northern Ireland a better place”.Mr Mallon served as deputy to first minister David Trimble in the first Northern Ireland Executive in 1999.Lord Trimble said his role in brokering the Belfast Agreement was a “huge” achievement.“Even though from then to now there have been huge ups and downs in the political system, there has been no move away from peace.”Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said Mr Mallon was a key negotiator for the SDLP in the talks leading to the agreement. “Seamus was strong with courage and he had commitment to peace and making progress for Northern Ireland and this whole island.”A statement from former US president Bill Clinton said: “Hillary and I are saddened by the passing of Seamus Mallon, a hero of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a profoundly good man.“A teacher in practice and in heart, the lessons of his life and power of his example are as important today as ever.”Former British prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Mallon was “one of the most important architects of peace in Northern Ireland. Brave, blunt, often prepared to swim against the tide if he felt it right, he was someone deeply respected and admired across the troubled landscape of Irish politics.”‘Likable stubborness’Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Archbiship of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, said the people of Armagh had “lost one of our most respected sons and bravest leaders”.He called for a renewed effort by political leaders to build a shared home place on the island of Ireland as a “fitting tribute to his legacy”.Tom Kelly, a close political ally and former vice-chair of the SDLP who worked as Mr Mallon’s Westminster assistant in the late 1980s and then on most of his elections, said the former deputy first minister had a “transformative” effect on Northern Ireland, complimenting SDLP leader John Hume.“John Hume painted with broad strokes, Seamus Mallon did detail,” Mr Kelly told The .He said Mr Mallon’s relationship with David Trimble was “an odd one, but it worked”. Mr Mallon could be “Thran” – a Northern word meaning stubborn, but it was “ a likable stubborness”.“But his strength was that his instincts chimed with those of the nationalist community, specifically in rural areas when he said something, it was how people felt, they just couldn’t articulate it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150608.1579896541!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 auction politics an added complication for electorate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is more in common with the way Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael allocate funds than there are differences.  Perhaps the crisis has changed Irish election campaigns – at least a bit. The line- up of promise after promise continues, based on a benign economic scenario which may, or may not, emerge.The basis for the two manifestos is the €11 billion in “unallocated resources” that the Department of Finance said would be available in the potential five-year term of the next government. There is more in common with the way the two parties allocate the cash than there are differences – but first the health warnings.If economic growth collapses – for example due to the United Kingdom not striking a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit – then much of this money would not be available. Also, we know from experience that the cost of dealing with inflation and demographic pressures in areas like health in particular is enormous – it costs a lot just to stand still. The parties both allocate cash for this, though the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has warned that existing Department of Finance figures do not allow nearly enough for these pressures.On the flip side – and presumably recognising that prudence is politically popular due to memories of the crash – both parties commit to pay cash into the rainy fund, with Fine Gael promising €500 million a year and Fianna Fáil €750 million. Fine Gael’s figures seem to leave a little more of the €11 billion unspent, so in terms of prudence, at least on paper, there is not a lot between them.Given that real life will almost certainly end up messier than the projections, it comes down to who you trust to make the right decisions and set the right priorities.Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe plays up the fact that he introduced a tight budget for this year, despite cash being available before an election, while Fianna Fáil focuses on the outgoing Government’s overspending in areas like health and on projects like the children’s hospital. Whether that party’s role in the build up to the economic crisis is a factor with voters is hard to tell and will probably only be evident after the election.The other thing that has changed in election campaigns is that promises of big tax cuts are off the table and the vast bulk of extra resources are planned to go to higher spending. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil say they will allocate spare resources on budget day roughly four to one in favour of spending over tax, with Fine Gael producing year-by-year breakdowns of how it would add up.The Fine Gael income-tax package is a bit bigger, centred on a commitment to increase the entry point to the higher rate from €35,300 now to €50,000 and an increase in the Universal Social Charge (USC) exemption threshold from €13,500 to €20,000. Fianna Fáil promises to increase the threshold for entering the higher rate by €3,000 for a single person and cut the USC rate which applies on earnings between about €20,000 and €70,000 from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent.‘Extra funding’We have seen during the term of the outgoing Government how pressure on spending each year has meant very little by way of tax reductions. Also, it would require significant moves of credits and the tax bands each year just to ensure people don’t pay a higher proportion in tax as their wages increases. So the tax burden is not going to fall, whoever leads the next administration.The economics of election 2020 is all about spending. The debate about who can deliver and how much it will cost will rage in the days ahead. On health, Fine Gael’s headline commitment is to allocate €5 billion extra. This comprises about €3.2 billion in what the party terms “extra funding”, with the rest accounted for by allocations to allow for demographic pressures and the impact on health of any new pay agreement. Fianna Fáil promises €2 billion additional in health and also says it has allowed for demographic and pay pressures. Improving the system and implementing the Sláintecare plan is a massive challenge. The same complex job of implementation awaits in housing.The Green Party and Sinn Féin manifestos will present alternative strategies. The two big parties are promising more of the same by way of much higher spending in key problem areas, only with both claiming they can achieve better outcomes. Voters will look at what differences there are on spending and tax – and there are some. But if they are choosing between the two big parties, the key decision is who they believe will deliver more efficiently, or be able to steer the economy if trouble does hit.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4151718.1579961537!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens want 2 5bn a year spent on retrofitting houses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party candidate Cllr Neasa Hourigan alongside party leader Eamon Ryan during the publication of the party’s manifes  in Dublin on Saturday. Photograph: PA   The State needs to increase spending on home insulation to at least €2.5 billion a year if it is to meet targets to cut emissions, according to the Green Party.Publishing their manifesto in Dublin on Saturday, the Greens claimed it was the only party capable of playing “senior hurling” on climate change.Its manifesto calls for a 7 per cent per year fall in emissions to reach the EU CO2 reduction target of a minimum 50 per cent by 2030.The Greens also want net zero emissions in Ireland by 2040, some ten years ahead of most other parties.Their manifesto does not give specific numbers for targets for housing, on tax measures and health spending (although it agreed that €5 billion in additional spending would be needed for Sláintecare over five years).It refused to do so because it said it did not want to get involved in a meaningless “auction” on promises.Party leader Eamon Ryan said if Ireland was to reach its emissions reduction goals it will need to spend a total of €50 billion over 20 years to retrofit 750,000 houses to improve energy efficiency.The Green Party said the State did not currently have the resources to retrofit homes at scale.As a first step the party is proposing allocating of €210 million per annum for retrofitting, and a budget of €40 million to train 20,000 workers who can specialise in this area.ManifestoMr Ryan said the party would increase funding for this once enough people had been trained.The manifesto was launched by Mr Ryan, by deputy leader Catherine Martin, Senator Pippa Hackett and Cllr Neasa Hourigan in the Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin.The party has called for the investment in public transport to be doubled and it wants 20 per per cent of all transport funds ring-fenced for cycling and walking. It also proposes that all students in the State be entitled to free public transport, at a cost of €60 million per annum.It has also set an ambitious target of 5GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2040 of energy to come from offshore wind energy, generated on floating turbines in the Atlantic and Celtic Seas.The Green Party has also set a target of 700,000 solar panels on Irish homes as well as 50,000 on commercial premises. It has called for an immediate nationwide ban on smokey coal.On education, Ms Martin said the party wanted the pupil-teacher ration to drop from the current 25 to 1, to 20 to 1 over the lifetime of the next government.The manifesto also calls for social houses to be built on public land but, unlike other manifestos, the party has not specified how many, saying it would refuse to enter the “numbers auctions” of other parties.The Green manifesto also proposes ending oil and gas exploration, ban peat extraction, as well as rewetting 20 per cent of agricultural land.The manifesto does not contain much detail on cost, with Ms Hourigan saying the costs are similar to the ones in its pre-budgetary submission.Transport policiesAsked if its transport policies would mean some of the 60 road proposed projects would be mothballed, Mr Ryan replied his party could not stop everything. But he pointed out that not one cycling or walking project was being progressed at the moment.The Green party is not proposing tax cuts. Mr Ryan said the party’s priorities were climate change, housing, health and transport.“There is no point in giving tax cuts and then having people stuck in traffic for two and a half hours,” he said.The manifesto returned to a favourite Green theme of a basic income, which has been in its manifestos for over 30 years.“The idea is that nobody will be left behind, that everyone should have a basic income... We feel it will require a new Green Deal to achieve,” said Ms Hourigan.Mr Ryan said the main difference between his party and the others was on its approach to responding to climate change.He said that the big parties had showed a lack of ambition. Mr Ryan said there was nothing in the manifestos of the other parties to show how Ireland could reach its emissions targets.The party’s policies as they affect rural Ireland has been seen as a soft underbelly, confining its support to urban areas.Mr Ryan and Ms Hackett both rejected the argument that the Greens were against rural Ireland.“The fallacy of ’this will not be good for rural Ireland’ will have to stop,” he said.Ms Hackett said: “We have the money from the CAP budget. The model of farming (will need to) be shifted around. It will always be about producing food but we can produce better food, hand-in-hand with farmers doing bioersity, supporting habitats and rewetting lands.”Mr Ryan also paraphrased a comment made by a Fianna Fáil minister to the Greens when they first entered government 13 years ago to the effect they were now playing “senior hurling”.“We are the only party able to play senior hurling when it comes to climate change,” Mr Ryan asserted.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150397.1579904878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"men like seamus mallon don t come along too often","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeamus Mallon was an architect of the Northern Ireland peace process and a key figure in negotiating the 1998 Belfast Agreement.

He was diagnosed with cancer late last year and, according to Ms Rodgers who last visited him on Christmas Eve, was prepared and reconciled for what was to come.And recalling their days from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, through to the foundation of the party and failed Sunningdale powersharing executive of 1974, to the heady days of the 1998 Belfast Agreement and, finally, the powersharing institutions just restored, Ms Rodgers characterised Mr Mallon as a politician with a “fixed moral compass”.She recalled also how he was assailed from many sides, including facing death threats, for the principled stances he took throughout his political life.‘A force of nature’Mr Eastwood said he joined the SDLP “because of people like Seamus Mallon”, describing him as “a force of nature”.Mr Mallon was a former teacher. He served as MP for Newry and Armagh and also as Assembly member for the same constituency. From 1979 he was deputy leader of the SDLP with John Hume as leader, both men viewed as pivotal in achieving the peace. The two had occasional differences but were respectful of each other.With John Hume quite ill it was last night left to his wife, Pat Hume, to pay tribute. “History will remember Seamus as one of the great Irish patriots and peacemakers,” she said.And she added: “Men like Seamus Mallon don’t come along too often.”Mr Mallon is predeceased by his wife Gertrude and is survived by his daughter Orla, son-in-law Mark and granddaughter Lara."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4150603.1579896187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what are the differences between ff and fg election promises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPostering in Dublin city centre  Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Tax cuts versus spending increasesBoth parties say they will split future spending on a four to one ratio in favour of spending increases over tax cuts.TaxFine Gael wants to increase the threshold at which people hit the higher rate of income tax from €35,300 to €50,000, which it says will be worth €3,000 to the average earner if the policy is fully implemented.

The tax free allowance for inheritance tax will remain at €335,000 for inheriting sons and daughters.

Capital gains tax would be cut from 33 per cent to 25 per cent.HousingFine Gael wants to provide between 35,000 and 40,000 homes per year and add 60,000 social houses over the next five years. It also proposes expanding the Help to Buy scheme, which currently provides an income tax and Dirt refund of €20,000 for first time buyers to be used for a deposit on new or self build homes. People living in towns with populations of less than 2,000 would be offered State owned sites at cost, which Fine Gael says would provide 8,600 homes.Fianna Fáil says it can increase housing supply to 200,000, including 50,000 new social and 50,000 new affordable homes. The party would introduce an SSIA style scheme for first time buyers, which would see the State top up the savings of first time buyers by 33 per cent to a limit of €10,000. It would apply to the purchase of new and second hand homes up the value of €500,000. The Help to Buy scheme would remain in place and the tax refund would increase from €20,000 to €25,000.HealthFine Gael says it would spend an extra €5 billion per year on health over the next five years.

Daily hospital car parking charges would be capped at €10.Free GP care would be extended to everyone under the age of 18, the income limits for medical and GP visit cards would rise, and the threshold for medical cards for the over 70s will go back to 2012 levels.Fianna Fáil in power would allocate an extra €2 billion to the health sector and claims that Fine Gael’s €5 billion promise includes pre-existing commitments. Fianna Fáil wants an extra 2,600 hospital beds to reduce emergency department waiting times to four hours double funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund to €200 million recruit 1,000 extra consultants and 4,000 extra nurses expand free GP care increase home care hours by five million over a term of office increase funding to the Fair Deal scheme by €225million.Climate changeFine Gael says it would increase the retrofitting of homes by ten times current levels increase the take up of electric vehicles from 50 times current levels and consider a car scrappage scheme for the next budget plant an additional 440 million trees. Carbon tax would rise to €80 per tonne by 2030 with €6 billion of carbon tax revenues reinvested in climate measures. The party wants to invest €21.8 billion in climate projects through the capital investment plan. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2030. There will also be new or increased levies on plastics and coffee cups.Carbon tax would be increased to €80 per tonne by Fianna Fáil and a new national infrastructure commission would be established to examine “30 year decarbonisation planning”. This commission would “oversee the long term plans for: decarbonising Ireland a strong public transport network that balances the economic needs of the country and the development of the rural regions”. A national retrofit scheme would also be rolled out diesel cars would be banned from cities from 2030,with a “complete removal” of fossil fuel cars from 2035.Education and ChildcareFine Gael says it will further decrease the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools from its current rate of 26:1, but does not set out a specific target. It says it will gradually increase funding for higher education, which will reach €100 million above existing levels by 2025. On childcare, the universal childcare subsidy will be increased from €20 per week to €100 per week by 2025.Fianna Fáil aims to reduce the pupil teach ratio to 20:1 by 2025 and would provide an extra €100 million per year to higher education. On childcare, the universal childcare subsidy will be increased from €20 per week to €80 per week by 2025.PensionsFine Gael would increase the weekly State pension by €5 per year. It would continue with the rise in the State pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. However, a new transition pension, equal to the State pension, for those over 66 would be introduced. For those aged 65, they would also receive a payment equal to the dole but they would not have to sign on or be seeking work.Fianna Fáil would increase the weekly State pension by €5 per year and wants to “establish a commission to examine the State pension age, and defer any further pension age increase pending its completion”. In the interim, a transition payment equal to the State pension will also be paid to those aged 65 and 66.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149978.1579857872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit european presidents sign withdrawal agreement","story":"There was mixed emotions among British MEPs as they cleared their offices in Brussels.

China must spend this New Year holiday racing to detect and contain a new respiratory disease, the Wuhan coronavirus, which has killed at least 26 people and scientists think has spread to several thousand.There is good news. The virus is not as deadly as SARS. In fact, it is only about 10 times as deadly as seasonal flu, meaning 98 per cent of people who get it will survive (versus 85 per cent for SARS). While this isn’t exactly wonderful, it isn’t apocalyptic either. Crucially, however, China is managing the Wuhan virus very differently from how it managed SARS in 2003.According to Peter Kellam, a virus professor at Imperial College, the most important factor in managing a pandemic is “sharing”. This is hardly an area in which Chinese authorities have traditionally excelled, but for scientific purposes, both China and international institutions appear to have learned from Beijing’s disastrous attempt to cover up SARS. Scientists across the world have been given access to data like confirmed infection rates and the virus’s genome, allowing the system to gear up quickly, developing diagnostic tests and researching potential drugs. An inspection team from the World Health Organisation visited Wuhan this week and “commended” Chinese authorities for their handling of the crisis.As so often in China, however, the boundaries of freedom are strictly drawn. Official state media outlets have kept reporting low-key, placing news of the outbreak below reports of Xi Jinping’s latest marvellous speech. For now, non-state media have had their leash loosened, but they are ever-alert as to when it shortens again. Whether it is air pollution, anti-foreign rage or product contaminations, the pattern is the same. Periods of relative openness are followed by crackdowns before the debate gets “out of hand”.In some ways, a totalitarian regime might be seen as uniquely well-suited for handling a pandemic. Quarantining a zone of some 30 million people, as China is attempting around Wuhan, has never been done elsewhere. Beijing’s desire to build a surveillance network capable of tracking every single inidual always and everywhere sounds like it might be useful in tracing infection. And Westerners are dumbfounded to hear that the city’s authorities are erecting a new hospital within a week.Human adaptation to threat is not quite so straightforward, however. The desire for total control, and the illusion of having it, can be just as dangerous as it is efficient. On Monday, President Xi issued an edict commanding officials to put “safety and health” before all other objectives. Unfortunately, when you have built a political culture on lies and censorship, it is difficult to change the habits of a lifetime by decree.There are multiple reports suggesting that Wuhan city authorities leaned heavily on local media and hospitals to stop news of a new virus from spreading in the initial stages, and information is still being tightly controlled. Scientists abroad may well have been inspecting its genome well before locals were given any comprehensive information about the disease.From here, it might seem inconceivable to think that a government can control the spread of domestic news about a major disease outbreak involving a 30-million person quarantine during the busiest travel time of the year. But Beijing is experienced in such matters. In 2008, authorities permitted a cover-up that led to 300,000 babies being poisoned by contaminated milk formula in order to avoid embarrassment ahead of hosting the Olympics. And across the country, the real 20-40 million person death toll of Mao’s great famine, just two generations ago, is still not widely known.Where cover-ups become tricky is when they hit international scrutiny. It was New Zealand that blew the whistle on the poisoned formula scandal, just as it was the international backlash that made the suppression of SARS impossible and therefore highly politically damaging to the Communist Party. Clearly, the party has learned this lesson when it comes to managing disease.Quick spread of CoronavirusDomestically, however, Chinese citizens know full well that they rarely get the full story from their media or government. It might not directly affect medical collaboration abroad, but it undermines the trust needed to manage public responses during a crisis like a pandemic. If the government tells its citizens not to travel, to report suspicious symptoms or to take protective measures, for example, its advice is more likely to be heeded if it does not have a longstanding habit of lying. And in a really deadly epidemic, living under a government that views its people’s lives as disposable could rather change the calculus over whether to go and get tested for a suspected infection.More broadly, it is difficult to change ingrained habits in a system riddled with corruption and distrust. New diseases like the Wuhan virus, as well as bird and swine flu, are known to be especially liable to emerge from food systems in which live, wild game mixes freely with concentrated populations, cooking and slaughtering. Officially, trade in wild animals, from delicious-sounding wild duck to the rather less appealing civet cats and pangolins, is strictly controlled in China.In practice, undercover reporters find live specimens of the poor creatures on sale all over the place, like the market from which the Wuhan virus is thought to have originated. I’ve seen such a sight myself in a Chinese market, though it was about seven years ago: rows of sorry-looking, panting animals in cages or live insects being snapped in half right next to raw meat being prepped for cooking.For now, Chinese media are being given relatively free rein to report on the problem. But how long will it be before they investigate too far up the chain and cross the wrong person – some senior official with an interest in the trade, for example – and the window of freedom closes?Clearly, China’s management of disease has improved enormously in the last 15 years and we are all safer for it. But openness to science has not translated into openness for ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, this capricious boundary means that a society that produced outbreaks like SARS, H7N9 and a live swine flu epidemic that is even now devastating the country’s pork industry still cannot openly debate the question: “How does this keep happening to us?”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The crisis of confidence at the BBC – and make no mistake, it is a full blown, all alarm bells ringing, catastrophic crisis – is probably the most visible sign of the shift but it is much bigger than this.So bear with me: I promise that the whole column is not going to be about the BBC, even though it is easily the most infuriating and useful exemplar of the problem.But no, what could be about to implode is not just the sublime, unlimited self-regard of the broadcasters. It is nothing less than the whole interlocking set of preconceptions that are so embedded in the consciousness of those who decide what it is acceptable to think that they must ignore or traduce anything that contradicts them.Of course, self-doubt should have begun with the Brexit referendum result but that scarcely slowed them down: if a majority of the country were benighted bigots then it was up to the enlightened ones to lead them out of the darkness. Or to bully them out of it. And believe it or not, a good many of the Enlightened actually believed they had succeeded in this – hence the demand for a second referendum which would allow the masses to repent of their ignorance.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThen came the general election which was, in effect, a second referendum. And that was the end. You could hear the sound of an edifice falling to the ground and smashing into pieces as you watched the television coverage of this cataclysm. It was such a resounding and utterly unexpected repudiation not just of the mindset of the BBC but of virtually all of the broadcast media – and the cultural circles in which their denizens travel – that it will probably be a generation before they recover. If they ever recover.Indeed, we must hope that the vainglorious arrogance never does return. What we want is not another set of sacred tenets which can be enforced with monolithic certainty, but humility: a genuinely liberal regard for differing opinions. But you know all this. Everybody knows it – except apparently the broadcast executives who are now running around in crazy circles like ants whose nest has been demolished.Presumably this sense of mission to enforce a moral doctrine and prescribe its rules to a grateful nation emerged from the post-war period when rationing and rebuilding dominated the country’s priorities. The most charitable interpretation of this phenomenon is that it began as a belief that it was the duty owed by the educated classes to British working people who had endured terrible deprivations and danger.If you listen to the patronising tone of the many public information pronouncements of the time, this is what you hear: we are going to create a new future with better housing, a fairer distribution of resources, state-run services and comprehensive health and welfare provision. You must trust our judgment in all things: we know better than you what is needed. Which is pretty much exactly the tone that the political descendants of those public policy managers adopt today, only now they are talking about climate change, multiculturalism, economic globalisation and gender identity.Arguably, a good many of the solutions that the Enlightened Benefactors imposed on society even in that earlier incarnation were wrong-headed or dangerously skewed by the political fashions of the time. Were vast council estates really a social improvement on the old Victorian terraces which might have been renovated rather than demolished? Were rationing and the nationalising of public services actually ways of ensuring fairness, or just a handicap to economic recovery?Lord Hall\u0026#039s message to all BBC staffBut at least back then it was plausible to claim that most people in the country bought into those beliefs. The trauma of the war had created a genuine sense of national unanimity. There had probably never been such widespread agreement on priorities and so much willingness to make sacrifices for the general good. If the specific programmes were questionable, they would be challenged only by a small and rather unpopular minority of sceptics.Needless to say, that is not the case with the doctrines being enforced by the great unidentifiable Authority now. Even if you accept that climate change is a fact, you might want to see less shrill alarmism and more attention paid to possible solutions that do not involve pauperising the developing world. (The BBC recently put Sir David Attenborough’s announcement of imminent climate crisis at the top of its main news bulletins. With great respect to the saintly Sir David, something that he says is not the most important news story of any day.)You may welcome migrants of all colours and backgrounds, and have limitless compassion for the disabled, without wishing to see classic literary texts re-written and programme presentation rotas designed to ensure their visibility. You may sympathise with the problems of sexual minorities but be disturbed by the proportion of attention that is devoted to their demands. In other words, you may be angry and frustrated by the implicit assumption that you and your reservations are beyond the pale.I am sure it is not an accident that adversaries of the official enlightened wisdom are only invited to participate in broadcast debate under the most loaded and disadvantaged circumstances, to be set against a solid phalanx of the upholders of Virtue – which is why so many of us have given up trying. It is really rather difficult to argue with people who think you don’t have a right to exist (quite literally, in the case of Israel).But the truth has finally hit. To adapt a notorious Corbynism, we are the many and they are the few, and it is time we were given our proper place in respectable conversation.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

If you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.Previous advice by the FCO said that all but essential travel to Wuhan should be avoided, followed by a warning hours later to avoid all travel to Wuhan City.Any attempts to evacuate British citizens are likely to be hampered by the Chinese authorities\u0027 restrictions on movements in and out of Wuhan. There are no plans for the UK to pull its diplomats out of the region, despite the growing death toll and a decision by the US to fly home consular staff and their families.As many as 500 French citizens in the city, meanwhile, will be offered a coach service by the consulate general of France in Wuhan to take them to safety.The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is now facing a growing backlash over its response to the crisis, with several British professionals based in Wuhan claiming they had been offered no help.Simon Gibbons, a 36-year-old from London who works in the automotive industry in Wuhan, told the : “We haven’t had any official notice from the British government - the French and American Embassies seem to be doing everything they can in light of the situation to provide their citizens with every opportunity to leave the city.“Yet again we see that the approach favoured by the FCO is sitting back and watching the situation develop before they put any plans in place - when 300 brits in Wuhan are scared to leave the house.”Joe Armitt, a 30-year-old English teacher originally from Northampton, added: “It seems like the French and the American embassies are going to great lengths to ensure their citizens have a safe repatriation plan.“For the Brits, we’ve seen no real attempt form the British Embassy or Foreign Office to reach out and offer us support.”Thirty-one people have been tested for the virus in the UK, including 17 in the space of 24 hours, but no cases have yet been identified. On Saturday night the death toll in China was reported to be 56, with 13 new fatalities and hundreds of new confirmed cases.This puts the nationwide total of confirmed infections at 1,975. Canada last night confirmed its first case.Passengers arrive at Heathrow Airport from Gengzhou, ChinaFears are mounting that coronavirus could spread before symptoms begin to show in patients, as British researchers said a vaccine breakthrough could be just weeks away. Travellers who have returned to the UK from Wuhan, China, have been advised to remain inside if they feel unwell after Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, warned the spread of the deadly illness was “accelerating”. There have yet to be any confirmed cases in the UK, which is one of the first countries to have a specific test for the disease outside China, but its arrival is feared to be inevitable. British authorities hope to head off a potential public health crisis by asking those who are concerned they may be infected to book a phone consultation with their GP, rather than visit the surgery.However, research has now suggested the infection can be passed between people without them realising, after genetic analysis was conducted on the newly discovered illness.Scientists concluded it “appears possible” the virus can be spread before the carrier notices any symptoms, meaning an outbreak in the UK may prove challenging to contain. It came after six family members who arrived at a hospital in Hong Kong with unexplained pneumonia - which coronavirus can bring about - had their medical tests analysed in research published by The Lancet. A separate study found that sustained human-to-human spread was the only plausible explanation for the scale of the outbreak. Previously, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization insisted that the majority of cases had jumped into humans from animals. But the first modelling study to examine disease transmission found that each infected person passed it on to an average of 2.6 others. This raises the possibility that an outbreak will only be controlled if onward transmission is blocked in well over 60 per cent of cases.We need to plan for the possibility containment of this epidemic isn’t possible, said Neil Ferguson, a disease outbreak scientist at Imperial College London who led the research.Professor Robin Shattock, from Imperial College London, said his team had “two vaccine candidates” developed from the genetic sequence of coronavirus provided by Chinese scientists. He told Radio 4’s Today programme the vaccines would be ready for use in “animal models” by the middle of next month and they were ready to “rapidly move those into human studies” if required. Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have flown back to the UK from Wuhan - with airlines and the Border Force now helping the Government to contact passengers. It is unclear how many have been located since returning from the region in the past two weeks.An update from the Government, published on Saturday, warned coronavirus is believed to be particularly dangerous for older people or those with weakened immune systems or long-term illnesses.It added: “If you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever, difficulty breathing or a cough within 14 days, you should seek medical attention either in China or on your return to the UK. “In the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.”Pandemics and epidemicsComment: Dread threats from the EU will not stop us from returning power to the British peopleAfrica threatened with severe food crisis as locust \u0026#39mega-swarms\u0026#39 devour crops Time for church to own up to past and present racism, say clergyGardens will look completely different in 20 years time as pests are out of control, Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenter warns Comment: Why exactly should we cheer Sinn Fein’s return to office in Northern Ireland?Boeing 777X, the world’s largest twin-engine jet, completes first flightCoronavirus: Baby born to \u0026#39infected\u0026#39 mother as backlash grows against local Wuhan officialsUS evacuates consular staff from Wuhan as coronavirus outbreak \u0026#39accelerates\u0026#39Brexit celebrations rub Remainers\u0026#39 noses in it, says Michael HeseltineGrenfell inquiry panellist steps down over link to cladding firmBarack Obama called Donald Trump a \u0026#39fascist\u0026#39, new documentary about Hillary Clinton claimsCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Coronavirus: How China\u0026#39s increasing global power could be influencing global virus responseCoronavirus: Fears rise of Chinese cover-up as 56 million in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmedSchools to receive Government cash to keep sports halls open in holidays to fight child obesityMurder investigation launched after Matlock Town footballer died in hospital following assaultAdvertising campaign will declare Brexit Britain \u0026#39ready to trade\u0026#39 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177366592_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imw","title":"job share vacant since harry meghan left","story":"Princess Eugenie, pictured with Jack Brooksbank, is back on InstagramWorkers of Britain, keep, erm, working – figures released this week revealed that employment is now at a joint all-time high. A record number of women working full-time (you’re welcome) were partly responsible for this boon, though a 0.2 per cent drop in job vacancies was also recorded. The latter of which seems surprising, given the number of high profile gigs up for grabs at the moment. Such as:Prince Harry’s arrival in his new home of Canada on Monday confirmed the Sussexes’ departure from the British bosom and thus an opening for a new royal “it” couple. Which Princess Eugenie seems very keen to fill, ending her months-long Instagram hiatus by posting a picture of herself and husband Jack Brooksbank in Buckingham Palace on Thursday.The tenth in line to the throne had been keeping a low profile following allegations surrounding her father, the Duke of York, that served up the unlikely double whammy of sullying both the monarchy and Pizza Express Woking. But the Harry and Meghan-shaped hole proved too golden an opportunity to pass up, with Eugenie’s return to social media a pertinent reminder that a young couple willing to live in their grandma’s palace in exchange for the odd flash of public engagement is always close at hand.Top contenders in the “you had one job” stakes are the Gloucester Marathon marshals who, in fairness, did marshal runners along the course – just in the wrong direction. This led to 15 participants in Sunday’s race being wrongly placed – including the winner – and one entrant being disqualified which, though not identifiably down to the marshals, was probably somehow their fault too.The race organisers intend to sue the (unnamed) marshalling firm for an approach that seemed to consist mostly of pointing and hoping for the best, while participants have shared their relief that “justice has prevailed.” It’s certainly put the 2020 Gloucester Cheese Rolling competition on the map.

Was it all a set-up to facilitate his attempts on W1A? Stranger things have happened – not least his wardrobe choices a few days hence of two scarves, one jumper sleeve rolled up to the elbow and a miniature American football in hand. Cummings-era dress down Fridays at New Broadcasting House would be interesting, if nothing else.Sandi Toksvig is stepping down as the host of the Great British Bake Off, a programme in which amateur cooks fondle bread in a tent set to a running commentary of cake-themed pre-watershed smut. Laughing at the words “soggy bottom” for the eight zillionth time appears to have finally lost its allure for Toksvig, who has co-presented the programme since it moved to Channel 4 in 2017. Guesses as to who will replace her have abounded since: will it be Mel and Sue, Bake Off’s original hosts? Meghan Markle, now she’s able to pursue acting work again? Prince Andrew, given the impression that dough-based encounter in Woking more than two decades ago apparently made? Stay tuned.Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier gave his final catwalk show in Paris this week, bowing out after five decades of couture creations including “man skirts”, “granny hair” and Madonna’s 1990 cone bra. Having released an ‘80s dance tune, fronted late-night show Eurotrash (which also starred Carla Bruni and Melinda Messenger) and become a leading voice in the fight for men to take up wearing kilts, Gaultier’s departure from fashion will be keenly felt.Gigi Hadid walks the runway during the Jean-Paul Gaultier Haute Couture SpringSummer 2020 showThough given the advent of eco-pressures on designers, perhaps his exit is well timed – nobody wants a recyclable cardboard cone-boob catastrophe on their hands.Girlfriend for Laurence FoxBeing born into an acting dynasty must be awfully dull. This is surely why Laurence Fox has turned his hand to releasing albums (yes, multiple) bemoaning his orce, as well as appearing on Question Time to decry the censorious Britain in which we now live. One can hardly say anything these days, Fox protested, though he managed to squeeze in accusing a member of the audience of racism, criticising a film for featuring a Sikh actor as a WWI soldier and revealing he once ended a relationship because his other half was too “woke”. Won’t someone free Fox from the shackles of our authoritarian state?After the election bloodbath, Jeremy Corbyn called for a “period of reflection”. Helpfully for absolutely everybody except Labour, that period appeared to have either never begun or ended as soon as Rebecca Long Bailey entered the race to become leader – and was tipped to win.Read more | Labour leadership raceThat fanfare has since subsided, mercifully, with several unions giving their backing to candidates less confused as to whether their surnames contain a hyphen.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels.

Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The bank also hinted that it may relax\u0026nbspits focus on tackling high inflation as it deals with a combination of slowing productivity and an ageing population, as well as the legacy of the financial crisis.“As our economies are undergoing profound changes, it is the time for a strategy review to ensure we deliver on our mandate in the best interest of Europeans,\u0026nbspECB president Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.Interest rates in the eurozone have been close to zero for the past four years as inflation has stayed below the ECB’s 2 per cent target for almost all of the last nine years. Savers in countries such as Germany have grown angry at near-zero savings rates.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said that for the first 10 years of the ECB’s life its goal was to fight high levels of inflation. “The financial crisis was the pivotal point at which eventually inflation was too low, so it’s been a reversal of the situation. It requires that we look at the strategy very carefully and how effective we can be.”The process is expected to conclude by the end of 2020 and Lagarde declined to say if any decisions had been taken. “I would not include, exclude or anticipate how we are going to deliver it,” she said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

But she added the bank would always be governed by its mandate to achieve price stability.The idea that the ECB will adjust its policy to help fight climate change has been at the top of the agenda since Lagarde was appointed president late last year.\u0026nbspShe acknowledged that the debate over the ECB’s role would be controversial and spark criticism. “Is there going to be mandate creep? Isn’t that going to be a distraction? Why should it be the role of central banks?” she gave as examples.She insisted the greater danger was to do nothing. “Failing to try is already failing,” she said, adding that the ECB should consider every area where it could participate in an agenda shared by the European Commission and many eurozone leaders.She insisted that the review would be open to alternative views from within the ECB’s governing council. “I’m not a despotic president of the governing council — all views are welcome,” she said.Earlier the bank said that decided to keep its interest rates on hold, as had been expected. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively.Lagarde said that rates would stay at their historic inflation level until the bank saw inflation get a level “sufficiently” close to its 2 per cent target.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since the so-called \u0027 fish ball revolution\u0027 riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people\u0027s resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product.

It is patently absurd to compare Takeaway with Amazon when evaluating the outlook for future competition.”The decision to open up a probe came after the CMA said it had “reconsidered its position” more than six months after Takeaway first bid for Just Eat.The competition watchdog said: “Information we now have available to us suggests that Takeaway could have been well-placed to enter the UK market, if the merger hadn’t happened, and compete with Just Eat – so it’s important we open a formal investigation to find out more about this.“Ultimately, our job is to protect UK consumers. Merging businesses can always choose to formally notify a merger to the CMA if they want to avoid the risk that the deal could be called in for investigation at a later stage – and Takeaway chose not to do this.”The CMA said that it could not be specific about the new information it had received. Cat Rock urged the regulator to complete its work quickly so that the deal could be completed.Earlier this month Just Eat shareholders agreed to a £5.9bn all-share offer from Takeaway after a drawn-out battle with rival bidder Prosus.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They needed to cook for two hours on the International Space Station, compared with less than 20 minutes on Earth.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere\u0027s still a lot to look into to figure out really what\u0027s driving that difference, but definitely a cool result, Mary Murphy, a manager for Texas-based Nanoracks, said this week.

Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G Oven.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysThe first cookie — in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) — ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I can\u0027t tell you whether it\u0027s cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesn\u0027t look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325 degrees F (163 degrees C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.That\u0027s the beauty of baking in space, according to former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. It\u0027s offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institution\u0027s National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, can\u0027t be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. What\u0027s in orbit now are essentially food warmers.There\u0027s an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, NASA astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a depressing fact that films directed by previous winners have more chance of being nominated than those directed by newcomers.Because of this, the\u0026nbspbest film in any given year almost never wins the evening’s most coveted prize – in fact, it’s sometimes\u0026nbspnot even\u0026nbspnominated in the first place.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOver the decades, there have been countless glaring omissions\u0026nbsp– films that were nominated but were beaten by far inferior films\u0026nbspand classic films\u0026nbspthat failed to secure a single nomination.As the 2020 Oscars approach – a ceremony that’s fast becoming a two-horse race between a film that actually deserves the top prize (Parasite) and a film that does not (1917) – we’ve run through 20 brilliant films that you would have expected to be a\u0026nbspBest Picture winner, but weren’t.Click through the bellow gallery to see what films made the listCreated with Sketch.Oscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas.

It\u0027s easy to see why Hollywood was temporarily more charmed by The Artist, but it\u0027s clear which film will stand the test of time.It\u0027s almost unthinkable to recall that the Coen brothers\u0027 Inside Llewyn Davis only scored two Oscar nominations in the cinematography and sound mixing categories, respectively. In the ensuing years, the film has been hailed as one of the greatest of the 2010s, meaning that its no-show at the Oscars will go down as one of the Academy\u0027s biggest omissions. Still, it would have had a hard time winning over 12 Years a Slave.For the 2015 Oscars race, you were either team Birdman or team Boyhood. Richard Linklater\u0027s labour of love, shot intermittently over 12 years, ultimately failed to win. If there\u0027s any justice, Andrea Arnold will one day become an Oscar winner, but in a perfect world, she would have already won for American Honey, a drama deserving of Best Picture if there ever was one.Horror rarely gets recognised at the Oscars, but Get Out is the closest the genre had come in years.

It had everything going for it, including a standout festival run and universal acclaim. But then Green Book snatched its trophy away in a late stage awards season twist that still seems too ridiculous to be true.Long revered as one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles\u0027 debut – a film following newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane – was just another nominee back in the day, losing out to How Green Was My Valley. The Searchers may be considered John Ford\u0027s greatest film, but it was not treated as such back in the 1950s. In fact, the western starring John Wayne failed to earn a single nomination. Around the World in 80 Days turned out to be more the Academy\u0027s cup of tea.Not only did Alfred Hitchcock never win an Oscar (save for his memorial award in 1968), but neither did any of his films – one of which is Vertigo, a classic that won Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s once-a-decade greatest films of all time poll in 2012. If it had been nominated, it would have faced stiff competition in the form of eventual winner All About Eve.One of the films that kickstarted the New Hollywood Cinema era, The Graduate may have won director Mike Nichols an Oscar, but it ultimately lost out to Norman Jewison\u0027s In the Heat of the Night.  Stanley Kubrick\u0027s sci-fi classic remains one of the most influential pieces of cinema there is. The Academy didn\u0027t agree. The Academy nominated Kubrick for Best Director and awarded the visual effects in favour of considering 2001 for Best Picture (it didn\u0027t even get nominated). That year\u0027s winner was Oliver!, the musical by Carol Reed.Despite Taxi Driver\u0027s failure to win the main award, its nomination in four categories showed the Academy had good intentions. That All the President\u0027s Men and Network also lost out to eventual winner Rocky shows that, ultimately, it never really stood a chance.Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s ambitious Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now received a grand total of eight nominations, but only went home with two prizes (for cinematography and sound) losing out to drama Kramer vs. Kramer.Of all the Oscar blows dealt to Martin Scorsese over the decades, none landed harder than Raging Bull losing out to Robert Redford\u0027s weepie Ordinary People, an oversight many consider one of the Academy\u0027s most egregious.  Another sci-fi classic overlooked by the Oscars was Blade Runner, which didn\u0027t even get nominated in the Best Picture category (Gandhi ended up winning). Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian went on to receive seven nominations in 2017 – evidence, perhaps, of the Academy taking responsibility for its past errors.1023 Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee\u0027s Do the Right Thing failing to win Best Picture at the 1990 Oscars is one thing – losing out to Driving Miss Daisy is another thing altogether.   Having awarded both The Godfather Part I and The Godfather Part II Best Picture in 1972 and 1974 respectively, the Academy seemed destined to appreciate Martin Scorsese\u0027s Goodfellas. But no – Kevin Costner\u0027s directorial debut Dances with Wolves was the most appealing choice for voters.New talent on the block Quentin Tarantino\u0027s second feature Pulp Fiction won him the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at Cannes in 1994 – a success he failed to match back on home turf.

The scientists hope to have a pilot factory producing the batteries within five years at the Berkeley site.The ultimate aim is to have a factory based at one of the former power stations in the South West that takes Carbon-14 isotopes directly from the graphite blocks for use in diamond batteries. This would significantly reduce the radioactivity of the remaining material, making it easier and safer to manage,” said Professor Tom Scott, director of the South West Nuclear Hub.With the majority of the UK’s nuclear power plants set to go offline in the next 10-15 years this presents a huge opportunity to recycle a large amount of material to generate power for so many great uses.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They shine so intensely that they challenge traditional astrophysical models, which have been unable to account for such a bright star.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow scientists think they have found the cause of the blazing brightness coming out of\u0026nbspSN\u0026nbsp2006gy. And they hope that it could shed light on where other such superluminous supernovae get their intensity from.The new breakthrough came when researchers discovered that the star gained its intense brightness when a normal supernova crashed into a shell of material that surrounded it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

They suggested that vast amounts of iron could account for that particular line, as researchers call it – and when they tested that scenario, it worked.Scientists detect ‘unknown’ burst of gravitational waves in spaceIt became even more exciting when it quickly turned out that very large amounts of iron was needed to make the lines - at least a third of the Sun\u0027s mass - which directly ruled out some old scenarios and instead revealed a new one,\u0026nbspsaid Anders Jerkstrand from the Department of Astronomy at Stockholm University.The researchers suggest that before SN 2006gy\u0026nbspbecame what it is today, there was a double star made up of a white dwarf as big as Earth, and a huge hydrogen-rich massive star the size of our solar system. As the bigger star became even bigger, the smaller one was caught up in it and fell in towards the centre.When it got there, the white dwarf exploded into a Type Ia supernova – a normal supernova.

I mean, really remarkable people.”Asked about any future royal visits, a spokeswoman for Prince Charles said: “There are no plans for The Prince of Wales to undertake an official visit to Iran.”Prince Charles’s wish to visit Iran comes at a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and the West.A stand-off between the United States and Iran erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month, while Britain has called on Iran to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals imprisoned there.Charles told the Sunday Times he tries to be a peacemaker and that he has prayed for peace in the Middle East.“I do think the most important thing is a just and lasting peace,” he said in the interview, echoing comments he made on Friday during a visit to the Holy Land.Britain’s royal family steers clear of politics, though Charles, who will become governor of the Church of England when he ascends the throne, has long spoken out on issues such as inter-faith dialogue and the environment.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its reading of 52.9, up from 50.0 in December, was also at a 16-month high, while the rebound in manufacturing to an eight-month high of 49.5 was not enough to tip over the line into expansion.Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg\u0026nbspBank, said that the jump in the PMI for January provides yet more evidence that UK economic activity has started to turn up sharply since the election.“Brexit progress, the promise of a big fiscal stimulus in spring, and the end of the risk that far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could one day become prime minister have lifted confidence and lowered uncertainty,” he said.Market traders pared back their prediction of the likelihood of a rate cut from 70 per cent on Friday to less than 50 per cent after the release of the\u0026nbspPMI data.Simon Wells, chief European economist\u0026nbspat HSBC, said that, on balance, he believed the PMI survey would keep the Bank of England on hold at the last meeting of its monetary policy committee to be chaired by outgoing governor Mark Carney.However, he added: “Before the market races to price out any chance of rate cuts this year, it is worth keeping in mind that GDP and retail sales data were very weak, and inflation has been soft.“The PMI is still consistent with a 0.2 per cent quarterly GDP growth rate, in line with the BoE\u0027s November forecast, and still fairly sluggish. We therefore still think a rate cut could happen in May, although January now looks less likely.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was the lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in the final quarter of 2009 when it hit 9.5 per cent.The fall was driven by a sharp fall in profits in the North Sea oil and gas, that slimmed to 1.3 per cent from 2.3 per cent as the prices of both fuels fell in the third quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, the drop in profits was witnessed across business with services firms suffering a 0.4 points fall to 15.2 per cent and manufacturers down by a steeper 0.9 points to 11.1 per cent.Earlier this week figures showed the number of firms issuing profits warnings hit a four-year high in the final quarter of last year, according to business advisers EY.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe stands next to her father Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and his mother Barbara, as they address the media in Downing Street following a meeting with Prime Minister Boris JohnsonRosa Connolly takes a close look during a preview of the Tyrannosaurs exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland, EdinburghThe sun sets behind tower cranes and the London skyline in the city financial districtPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in London.

The share of companies warning in 2019 hit 17.8 per cent, just surpassing 2008’s figure at the peak of the financial crisis. A third of FTSE-listed retailers issued warnings in 2019.The figures came as the retail industry said shops shed 57,000 jobs in 2019 as employment in the once-vibrant high street and shopping centre contracted for the fourth successive year.The British Retail Consortium said the total number of retail employees fell by 1.8 per cent in the final three months of 2019 compared with a year earlier. Full time employment fell by 3.0 per cent and part-time by 1.2 per cent.This was the 16th consecutive quarterly fall, which the BRC said was “proof” that the transformation of the retail industry was ongoing.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive said it was essential the government used its review of the business rates system for a reform of a tax that fall disproportionately heavily on retailers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her husband grows rice during the rainy season and the rest of the time performs duties as a marabou (fortune teller). Djifanghor, 27, is a single mother who lives alone in the village of Niaguis with her mother. After her father died in 2008 her eldest brother was forced to work away to protect the family income. Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Her parents have always traditionally farmed rice \u0026amp peanut crops but have noticed the rainy season is unstable – sometimes there is more rain and sometimes there is not enough. Elie, 27, along with her family fled Oussouye in the Ziguinchor Region of Senegal in 1998 at the height of the conflict. She recalls stories of how the rebel groups lit fuel around shelters and make-shift homes and those residents who tried to escape were shot. “I still hear the crying and screams of those who perished … that is still what I have in my mind”. Dry inlet at Mandina village near Sedhiou. In recent years water reserves where Cattle used to graze the lush grass at the bank has dropped significantly. All that remains are the discarded nets from a once active fishing area for locals, now a vast area of cracked mud and salt crystals.Khady, 32, lives 4km from Ziguinchor. She participated in both the Agricultural Training camp in December 2018 and spent 3 months at the Incubation camp where she learnt how to transform her crops.A dry inlet bed at Mandina near Sedhiou, where cattle once grazed the lush vegetation on the banks – now all that remains are their footprints and hoof marksAlima, 31, says her ancestors have always been farmers: “My mother, my grandmother and my great grandmother all were, but they farmed very differently. They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”Fatou, 30, comes from a family of farmers approximately 20km away from the village of Bousra where she now lives with her son Ibu.

They would grow rice, maize and millet only, whereas we are choosing what is easier for us to grow. We can now make more profit than in the past.” Cezi, 29, lives in Carounate, near Ziguinchor. Her father was killed in 1995 during the conflict when she was just 4 years old. “A lot of people were killed on the same day in my area, houses were destroyed and several families were forced to move away. “My schooling was affected – I felt ashamed when the others talked about their fathers and I didn’t have one. It all affected my studies.” She explains how hard the period was for her family, in particular her mother. “She used to drink alcohol as she said it was the only way to forget the ‘bad souvenirs’ (memories) from that day.” Cezi is one of 11 family members at home.The Ampa Awagna project since its introduction in 2017 has trained 354 students in agricultural techniques and empowered 90 participants with the knowledge and skill to start their own companies. Projects like these are monumental in a region where 72 per cent of young people live on less than £1.50 per day. Famatou, 32, lives in the village of Saleykegna. She has struggled in the past to provide enough food for her family to eat. She explained how she had heard the Ampa Awagna project was providing small scale farmers with improved techniques growing crops to increase yields. Since her training, her onions have doubled in size and she has the ability to earn well and provide for her five children. “I get one production and I can earn 35,000 CFA (£54). I’m very happy now that my vegetable garden is doing better. I hope it will continue to be successful, otherwise, this will affect my family, I just love to see my garden grow.”Aida, 36, lives in Takou village, near Sedhiou. She has five children and is 8 months pregnant but still works tirelessly on her small holding and with her chickens. The family only eat twice a day but Aida has a business plan to grow her poultry farm. “My mother used to grow rice and peanuts just for food. People still do grow these here but only in the rainy season, which is very short. Lydie, 25, lives in Boukitingho near Ziguinchor. She attended the Ampa Awagna Y CareYMCA course and learned how to upscale the vegetables she grows by turning produce from the market into syrup, juice and marmalade. This enables her to earn a more consistent income the whole year-round. She is already teaching other women in the village the new skills she learned at the course. “We have a joint piece of land in the village where we can grow our crops, and there we grow carrots, salad, onions and maize.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to climate change. Beneficiaries like Fatou are able to create sustainable lives for themselves and their families.Bouya, 23, lives in a village on the outskirts of Kolda. An orphan, she lost both her parents to illness. Until now Bouya has been totally dependent on her uncle for support. “I’ve just completed the agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna and I am now planning to develop my own smallholding. The plot of land belonged to my father.  My idea is to start growing okra, lettuce, tomato and cucumber – okra is a great crop because it is resistant to the heat.Laurentine, 26, runs a smallholding of pigs near Kolda. She is using the new farming methods she learnt on the Ampa Awangna camp and is extremely positive about the future. “Before the training, we used traditional methods. The programme taught me the modern way is to keep them in the shelter as when they wander around they can bring back diseases”. She now has 40 pigs and hopes in the next 10 years to move to a much larger holding where she wants 200-300 pigs.Belange, 23, lives in the village of Soutoure, near Kolda. Having excelled at the initial 2-week agricultural training camp at Ampa Awagna, Belange was asked to complete the 50-day intensive agricultural camp. She explained: “When I returned, I started growing in my vegetable garden, rearing pigs and poultry. I am earning much more than I did before the training. I’m growing tomatoes, peppers and chillis and I have much more output. Our life is better now – we don’t need to get help from others or have to ask people for money.”Khady, 32, watering her crops of Aubergine and Ochre near Ziguinchor. Watering the crops to ensure they produce the best yields takes several hours a day.A beneficiary of the Y CareYMCA Ampa Awagna, Belange, 23 stands marking the spot, where the rice harvest should have reached. The deficit in rice crop yields (the staple diet) reported by several farmers or total crop-losses due to inconsistent rainfall have pushed vulnerable households with depleted food stocks to begin using negative coping strategies such as decreasing the number of meals per day for the family. Alphonse George Manga, regional executive secretary for YMCA Senegal, explained: “We are in a changing world, we can’t stay in the past. For this century things are changing for the better for women. I think in the future there will be a role reversal. Where previously, women were required to stay at home, they are now far more skilled and empowered. They can do and be whatever they want if they are just given a chance and a little bit of help.”According to estimates from UN agencies, the conflict in Casamance, Senegal, claimed the lives of over 5,000 people. The Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamance (MFDC) emerged in 1982 as an armed separatist group advocating for independence, creating a guerilla force who began attacks on the Senegalese army in 1990.In lower Casamance, 78 villages were completely destroyed, creating\u0026nbspover 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and subjected them to a life of fewer opportunities. Tens of thousands also crossed borders seeking refuge in Guinea-Bissau and the Gambia.Although an eventual ceasefire was implemented in 2014, today few MFDC combatants remain and violent incidents are in decline. The fear of sporadic attacks has now been replaced by far greater fears of youth unemployment and food insecurities driven by the changing climate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHigh levels of poverty and hunger persist in Senegal despite solid economic growth in recent years. Chronic malnutrition affects\u0026nbspapproximately 17 per cent of children younger than 5 years of age, according to the UN World Food Program.Countries in the Sahel who rely on agriculture as primary sources of food and income are most at risk of crises and disasters. Unpredictable weather patterns, frequent droughts, floods and land desalinisation threaten the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.In Dakar, street artists from all over the world make their markThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated: “A number of countries in Africa who already face semi-arid conditions may see a reduction in projected crop yield by up to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin 2020 and reduced revenues by as much as 90 per cent by 2100.”However, a new generation of small scale farming has emerged from women in the region. They are defying\u0026nbspwhat predominantly male farming practices\u0026nbsphave done for generations and are adapting to the climate changes.Most Senegalese\u0026nbsphave noticed changes in the weather and seasons – they talk of drought, increases in temperature and distinctly shorter rainy seasons but most do not draw the connection with global climate change.Y Care International, the YMCA’s aid and development charity, is empowering young women across the world and is supporting a programme in Senegal to address youth unemployment and help the next generation of farmers adapt to the climate crisis.Leigh Daynes, CEO for Y Care International, explains:\u0026nbsp“The high unemployment and poverty levels experienced by young people in this remote and rural area of Casamance have only been further exacerbated by climate change.

You erased a continent.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd in a video statement, the 23-year-old added that, for the first time in her life, she now “understood the definition of the word racism”.The cropped image was made available to news outlets across the world after being taken by the Associated Press news agency following a press call in the Swiss town.It said it had removed Ms Nakate only to improve the picture’s composition and it had not acted with “ill intent”.David Ake, director of photography, said: “The photographer was trying to get a picture out fast under a tight deadline and cropped it purely on composition grounds because he thought the building in the background was distracting.“When we went back to add more pictures to the report, which we almost always do when we are working under very tight deadlines, we added additional pictures with different crops.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

The incidents follow on from the first cases in Europe being confirmed by France on Friday night, and a second instance of the virus in the US.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will raise its response level to emergency, the highest available, and close primary and secondary schools after five people in the region who had visited Wuhan were confirmed to have been infected.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Russia is also believed to be looking into evacuating\u0026nbspthe region of its citizens, according to the state’s RIA news agency.French automotive group PSA, maker of the Peugeot and Citroen brands, has offered a similar service to their staff in the area.China rushes to build hospitals following coronavirus outbreakTwo separate studies – one conducted by Imperial College London and another by Lancaster University – have said that for every person currently infected, the disease is passed on to between two and three people.“It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China,” said Professor Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College LondonTesting for the disease could also be complicated by the way the virus presents in patients. Two of the three people who have been diagnosed with the virus in France arrived in the country without showing symptoms, doctors at a Paris hospital told reporters.However, French officials have said they feel that the threat of a full-blown outbreak remains low in Europe.Leading physician Dr Yazdan Yazdanpanah said cases imported from China were “not a surprise” and that France had prepared, including by developing a test that provides rapid results for suspected cases.On the other hand, he said, the chance of “an epidemic in France or in Europe is weak, extremely weak”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Prince Charles will see to that.Harry will continue to receive £million from his father, but although Charles has amassed a personal fortune of over £million, the money might not be coming from that closely guarded pot.The prince could instead be paying him through a outdated racket called the Duchy of Cornwall.Charles could claim this as a business expense which means he can reduce the amount of tax he pays. The public would be paying for Harry by the back door.Harry of course has no connection with this sprawling property company called the Duchy, but that has never stopped Charles benefiting from its special tax status.The status of the Duchy has been contested for decades and while Charles insists it is private, thats strongly disputed by others.Charles has also claimed as business expenses the cost of  personal staff to pamper him – butlers, valets, gardeners.He had the cheek to argue that Camilla’s personal costs even before they married were a Duchy expense so claimed for her staff, her travel, her jewellery, and the stabling of her horses.And he got away with it. The line was only drawn when he tried to claim his polo ponies as business expenses.In my time in Parliament I saw plenty of MPs claiming for duck houses, moat cleaning and the like. Is this dferent So what is this Duchy  Well it’s not just in Cornwall where it has land. Its tentacles stretch far and wide. It even owns the Oval cricket ground. Extra cover for the Prince as he hits the taxpayer for six.The Duchy turns in a profit of over £million a year. That is money that many argue should go straight to the Treasury. Instead it becomes pocket money for the Prince.He has reluctantly agreed he should pay tax on this money but the vast array of creative expenses he conjures up means in a recent year when the Duchy made £.million, only £.million was paid in tax at  per cent.That can only be explainedhe dreamed up more than £million in expenses.Charles says the Duchy is a “private estate” — which it is legally, but it acts like a public body that reverts to the Crown when theres no Duke of Cornwall.It has had notices served on it by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency and they can only be served on a public body.It is the harbour authority for the Isles of Scilly. The Information Commissioner has ruled it is public.But by insisting it is private means the Duchy’s accounting practices can be hidden away. No right of access for the National Audit Office. No freedom of information.If you go cap in hand and bow and scrape, they might let you see some old Duchy paperwork. On the other hand, they might not.In this medieval throwback, Charles scoops up the property of anybody who dies without leaving a will. The general right for a King or Queen to do this was abolished in . But not in the Duchy.Yet this so-called private estate suddenly becomes public when it suits Charles. Unlike any other private estate in Britain, it doesn’t pay any corporation tax or capital gains tax.No wonder Charles is worth over £million.Suddenly the private Prince becomes a public figure, demanding – and getting – the right to change government legislation that affects the Duchy in a way he doesn’t like.To be fair, he does pay the market rent for the vast property he occupies at Highgrove. He pays it to the Duchy which then s the money to him, tax-free, as the Duke of Cornwall in a sort of merry money-go-round.He got Duchy employees to grow trees on Duchy land and then sold the timber to... The Duchy. Charles pocketed £.million tax free for this racket.The Duchy of Cornwall is not some hobby growing a bit of organic lettuce here and there. Nor is it a small collection of twee cottages as you might infer from the pictures the Duchy uses in its publications.No, it is a hard-headed ruthless property company with advantages in tax and law that no other company has.It is a massive money-making machine for Prince Charles, money that rightly belongs to us all but that he erts to himself.It’s time for this medieval monstrosity to be sorted out.

Which they are on ­commercial rivals like Nick Ferrari on LBC or Julia Hartley-Brewer on TalkRADIO.At least those stations don’t start from a position of: “Brexit is evil and a majority Tory government isn’t much ­better.”No one is proposing for a single second the BBC be axed. But the poll tax that funds it should be.Its websites that write clickbait about TV shows like Love Island — well ­covered by other online outlets — should be stopped too. Not to mention its recent push into the already saturated podcast market.The BBC’s job is not to be a monolith, shutting out commercial organisations and dominating the entertainment and news industries.That’s what makes yesterday’s decision to axe Victoria Derbyshire’s BBC programme ridiculous.Her award-winning morning show is one of the only news programmes on the ­corporation to properly cover the working class.It is unbiased, feisty, fair and will cover entertainment stories or whatever happens to be the splash of The Sun that day, without the snobbery of the rest of BBC News.That sort of non-commercial show is just the type the Beeb should be making. But — of course — under its latest cuts, it is the first to go.The next Director-General must be an outsider who understands the madness of the BBC’s current priorities and is ­prepared to enact real change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And climate change, whether the prince wants to acknowledge it or not, is an innately political issue.Two of the world’s biggest players – the US and China – are nowhere close to where we are on the so-called crisis.It’s up to Boris Johnson to criticise them and for Charles to calm them down with ceremonial State visits.Sure, Charles should be offering his support and sympathy to the people of Australia impacted by bushfires, for example.Perhaps he could even visit the area and talk about the damage.But offering a ten-point solution politicians should enact is insane – especially given he flew to Davos on a £, private jet trip that emitted six tonnes of carbon.If the hypocritical prince is so impetuous that he can’t see the time has come for his role to change, I genuinely fear for the Royal Family.The last thing the country needs is another two-bit political wannabe trying to gain popularity on the back of Greta.What we desperately need is a future king who can bring us together beyond politics and beyond the embarrassing PR mess engulfing his family.CHRIS MARTIN swore at fans this week who were trying to get his autograph following a Coldplay gig in LA.Shocking, isn’t it  Who asks for an autograph these days How vintage. ORLANDO BLOOM will voice Prince Harry in a comedy cartoon called The Prince for US broadcaster HBO, which is set to poke fun at our calamitous royals.I hope the actor has put in the hours perfecting how to whinge relentlessly. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-UP-SUGGS-v-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-DW-DOWN-COCAINE-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her. And after they had shaken hands and exchanged pleasantries, she turned to the photographers and called a halt to proceedings.I’m not sure she had a clue who Charlie Boy was. But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way. But I have a Range Rover and I’m not sure I like thinking that some herbert in Solihull knows where I am  hours a day. CHANNEL  News achieved new heights of unbalanced reporting this week while covering a pro-gun march in America.Instead of asking protesters why they wanted a machine gun, and then allowing the viewer to make up their mind, the reporter pounced on a family and asked the children why they were there.Needless to say, the kids had no clue and turned in baffled silence to their parents.I’m willing to bet, however, thatyou asked kids on an eco march why they were there, you’d get exactly the same response.But would Channel  News do that  Don’t hold your breath.I told the woman my name was Jeremy Clarkson. I told her the name on my credit card was Jeremy Clarkson. And that my account was in the name of Jeremy Clarkson.And when I’d finished, she said, with some excitement: “Hey!!

And none are genuine refugees — or they would stay put in the EU which, as tearful Europhiles will tell you, is a welcoming, safe, liberal paradise.Britain must continue to rescue real refugees from warzone camps.Economic migrants from the EU, like everywhere , can come in on merit.THE Government is right to condemn America over Harry Dunn.It is taking our special relationship for granted.It tries to bully us over taxes on its tech giants, issues threats over Huawei and outrageously hides a death crash driver. Britain is right to push back.The US insists Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. But it could rescind that. It simply refuses.President Trump presumably thinks he must side with US citizens come what may. But most of them also believe Mrs Sacoolas should face justice.She won’tvoluntarily. She doesn’t want to — and says a potential jail term wouldn’t be “proportional”.That is for a judge to decide. Mrs Sacoolas’s apparent negligence killed a young man. Even accidents have consequences.If she or Trump have any sense of right and wrong, she will be flown back.THE historic Brexit Bill is signed off. In less than a week we will be out.It is an extraordinary achievement by Boris Johnson and his team, though trade talks will still be challenging.One thing bothers us. Why does the EU still let Michel Barnier run the show His error, in plotting with Remainers trying to stop us leaving, ultimately triggered the “hard Brexit” they feared.That same ill-judged pig-headedness now could jeopardise entire industries.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thirty per cent of university vice-chancellors are women. In , it was just  per cent.But the pace of change is dismally slow.In some areas we have even gone backwards —  per cent of public bodies are chaired by women but in  that figure was  per cent.There are more female MPs than ever but they make up just  per cent of the total number. Just  per cent of peers in the House of Lords are Ladies.Then there are the supposedly family-friendly careers such as education — but just  per cent of secondary school head teachers are female.Perhaps it is less surprising that just over one in  chief executives of FTSE  companies are women, two in six national newspaper editors and one in five bosses of national sport governing bodies.You get the idea.Women make up nearly half the UK workforce but there are nowhere near enough of us in top jobs.Change is not happening nearly swtly enough.Clearly, the best candidates shouldget these jobs but, too often, women are being overlooked by male selection . They are still seen as a burden by some employers.And why  Motherhood.We are still being made redundant or sacked after having babies. Eleven per cent of new mums suffer this fate, according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission.Or  these women are treated so poorly that they feel they have to leave their jobs.This contributes to , women each year losing their employment.In the meantime, almost half of employers think it is quite reasonable, during the recruitment process, to ask female candidates whether or not they have children.Forty-one per cent of employers believe pregnancy in the workplace puts “an unnecessary cost burden” on firms, and that working mums are a burden to their teams.This is a problem.It’s a fact of le that women give birth. So must we simply accept that, until babies can be grown outside the womb, women will be discriminated against at work No.The working mums I employ are among my hardest-working and most productive employees.But STILL we miss out on the top jobs, despite efforts to close the gender gap in industry — and all the positive campaigning.I could not agree more with Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, who says: “Despite much lip service being paid to the importance of having women in top jobs, today’s data shows we are still generations away from achieving anything close to equality. We are wasting women’s talent and skills.”In other words, too many big companies are all talk and no action.Smethers thinks we need quotas, targets and policy interventions to remove barriers and promote change.I agree with her.But we also need more research so we can really understand the problem.We need to trust workers when it comes to flexible working and job-sharing.We need to see more men taking parental leave.But perhaps most of all, we need high-quality, affordable childcare so women and men can all go to work knowing that their children are being well looked after.Then we might see some real change.And I struggle to understand what a G-string can shape.What I want from shapewear is maximum coverage, ideally starting under my chin and finishing at my ankles.Let’s face it, that is the only sure way to hold anything in.In Open: Why Asking For Help Can Save Your Le, Frankie tells the story of going straight from shooting the video for The Saturdays’ single My HeartTakes Over in Iceland to being driven to London’s private Nightingale Hospital by her now-husband Wayne, the former England footballer.I really feel for Frankie and it’s awful she had such a hard time.

No one cuts contact with their family lightly.And the fact Thomas has continued to do interviews, despite his daughter’s repeated heartfelt pleas, is a good indication of why she feels she can’t trust him.Mr Markle, it is time to let go. Meghan has.THE story of the retired welder who lamented the fact his phone had not rung for months did not quite make sense to me.Taysider Alan Hattel, , realised his friends had discovered his gravestone had been commissioned by his ex-we – and believed him to be already dead.He said: “My phone has not rung for three or four months.

I collapsed. I was dying in the street.”Lynsey and Scott were waiting for a cab outside her cousin’s home in Greenock when they were suddenly encircled by a gang of thugs.They hurled wine bottles at the innocent couple before Warnock, who was also armed with a kne, launched the shocking attack.She said: “I heard a car door slam and when I looked around, we were surrounded.“They started throwing bottles at me. I went over to ask why they were doing that and somebody shouted, ‘Do the b***h in’.“Warnock tried to chop my head off and he would have managedit hadn’t been for my boyfriend.”The severity of the attack sent Lynsey crashing to the ground as Scott grabbed at the monster’s legs in a brave bid to fend him off.Scott said: “Warnock was standing on a wall with a meat cleaver in his right hand and a kitchen kne in his left.“He started shouting at us. I tried to throw Lynsey out the way, I told her to run.“I used to study taekwondo so I tried to grab a hold of him and sweep his legs.“But I’ve got arthritis in both hands and they weren’t strong enough. That’s when he went for me as well.”Despite blood pouring from a wound above his eye, Scott pulled off his T-shirt in a desperate bid to stem the flow gushing from Lynsey’s neck.He went on: “Every time I got close to her the blood was dripping off me and landing on her.“The gang only ran off when I shouted, ‘You’re going to kill her’.”Panic-stricken Scott then tried to flag down passing cars to help — eventually stopping a taxi driver who called for cops and an ambulance, which arrived within minutes.He added: “If it wasn’t for that ambulance being so close, she wouldn’t have made it.”The dad then had to wait in the street for more medics to arrive as the first crew sped off with Lynsey.He suffered a fractured skull and a five-inch blade wound above his right eye which needed  stitches.Doctors warned he would have lost his sight had the cleaver connected any lower.He also suffered cuts to his stomach and back in the frenzied attack and spent three days in hospital.Lynsey lost two pints of blood and was unconscious when she reached Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.

But we never abandoned the fight to run our own country.Today, with foreign cash flooding into the UK economy, new jobs and rising prosperity, we can claim we did our bit.By the time we finally break free at pm on Friday, in a blaze of celebratory fireworks, we will have spent nearly half a century at the heart of Europe.Most of us will be glad to wave goodbye.We will retake command of our borders. Germany can invite as many unvetted migrants as it likes. We will not be bound by the European Court of Justice.The Queen, privately believed to be a staunch Brexiteer, has signed our release. Her consent to the Withdrawal Act delivers Boris Johnson’s  Brexit pledge: Take Back Control.The EU anthem, Beethoven’s Ode To Joy, struck a sour note for many British voters — especially our fishermen, who saw their billion pound industry gobbled up by marauding foreign fleets.For all Ted Heath’s sly denials, his goal from the outset was to bind the whole continent into a federal superstate — a country called Europe. Then, in , a bombshell document revealed how he sold us down the river.Lord Chancellor Lord Kilmuir, the Government’s most senior law officer, had warned him of “serious surrenders of sovereignty” which “ought to be brought out into the open”.Heath ignored the warning, kept it under wraps and pressed on into Europe. The Sun was among the first to spot the covert and hotly denied plot to build a superstate.We became the siren voice of disillusioned voters against Brussels’ meddling in what Europhile Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called “every nook and cranny of public le”.We made le hell for faceless bureaucrats and dud EU politicians. We were denounced as “scaremongers”. Other countries struggled in vain against power-grabbing regulation and slippery treaty changes.Brussels’ own EuroStat polls revealed deep misgivings among its million citizens over the drive to centralise power over currencies and borders.During the  Brexit campaign, the anti-EU mood was even stronger in France. President Emmanuel Macron admitted he would not dare risk a referendum there.He remembered the s, when France, Ireland and Denmark balked at a pan-European Constitution turning them into EU colonies. They voted No — only to be told to keep voting until they got it right.Eventually the Constitution was imposed by stealth as the Lisbon Treaty — and the EU decided never to risk consulting the people about anything ever again.In the s, the Commission launched an experiment, aptly known as “The Snake”, to abolish national currencies.We raised the alarm, but in  the European Commission president Jacques Delors pressed ahead with plans for the ill-fated euro.Our stunning Page One headline, “Up Yours Delors”, published that year on November , has echoed down the decades.Thousands of Sun readers heeded our call to face East at noon, and “bawl at Gaul”.In a pincer movement, we invaded Brussels with an armoured car full of Page  girls.Our offensive was greeted with thin smiles . . . of panic. The Sun and its coverage of EU twists and turns became compulsory reading in the chancellories of Europe.I was told our stories and editorials dominated Foreign Office cables to embassies across the EU.In the battle to save the Pound, it really was The Sun what won it.It was this newspaper that stopped Tony Blair, then all-powerful after two election triumphs, from scrapping Sterling and signing up to the single currency without a referendum.With The Sun in opposition, he had no chance of winning.Today, our stand is vindicated.Despite Project Fear’s darkest predictions, the UK economy as we prepare to leave is growing faster than any other country in Europe.Our jobless tally has plunged to . per cent — the nearest thing to full employment and the envy of the blighted eurozone.Millions of jobless young Europeans have flocked here in search of work they cannot find at home. Foreign firms are lining up to invest in UKplc.The number of French people living in London is enough to make it France’s sixth-biggest city.Brussels’ deepest fear is a Pied Piper effect as other member states watch the UK break free from an undemocratic political bloc and follow suit.As The Sun’s Political Editor for  years, I enjoyed a ringside seat at summits and conferences around Europe, alongside Prime Ministers from Thatcher to Blair.The power of nation states, leached away to Brussels, was the issue at every gathering.In the end, it brought down arguably Britain’s greatest peace-time Prime Minister.Margaret Thatcher’s final blazing act of defiance before she was kicked out of office is seared in my memory.She told a cheering House of Commons: “What is the point of trying to get elected to Parliament only to hand over your Sterling and hand over the powers of this House to Brussels ”She accused Jacques Delors of erting Parliament’s power to tame MEPs, an unelected Commission and an unaccountable Council of Ministers.“No. No. No!” she stormed.Days later, she was out of office. But her words became a rallying cry to the Conservative Party’s army of Eurosceptics.These were the “Tory bastards” who made le hell for John Major as he signed the Maastricht Treaty, clearing the way for political and economic union.They were the “swivel-eyed lunatics” who eight years later fought the euro, which was the greatest act of economic self-harm in peacetime Europe.Britain thankfully kept its own currency. They were Sun readers who flocked to Nigel Farage’s Ukip and, later, his lethally effective Brexit Party.From the very start, Brussels has been besieged by allegations of cheating and corruption.In , the entire European Commission — including Transport Commissioner and ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock — were forced to quit amid damning claims of “fraud and nepotism”.Ironically, Kinnock had started political le, along with Tony Benn and pet parrot Jeremy Corbyn, as ardent anti-marketeers — only to jump aboard the EU gravy train as a well-paid Commissioner, together with his we, Glenys, and son, Stephen, now a Labour MP.Even Kinnock could not match scheming svengali Peter Mandelson, whose road to riches began as EU Trade Commissioner with controversial links to Russian aluminium oligarch Oleg Deripaska.It was this twisted relationship with Brussels and Labour’s chaotic stance on Brexit which — among other things — cost them the last election.How will it end Britain will thrive and prosper. Without us, and our £billion a year, the European Union will struggle to survive.Nov   — Up Yours, DelorsOUR legendary front page headline was in response to European Commission president Jacques Delors’ efforts to force us into a European superstate. Margaret Thatcher was fiercely opposed – and his plans melted away.Feb   — Maastricht TreatyPM John Major signed away much of Britain’s sovereignty in the treaty that formed the newly named European Union. The UK did win some opt-outs – from the single currency and social chapter – but critics say it still undermined the supremacy of our Parliament.May   — EU EnlargementLABOUR PM Tony Blair opened the door to migrants from ten new member states – including seven from the ex-Soviet bloc – without the restrictions imposed by Germany, France and Italy. Estimates of , migrants a year were wildy off the peak figure of , in  alone.June  — Second ReferrendumAFTER being elected Ukip leader in , Nigel Farage drove the campaign for an in-out referendum, something that had often been promised but never delivered.

The historic vote came on June  the next year.Dec   — General ElectionFOLLOWING a bitter three years of Brexit wrangling – on top of five decades of disputes over the EU – the question is finally settled by a General Election.

I could really do with money like that.  Before I knew it, the words were out of my mouth: ‘Well, I’d do it for £.’ If I knew one thing about my boss, it was that he loved a bargain. ‘Deal,’ he said. And that was that. No training, no nothing, just pencils and paper thrust in my hand, and the words: ‘Just command the room, right ’ Er, OK… Dutch courage My first job was utterly terrying. Whatit was a total disaster  Whatthe girls just laughed  Oh God... ‘There’s no way I can do this sober,’ I thought, knocking back a few drinks first to try to calm my nerves. I was still incredibly embarrassed when it was time to undo my pinny and stand there stark naked in front of  girls. ‘It’s my first job, go easy on me,’ I said, desperately hoping that might lower everyone’s expectations.  I poured the girls extra-strong shots, handed out pencils and paper and got into what I hoped was a flattering position. ‘Right, girls, let’s draw!’ And they did. It sounds strange, but within five minutes I didn’t feel like I was naked, I was just having a chat. Ninety minutes later I was £ richer and hugely relieved. The girls seemed to have had a fun time, and now it was all over I decided I’d rather enjoyed it too. The more jobs I did, the easier it became, although there was always that slight fear of the unknown. A couple of ex girlfriends were getting married at the time and I couldn’t stop thinking, ‘Whatit’s their hen party ’ Luckily that didn’t happen, but my worst-ever job was walking out to see someone I knew from university. I could have died as she sat there staring at my naked body, clearly wondering what I was doing with my degree. Most hen parties were pretty classy. Very occasionally I’d get a room of drunken women who’d just draw a stick man with a penis, but most really got into the class. A light bulb moment The bookings grew and grew until I was doing up to four jobs a day at weekends. It struck me there could be a whole business in this – like Butlers In The Buff, but for le drawing. The name came to me first: Nude Le. I bought the website domain for £, then started looking for le models. The first one I signed up was actually Henry from the pub! That was , and now we have over  guys on our books, as well as a few girls.  We do everything from corporate events to team building and birthdays, but hen parties are still our bread and butter. It’s a simple format. The hens choose three poses and the last one involves the bride too. That final pose can get a bit cheekythe hens suggest doing a sex position, and we’ve even had a couple of brides strip off too! But it’s always just fun, never seedy. The number one question I’m asked by male models is: what happensI get an erection  It does happen occasionally!

Thousands of troops are on standby to prop up essential services and emergency medical carethe killer coronavirus reaches the UK. On Saturday the death toll hit  in China and several more countries confirmed cases of the disease. These include three in France, which means the virus has travelled nearly , miles from the city of Wuhan, to just across the Channel. So far tests on  Brits sus-pected of having snake flu – which has an incubation period of up to  days – have come back negative. But experts fear its arrival here is inevitable. Health chiefs, airlines and border force agents are desperately trying to trace , people who recently travelled between Wuhan and Britain. And GPs have been told anyone they even suspect of having the virus must immediately be placed in isolation. A senior defence source said: “At the moment we are playing a waiting game. “The medical advice is the virus will arrive in the UK soon. But its impact is the big unknown. “We have to plan for the worst case scenario – that is the virus spreads across the UK and infects a large proportion of the population. “If that happens troops will be deployed to carry out vital roles, like the transportation of food and fuel. They may also operate fire engines and drive ambulances. “These are all things troops have done in the past. They could also be used to deal with any civil unrest.”  Under MoD plans, the decision to deploy the Army will be taken at the “highest level”. They also require medical personnel specialising in environmental health and infectious diseases to be put on high alert. In China more than , cases of snake flu have been confirmed, but that number is expected to skyrocket. President Xi Jinping yesterday confirmed the spread of the disease is speeding up. He said: “Faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread of the new coronavirus...it is necessary to strengthen the centralised and unied leadership.”  As he spoke, builders were rushing to complete a ,-patient hospital, dedicated to treating the coronavirus. It is due to open in Wuhan – home to million – in just five days. Tragically the disease has also claimed the le of at least one doctor. Liang Wudong, , died of exhaustion on Friday. A second medic, Jiang Jijun, has also reportedly died from a heart attack, also caused by exhaustion. Videos filmed in Chinese hospitals show other medics collaps-ing and patients lying on the floor in overcrowded corridors. Outside the hospitals, streets are deserted as million citizens have been warned to stay at home. The lockdown comes just as millions of families gather to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Snake flu, also known as the Wuhan virus, or more officially as -nCoV, can cause severe pneumonia.

Both children were captured and sent to concentration camps. We hear tragic Anne’s testimony only through her ­diary. But Martin lived to tell his tale. He still shares it during school visits and stresses his gratitude to the brave souls who defied the Nazis to help him avoid Anne’s fate. Speaking ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day tomorrow, he said: “I owe my le to so many others.” Martin was five when his ordeal began. His mother died giving birth to sister Erica and his father was sent to die at the Buchenwald camp. The children were taken in by dferent families and Martin was cared for by Cathrien and Johannes Rademakers. Posing as the Dutch couple’s child, he went to school. But the Gestapo got wind. Martin, , said: “One day two men walked in wearing civilian clothes and asked, ‘Is Martin Stern here ’ The teacher shot back ‘No, he hasn’t come in today.’ I put my hand up and said, ‘But I am here’.” Martin was led to a room where they had Johannes.  He said: “I recognised Johannes, of course. He’d been looking after me in his flat around the ­corner from the Anne Frank house.” When Martin called out to him, Johannes was dragged away. He was sent to Neuengamme camp, near Hamburg, where he died. Martin would be held in two ­concentration camps. The first, in , was Westerbork, where Jews were held before being shipped to extermination sites. Unknown to Martin, Erica had also been found and sent to Westerbork – where the Frank family were held. He said: “We lived in ­wooden creosoted huts which were crowded, the food was terrible and there was little of it.” From there, Martin went to Theresienstadt in Terezin, north of Prague. He ­remembers the stench of the ­cattle train and being packed tightly against strangers sharing a single bucket for a toilet.  But mostly he ­recalls wondering why an old man was ­allowed so much space to lie on the floor. Martin said: “Everyone had squeezed back from him and I was asking why he was sleeping with his eyes open I had never seen a corpse before.” Children had little chance of survival in Theresienstadt. Of , sent there, , are thought to have lived. Martin said: “It was ­disgustingly crowded. The ­sewage, ­water ­and food were ­inadequate and we still wore the clothes we were ­arrested in. It stank.” Martin and Erica were saved by a Dutch woman called Catharina Casoeto De Jong, who was ­imprisoned for marrying a Jew. She started looking after them, taking them to her women’s dorm and ­stealing food for them. When a cattle truck arrived to take children to Auschwitz, their names were miraculously not on the list.

The -year-old wants everyone to see this heartrending picture of herself in a -day coma with multiple fractures to her face, arms, ribs and spine – as she today calls on the Government to ban drivers from drinking at all. Fraya’s world was torn apart by serial drink-drive offender Adam White last January. He was twice the legal limit when his van ploughed head-on into her mum Kate’s car at mph as he overtook a truck on a single carriageway. Kate’s Peugeot was catapulted into the air and landed upside down, killing her and leaving passengers Fraya and her little brother Zackeri, then eight, in intensive care. And even as the two heartbroken children battled back from their le-changing injuries while coping with grief over the loss of their mum, White, , was again stopped for drink-driving. It was only following his conviction for that incident – five months after the fatal crash – that police charged him over -year-old Kate’s death. Now he is serving just nine years in jail – and could be out in half that time while the Cunningham family face a le sentence of grief.Fraya says: “I want the world to know what a drink-driver has done to me, what kind of damage drink-drivers cause. No one should drink and drive.” Her dad Kris, , adds: “If pictures of Fraya’s injuries save just two people then that’s a positive.I was told she had a  per cent chance of survival. To see your daughter lying there with more parts of her body broken than fixed is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. “Her stomach was left open for eight days, her arteries had ripped.” He says his family will never get over Kate’s loss. “White has destroyed everybody who knew Kate. She was the most loving person, and the best mother. She deserved more than that.  “The laws must change to no alcohol for drivers. Alcohol affects everybody dferently.” The . per cent maximum blood alcohol content allowed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is one of the most lax limits in the world and the highest in Europe. Russia, Romania and Pakistan all ban motorists consuming any alcohol. In  – the latest figures available – deaths due to drink-driving here hit an eight-year high, reaching up to  – the highest since . It was a miracle both Fraya and Zackeri survived the crash near Crowland, Lincs, in January last year. Kris, of Peterborough, was toldthe car had rolled just a little further Zackeri’s neck would have been snapped and Fraya would have been crushed to death.  Zackeri was left with a fractured neck and Fraya was put in an induced coma because of internal bleeding and a suspected brain bleed. Kris was told she suffered heart failure and had ‘died’ several times in the ambulance before reaching intensive care. “The first thought in my mind was how am I going to tell my little boy that not only his mother’s dead, but his sister’s dead,” he says. He took photos of his little girl to prepare visiting relatives for the shock of seeing her injuries. “We were taking it hour by hour, as we thought we would lose her,” he says. “You can’t describe what it feels like to look at your daughter there, with plasters on her eyes to stop them drying up. “There was nothing there. They had to drill into her head to release pressure on her brain.” When Zackeri came out of intensive care, he wanted to see his sister. He was shocked. “Until Fraya started showing signs of coming out of her coma, Zackeri hardly said a word at all,” Kris says.  “He’s suffered a lot with guilt, seeing his sister with all these broken bones and plaster casts.” She was in Peterborough City Hospital hospital for eight weeks and needed a wheelchair for many months after her discharge. She will be scarred for le. Zackeri was in a brace for six weeks and can’t play any sport. Meanwhile dad-of-six White of Spalding, Lincs, had been taken to hospital with leg injuries after the crash. At first he told police he had no memory of the accident but that he was doing Dry January so he couldn’t have been drunk. Then he later said he’d drunk a pint of cider before the crash. White had already forced a car to veer off the road before he hit Kate’s car, causing injuries to the driver. In June he was stopped by police for drink-driving and convicted of the offence in November. It wasn’t until December that he was charged in connection with Kate’s death. “Ultimately this delay could have cost another le,” says a furious Kris.  “I think everybody is very, very lucky that it didn’t.” Last week White admitted to causing death by dangerous driving and three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Peterborough Crown Court. His string of previous convictions between  and  included four drink-driving charges and three of driving while disqualied and uninsured. The serial offender had also previously admitted failing to stop at an accident, failing to provide a specimen and aggravated vehicle taking. Judge Matthew Lowe told the court he would have sentenced White to  years had he denied the charges, but his guilty plea meant it had to be knocked down to nine years.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAn aposeccentricapos man used his love for ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome as inspiration as he transformed his dingy flat into an extraordinary - yet his family had absolutely no idea about his incredible art project. When Ron Gittins passed away in September , it was the first time his elder sister, Pat Williams, had stepped inside the rented ground floor property in years.From the outside, Ronaposs home looks much the same as any of the other double-fronted Victorian terraces in Oxton Village, reports the Liverpool Echo.Apart from the pile of rubbish in the front yard and the dirty white blinds covering the windows, you wouldnapost even look twice as you passed by. But push open the front door, and inside was something no-one, particularly not Pat, could have ever imagined. The majority of the propertyaposs walls and ceilings are decorated with vivid murals, Egyptian hieroglyphics, underwater scenes and portraits of historic leaders. Andthis werenapost unusual enough, in one front room a m-tall fireplace in the shape of a lionaposs head seems to roar as you enter. And across the hall, a fierce bull-shaped fireplace scowls at the stack of rubbish piled high in the bay window. Pat, who is a former Wirral Mayor and was a Liberal Democrat councillor until she retired from politics at the age of , said: When we first went inside after he died I had the shock of my le because it was absolutely full of all sorts of stuff. How he coped in there I just donapost know. I donapost appreciate all his art but what heaposs done is incredible. The fireplaces are extraordinary. A boy soprano who later became a brilliant Buddy Holly impersonator, Ron showed promise as an artist from an early age and studied at the Laird School of Art in Birkenhead. He was a powerful orator and could quote scenes from Shakespeare in a manner that would, Pat says, give Richard Burton or Laurence Olivier a run for their money. And although he was involved in ious local acting groups, she says he didnapost like to take direction. Pat, , says: As a child he was hyperactive and very creative. When he was a boy he used to make little soldiers out of plasticine that were from all types of regiments and countries. The details in the unorms were incredible. He used to get into trouble in school for attention seeking and being what was thought to be mischevious and a little bit naughty but I think he was just bored a lot of the time. Today he would be diagnosed on the autism spectrum, Iaposm sure of it, and be treated with much more acceptance. Pat says Ron, who died a month shy of his th birthday, always displayed unusual behaviour but became more eccentric in his later years, turning up to Pataposs th birthday in a thick coat, wellies, a wig and a hat in case his head got cold.  A familiar sight in his local village, Ron would often be seen walking the streets dressed in a series of homemade military costumes and pushing an old-fashioned pram which he would fill with bags of cement used to build his gigantic fireplaces. From time to time, he was even known to take his le-sized papier mache model of Egyptian queen Cleopatra out for a stroll. After his death, a local family who were fond of her brother told Pat they used to shout Ron alertthey spotted him through the window before rushing to see what costume he was wearing. Instead of flowers on his coffin, his sister placed two of his hats and a wig in a gesture she thought he would have enjoyed. Pat and Ron stayed in touch until his death, though their relationship was sometimes strained, partially due to his own unfulfilled political ambition.  She says: He resented the fact that I was the eldest and a woman. He had this view that men are really the ones that should be in charge. But he was a very big supporter of Margaret Thatcher. However, the last time they met, Ron visited Pat at home with a big bunch of flowers for her birthday - a few months late - and they had a good chat. Pat says: I was sad that he died on his own but he didnapost want everybody to know he wasnapost well and he didnapost want to go to hospital. He lived le on his own terms. His flat is certainly proof of that - and it is now being saved by his niece Jan Williams, Pataposs daughter, who is herself an artist.  At the end of his le, he cooked on a camping stove and is thought to have slept in a sleeping bag in the hall. He had water and electricity but no gas - and consequently no central heating - because he wouldnapost allow his landlord inside to make repairs in case he ended up having to leave his home. Ron rarely invited visitors inside and Jan knows of only a few people who had been admitted in years before his death. She believes this is partly because he was house-proud and didnapost want friends or family to see how dilapidated his flat had become. But art consultant Angela Samata says Ronaposs work is a fascinating example of aposOutsider Artapos - a term used to describe work created outside the mainstream art world.  She says: Itaposs so important to keep this because itaposs not very often that we uncover these Outside Art environments that are created by an inidual like Ron for their own pleasure. Heaposs almost created this fantasy world. Itaposs wonderful to hear that so few people have stepped across the threshold. Through Ronaposs eyes, the piles of what most of us would consider to be fit only for a skip were a treasure trove of art materials. He kept things, not for the sake of it, but because he could find a use for them in his creations. Among the mountain of rubbish in the living room during our visit there are the skeleton of a pram, an Argos catalogue, the side of a ceramic bath, an empty two-litre pop bottle and a tiny pencil sketch of a mounted soldier. In the back room, beneath murals of Napoleon, Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton, the array of objects includes a Singer sewing machine, a photo of the Queen on horseback, an Airfix model kit of the German battleship Bismarck and a bag of marbles.  In the bathroom cabinet - a packet of tooth powder and a box of lawn feed. In the other front room - a collection of homemade breast plates, a wardrobe full of military jackets and other costumes, and an almost pristine phone book from June . Jan and her partner, Chris Teasdale, are now picking through what remains in the flat to work out what is valuable. Their goal is to preserve Ronaposs flat and turn it into a cultural asset for the community to share. Among their most intriguing finds are loose pages of lined A paper containing Ronaposs observations during trips to London - evidence of his claim that he worked for the Secret Service. One page, entitled Trip to London  Nov reads: . Paving stones, uneven at Russell Sq, . Passed Home Office, [...] . Charing Cross toilet, no need to pay.  Pat says: Ron told everyone he was working for the Secret Service. Even the minister at his funeral knew all about it. Keen to preserve her uncleaposs home for artists and other people to enjoy in the future, Jan has managed to secure a lease with the buildingaposs owners, social landlord Salisbury Management Services. Through theirapos artist collaboration The Caravan Gallery, she and Chris have launched a crowdfunder - Saving Ronaposs Place - to protect his legacy as an extraordinary example of Outsider Art. They would also like to restore its former entrance, which Ron had flanked with Egyptian statues that he had eventually had to remove for safety reasons.

Furious native Americans say the £million mansion on Vancouver Island, where the couple are staying with son Archie, is on territory once robbed by the Brits. And they want it back. Chief of the local Tseycum tribe Tanya Jimmy urged the royal couple: “Don’t ignore us. The land the house is built on is stolen. She explained to the Sunday Mirror: “It was taken from us in treaties signed in the s. Our people back then didn’t realise what they were doing. “Land was taken for a few hundred dollars and our people would sign the treaty with an ‘X’ as they couldn’t read or write.” Britain colonised Vancouver Island after Captain Cook arrived there in . The first British settlement came in . Speaking about Harry and Meghan’s hideaway, Tanya said: “There will be ancestors buried there. We get no money from the land now, nothing “But for us it’s just not right houses like that are built there.” Harry flew out to be reunited with Meghan and Archie this week after the Queen refused to allow his proposals for the couple to become financially independent part-time royals.The prince made it clear he was not happy with the outcome and is believed to be planning the couple’s future at the property owned by a mystery pal. While their mansion has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, living conditions among their Tseycum neighbours can be a lot more cramped. Tanya, , said: “I know one home where four generations live under one roof, several people in three bedrooms.”  She added: “Our bus service starts at am and ends at pm so people set their lives by that. It’s a world away from having drivers whenever you want.” Tanya said her community was hit hard by her country’s historical “residential school system”. She said: “It split families, took young people away from communities and destroyed them to make them ‘Western’.” As a result she said her people struggle with issues close to the royal couple’s hearts. She added: “Meghan would appreciate that women here are the ones holding our community together. We really are the glue.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe parents of a five-year-old girl have started storing up “beautul memories” of her after she was diagnosed with childhood dementia. Little Penny Mills may not live past her teens, doctors told them. The rare genetic ailment afflicting her eventually causes fatal brain ­damage. But first it will make her forget how to speak, swallow and walk. Mum Kelly said: “It’s like grieving for our little girl as we watch this cruel disease rob her of all she knows.” As a baby, Penny developed slowly but steadily. By the time she was four she could say  words, starting with her -year-old brother Harry’s name when she was  months. But her vocabulary has dwindled to ten words, which no longer include Harry or mummy as her memory is ravaged by Sanfilippo syndrome. Kelly and husband Andrew came up with the “memories bank” idea after becoming determined the family should live to the full with dance-loving Penny in her remaining time with them. She said: “Our amazing, happy little girl lights up the room with her ­laughter and we need to make the most of her while we can. Sanfilippo syndrome, dubbed childhood dementia, affects one in , UK births. Those diagnosed lack an enzyme that controls the toxic build-up of sugar in the body. The condition can cause severe neurological deterioration and ­progressive physical disability. Veterinary nurse Kelly, , said: “Its three stages start with delayed learning. The second, which Penny is in now, involves hyperactivity so she’s often awake for three or four hours a night. “In stage three sufferers really begin to slow down. Every child is dferent but Penny will begin to lose mobility and eventually forget how to swallow, so she’ll need a feeding tube.” Kelly and engineer Andrew, , noticed signicant changes in their daughter last October, a year after being told the grim diagnosis. Penny stopped using a fork and began using her hands to eat. She also forgot once-familiar words such as cheese, biscuits and chocolate.  Now she says “dada” and “dance” ­repeatedly. Kelly said: “She used to say ‘mummy’ but I can’t remember the last time I heard her call me that. “She has forgotten how to use toys, like a piggy bank or puzzle games and can’t put her socks and shoes on any more. Now she just looks confused. “We show her how to do it over and over and sometimes she’ll get it. “But we never knowshe’ll be able to do it again tomorrow. “She doesn’t get frustrated as she doesn’t really understand what we are ­trying to do.” Penny can still recognise her parents but they know this will not last. Kelly, of Stafford, said: “She still lights up when she sees us, so we don’t think she has forgotten us yet but we are prepared for that to happen. It’s one of our worst fears. “It takes her time to remember people she has met so I’ve made her a book with ­pictures of the family in it. I sit down and go through it with her every day. And as her -year-old brother Tyler is away at ­university we use Facetime so she remembers him. “When Penny gets to the end stage I don’t want to look back and think all I did was worry about the future. We need to embrace the now. “We took her to Disneyland Paris just before Christmas and want to go to the one in Florida next year. “She’s also desperate to meet Mr Tumble from CBeebies.” Penny’s diagnosis was doubly cruel for her parents, as she came into the world the year after her sister was stillborn, at  weeks, in March . That makes her a “rainbow baby”. Kelly said: “Having our daughter stillborn was devastating for the whole family. So I felt extremely lucky to ­discover I was ­pregnant nine months later.  “We felt so grateful to find out she was a girl too. We all fell in love with her instantly.” Kelly recalled how Penny was late in learning to crawl and speak. By the age of two she was still struggling with potty training and often had diarrhoea, which her parents later learned was symptomatic of Sanfilippo syndrome. “We hoped there was a simple reason for ­everything,” said Kelly. “But deep down we ­suspected something more was going on. “Penny behaved quite dferently from other kids her age. She didn’t look like me or Andrew or the boys. There were only a few facial similarities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner 80 insists 35 year","story":"NewsIris, : \"I cant wait to wed Egyptian toyboy,  - theres no way hes after my money\"EXCLUSIVE: Iris Jones fell for jobless Mohamed Ahmed Irbriham on Facebook and fell into his arms the first time they met.ShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video iris--i-cant-wait-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news pensioner--insists--year-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British pensioner aged  is planning to wed her -year-old Egyptian toyboy – even though she’s  years older than his mummy. Iris Jones fell for jobless Mohamed Ahmed Irbriham on Facebook and fell into his arms the first time they met. Within hours, four sexless decades were swept away on a tide of passion. After four days they tried to wed in Cairo but didn’t have the right paperwork. Now Iris is saving up to– despite opposition from her family. Feisty Iris insists Mohamed isn’t after her money nor is he seeking a passport to Britain. She says: “If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension. “I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader.“In Egypt we were quite frivolous, going out to the best restaurants all the time and we split everything  . “He’s even said he’ll sign a pre-nup because it’s me he wants – not my house. “I’ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die. I’ve always been a bit of a rebel and he’s just perfect for me.” Iris, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, tells how Mohamed greeted her when they first met at Cairo airport last November. “I was shocked by how tall he is,” she says. “He’s ft in and I’m a foot smaller but he just gave me a huge hug.”  Hours later, they became intimate and Iris adds: “It was incredible. I felt like a virgin again. It wasn’t easy but it was very loving and romantic. My ex-husband said I was frigid when we orced  years ago but I now know I’m certainly not.” She admits their first encounter came in a sleazy run-down area of Cairo – because, Iris says, respectable hotels would have frowned on their age gap. Iris lives on £-a-week pension and disability benefit. A former cleaner, she has a £, bungalow. Mohamed, meanwhile, has little savings after quitting his job when his boss refused to give him time off for Iris’s visit. But the Romeo, from Giza, insists he is not interested in Iris for material gain.  He says: “This is not about money. Money is not everything. It cannot buy you happiness. Love has no age and knows no limits. Iris and I found we understood each other well and felt the tenderness. I do not care about anyone’s opinion – only what feels good to me. “Iris is wonderful, understanding and compassionate. We share the same views about lots of things. I’m not interested in Iris’s money. I work as a quality inspector in the field of welding materials and travelled to many countries. “It is not right people look at everything through materialism. If they do, they have no feelings.”  Iris defends Mohamed, saying: “We are absolutely equal in every way. He’s not using me. If anything I’m using him because my love for him is selfish – I’m not going to let him go.” The romance has caused upset with Iris’s sons. While newlywed Steve, , has reluctantly accepted the relationship, Darren, , hasn’t. Iris says: “Steve heard Mohamed and I on the phone. He could see how well we got on, how happy he makes me. He’s a bit wary but I’m sure, given time, he will accept Mohamed as a father. “But Darren is worried Mohamed is just after my money and we had a big row which resulted in me asking him to leave the house. We have made up since, but I’ve asked him not to talk about it – I don’t want to argue.  “Mohamed’s never asked for money. I don’t have any. I’ve done a lot for my boys over the years and I want them to understand that it’s time for me to be selfish now and look after myself.” The unlikely couple “met” last summer through a Facebook page exploring atheist views. They began messaging each other and, two weeks later, Mohamed proclaimed his love and jokingly referred to her as “we”. Iris says: “I asked him, ‘What do you want an old biddy like me for  You’ve not met me, you’ve never touched my skin or looked into my eyes’. “But he told me I was a wonderful charming lady who he loved to bits. Slowly, I started to feel the same and then he sent me a picture of himself and I thought, ‘Ooh, you’re gorgeous’. “We are both Virgos. I think that’s why we get on. We are soulmates. He’s a very intelligent man and was looking for an intelligent woman. I don’t look my age and I’m fit and healthy, but it’s definitely a case of brains over beauty.”  Their physical relationship hit problems in Cairo when she fell down some stairs and spent two nights in hospital – with, Iris says, “absolute gentleman” Mohamed by her side. They then spent five days in Cairo, visiting the pyramids and taking camel and boat rides. Iris met her prospective mother-in-law – aged  – and says: “She was marvellous and glad her son had found the woman he’d been looking for. She said age was just a number. We got on like a house on fire.” Iris and Mohamed went to the British Embassy to check whether they could marry in Cairo. But she didn’t have her orce papers and they also needed a certicate of no impediment to show there was no barrier to getting married. “When they said we couldn’t get married I howled,” Iris says. “We went to see a lawyer to find out what paperwork we need. The lt was broken but Mohamed is so wonderful he carried me up four flights of stairs.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rachael bletchley one 20 british","story":"NewsopinionI hope there is a special welcome in hell for evil Holocaust deniersAnti-semitism has become a global virus while Holocaust denial is spreading and poisoning minds, writes Rachael Bletchley, as she visits Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau on the th anniversary of its liberationShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionA doctor helps a group of survivors at the entrance to the newly-liberated Auschwitz concentration camp in January  \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

I recently met a woman of  whose Polish parents come from Krakow, just  miles from Auschwitz-Birkenau. She had never even heard of the place and just looked blank when I tried to explain gas chambers, furnaces and the systematic murder of . million ­innocent souls that happened there. But at least she hadn’t already learned it was “a hoax” from one of the liars, deniers or neo-Nazis infecting social media – now the greatest propaganda machine in history.Prince Charles, speaking in Israel this week, called the Holocaust’s lessons “searingly relevant to this day”. He added: “Hatred and ­intolerance still lurk in the human heart, still tell new lies, still adopt new disguises.” Like the far-right extremists who’ve begun visiting ­former concentration camps in order to disrupt guided tours, distort facts and film themselves causing trouble. I hope there is a special welcome in hell for these evil Holocaust deniers.

She’s never had to swipe in any direction, stress over the perfect profile picture or try to boil her personality and le down to a sentence.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum renovated a derelict Victorian villa completely hidden by overgrown trees into an amazing family home - and the transformation is unbelievable. Caroline Quinn, , and husband Mark, , decided to take on the challenge of completely renovating the neglected house and barn in a village near Carlisle, Cumbria, after buying it in September  it was on the market at £, due to its state of disrepair. After the family grew out of their old home in the same village when Caroline and Mark had their third child, the mum-of-three wanted to personalise a new home to her familyaposs needs with a large open plan kitchen and upstairs laundry room. But despite an estate agent being aposwaryapos to show her the dilapidated building after scrambling through overgrown plants just to get to the front door, Caroline has now revealed her homeaposs stunning makeover, which took one year to complete. The full-time property developer said: When we were shown around the property, the estate agent opened the door a bit wary, but as soon as I stepped in and saw the spacious hallway, I knew it was our next home. It was derelict and had none of the mod-cons but had lots of original features and an old barn which was once used to keep horses. When we bought the house, we couldnapost even see it from the roadside because all the trees around it were overgrown - we had to scramble to the front door just to get in. People suggested we build a new house instead, but we wanted to keep the Victorian character then add our own personal touches. The state of it didnapost put us off - it had no plumbing or central heating, so it was a blank canvas. Being a period property with all the original features left in a good condition it was so important for us to keep it that way, so we kept the front of the house more traditional. We also had a tick list of what we wanted to put in the house, which included an open plan kitchen, a study on the ground floor, and a big family bathroom - it was really important for the rooms to be practical.  With a huge passion for interior design, Caroline and Mark put their own colourful touch in many of the rooms, the standout features being a pink door in the hallway and their neon yellow laundry room. The five-bedroomed home boasts its traditional Victorian features at the front, with the original door and brickwork, but now has a contemporary twist with a modern extension at the back and quirky cinema room and gym converted from the old barn. The couple started to work on the house straight away and the first they did was clear the outside of the overgrown shrubbery and trees, which once hid the beautul home out of sight. They decided to build the modern extension at the back of the original home, then connected it to the characterful old barn, now a luxury family cinema room, with a glazed walkway.  Caroline took to Pinterest and Instagram for decorating inspiration, but more often followed her own taste and added several bright pops of coloured paint to dferent rooms and statement furniture. The savvy saver shopped around for designer furniture on eBay to bag the best deals - managing to pick up a brand new William Holland bathtub that retailed at £, for less than £,. She said: Usually when weaposre renovating houses, we have to do it quite neutral for customers, so in every room weaposve tried to put a bit of colour in. I decided to paint part of the laundry room bright yellow - Mark said aposwhat are you on aboutapos when I first suggested it but I think itaposs just a bit of fun.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA rugby player student has told how he battered serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga and feared he had killed him. The drugged teen said he woke from a stupor to find the monster on top of him. The victim – just  at the time – had been plied with a date rape drug and was half naked. Instinct kicked in and the man, who we are calling Peter to protect his identity, laid into Sinaga – pummelling him “like a cage fighter”. Peter, a strapping ft, gave Sinaga such a beating that he feared he was dead.He said: “I thought I might have killed him, I didn’t really know what I was doing, I was using my instincts and adrenaline to survive.” The pair traded blows in two brutal exchanges before Peter escaped. Peter, supported by his mother, told the Sunday Mirror how:He was initially arrested on suspicion of GBH against Sinaga. Police did not treat him as a rape victim to begin with and didn’t carry out tests on him for  hours. He feels like an “accidental hero” after ending Sinaga’s reign of depravity. Sinaga’s crimes may not have been detected had he not accidentally left his mobile in Peter’s pocket.The rapist had spiked Peter’s drinks with GHB before abusing him in the Manchester flat where scores of other men had already fallen victim. Sinaga, , videoed the assault. Police found hundreds of similar clips on his phone and he was this month convicted of  rapes against  men aged  to .  Reliving his ordeal, Peter said: “I woke up disorientated, face down on a pillow, there was a quilt on the floor. “My pants and jeans were down to the top of my knees, he was on top of me with his pants down to his ankles. “As I turned my head he jumped up and ran out of the bedroom. I pulled my pants up, did my belt up, I was still confused. I had no clue where I was. “A couple of minutes afterwards, he came back in fully dressed. “I said, ‘Mate, what’s happened ’ He started shouting, ‘Intruder! Intruder!’ I said, ‘Mate, calm down’, then he headbutts me on my nose and starts biting me. “I was so confused. We were grappling. He pulled me over on to the bed and bit my shoulder.He was a scrawny little guy. I was defending myself. I was stronger, I hit him a few times and he dropped to the floor. “I had his white phone in my pocket. I’ve no idea how it got there. My phone, driving licence and wallet were in the bathroom. I picked them up, still disorientated. “I was feeling scared, I knew I was in Manchester but that was about it.”  Peter said that as he tried to leave Sinaga jumped on his back. He went on: “I managed to get him off me, I started hitting him. I was over him like you see in UFC. It was like a big blur.When I stopped there was a lot of blood on him and me. He was on the floor not moving. I’d had scuffles playing rugby, but nothing like that.” Once free, Peter called his mum to pick him up. Then a neighbour of Sinaga gave him shelter.Peter said: “I called  and said, ‘I think I’ve been raped’. Then I thought he could be dead because of the amount of force I used.” Police told Peter’s mum to take him to Longsight station. En route, Peter told her: “Mum, I think I’ve killed him.” By the time they reached the station police were at Sinaga’s flat. A second nightmare was about to unfold – as Peter was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.  Peter, who had been out celebrating his A-level results that night, explained: “Over the radio I heard them say they’d found him, then they said, ‘He’s not looking good’. “I didn’t feel worried because I’d done nothing wrong. They took my clothes and bagged them. They took pictures of the bite marks on my belly and back and my nose and knuckles. “They took my fingerprints and DNA. They questioned me like an offender, not a victim. He was in hospital and they told me they would question him when he was released. “I repeatedly said, ‘I think he’s tried to rape me’ but they didn’t do any tests. That’s the one thing I thought wasn’t right at the time.  “They askedI was straight or gay, I said I was straight. They asked had I used Grindr  Was it a date  “Had something gone wrong  I felt like they didn’t act on my complaint straight away.” Peter was held until pm before being released on bail. He added: “I thought they should have checked both sides. It was more like they were prosecuting me.” ordeal Peter told police he feared he had been raped at .am on June , . Swabs were taken at am on June . Peter’s ordeal had begun after he became separated from friends on a trip to Factory nightclub, Manchester. Sinaga spotted him and saw his chance. Peter said: “He offered for me to come to his flat because it was cold. “I am happy to chat to anyone. I said yes and I remember walking to his apartment.There was a kitchen area, but he took me into the bedroom and said he’d get me a few drinks.There were five or six bottles of spirits on a table. He poured a clear drink, I thought it was vodka or sambuca. “I felt comfortable, I thought he was around my age. He never once said he was gay.”  Peter told how Sinaga gave him two drinks. He said: “After the second I was dizzy, all over the place. “Last thing I remember was feeling sick and him saying, ‘You’re not in a good state to go outside’.I felt like I was really, really drunk, paralytic. I was seeing four or five of everything. “I didn’t want to pass out in this guy’s house, I wanted to call my friends or my mum to pick me up. I asked him for my phone, but he was saying, ‘No, you need to sit down’.He was calm and caring, like someone looking after a drunk friend.I blamed myself for mixing beer, spirits and shots. After that I have no memory until am, around four hours.” That was when Peter woke – and all hell broke loose. Bloodied Sinaga was treated in hospital for a suspected brain bleed.Police later discovered the rape footage on his phone – and hundreds of other videos led to police tracing more victims. Sinaga kept victims’ phones, business cards and passports as souvenirs. Forty-eight men gave evidence in four trials at Manchester Crown Court and he was sentenced to  years."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather sunny spells across","story":"NewsUK Weather: Sunny spells across Britain before snow and hail to hit with icy blastA band of sunny rain will sweep in from the west until it brings snow and hail in northern England and Scotland with temperatures plunging to -CShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JAN NewsSunny spell is expected to hit tomorrow as a band of rain moves across easterly \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

White Maltichon Henry was out  with his -year-old owner when they were both caught up in the attack in in North Lanarkshire, Scotland on Thursday evening. The owner, who has not been named, suffered a minor injury after a bullet grazed her hand. Three thugs, armed with guns and knives, were targeting Marc McDermott, who was shot in the backside.Armed police raced to the scene just after pm and later found the attackers’ getaway car burned out nearby, reports the Daily Record.It’s understood McDermott had just parked a x car outside a family member’s house in the street before being pounced on by the gang as he got out.  Three masked men chased Mr McDermott before shooting him in the middle of an expensive housing estate in Cumbernauld. McDermott, , was being treated in hospital yesterday, where his condition was described as non-le threatening. The area was cordoned off for several hours yesterday as police carried out forensic searches nearby. A White Nissan Naa x was later seen being towed away by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Gillian Grant, senior investigating officer, said: “This was completely reckless and the fact this happened in a residential street shows the suspects had a complete disregard for the safety of the public. “A woman who was simply walking her dog has been left absolutely devastated. “There is an increased police presence in the area and reassurance patrols will be carried out. A team of detectives will be conducting CCTV and house-to-house inquiries.  “I would appeal to the public to contact us with any relevant information about this attack because this behaviour cannot be allowed to happen in our communities. “I would ask specicallyanyone witnessed the attack or saw a silver Ford Focus shortly before or after the incident to contact us. Also, I appeal to anyone driving in the Eastfield Road and Dullater Road area last night at about .pm to check dash cam footage and contact us.” The DCI said she could not confirm how the female victim suffered an injury to her hand, saying she had been “caught up” in the incident.  She was not with McDermott before the attack unfolded. Forensics carried out finger-tip searches in bushes at the scene yesterday while detectives carried out door-to-door inquiries.

Professional kite surfer Lonia Haeger was on a road trip with two friends when they found themselves in a dangerous situation as freezing rain made the road they were on completely impassable. The trio were terried of being hit by another car or sliding down the mountain, but then they had the ingenious idea to use Tinder to save their lives.Posting about the experience on Instagram, Lonia wrote: After driving three days through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway we made it to our first destination! The North Cape. The most northern point of Europe.She added: What a wonderful rough landscape.

The city,  miles from virus epicentre Wuhan, has also shut down its cinemas in a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly illness, according to Bangkok Post.The disease has killed  people in China, with experts believing that number could continue to rise. Year of the Rat celebrations are also being cancelled around the country due to fears that gatherings of large crowds could help the virus spread at an alarming rate. The Lunar New Year is the countryaposs biggest holiday, and a time when many people would travel to visit family. Today, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam declared a virus emergency in the Asian financial hub, announcing several measures to limit the cityaposs links with mainland China. Schools, already closed for the holiday, will now remain shut until February , while inbound and outbound flights and high speed rail trips between Hong Kong and Wuhan have been halted. Lam said confirmed that all official visits to the mainland and official Lunar New Year celebrations would be scrapped immediately.She also said she had sought the assistance from Chinaaposs State Council to ensure on-going mask supplies were adequate. They may also ask universities to extend holidays too. Lamaposs statements came hours after she ed from the World Economic Forum in Davos and amid broader tensions as her team grapples with at times violent anti-government protests that have rumbled on for seven months. I hereby urge all citizens stay united to fight against the epidemic to protect all Hong Kong peopleaposs health and safety, Lam said. She added that it would be impractical to shut down all border crossings with the mainland. Some protesters have railed against growing interference from Beijing seeking to curb the cityaposs freedoms while others have expressed fear over greater integration with the mainland. The cityaposs health authorities have confirmed  coronavirus cases, all linked to Wuhan, where the virus first appeared, with a further  people being treated as suspected of having the disease. The first case was confirmed on Wednesday, a -year-old man visiting from Wuhan who crossed by high-speed rail from neighbouring Shenzhen.The condition of one of the people confirmed with the virus deteriorated on Saturday and the patient was now on a respirator, Hong Kongaposs government funded broadcaster RTHK reported.Hong Kong earlier deployed temperature screening equipment at the airport and the high-speed rail station. Air passengers are required to fill in health declaration forms while isolation wards have been set-up in hospitals.Reuters witnesses have described the widespread use of masks in offices and on public transport, a reflection of the cityaposs strong memories of an earlier coronavirus crisis.

The sea boils red as one of the highly intelligent mammals is ­battered against rocks as it tries to escape. If the striped dolphin is “lucky” it will end up at a hotel resort where thousands of holiday ­makers, including Britons, will pay to swim with the creatures or watch them perform tricks. They are sold on by fishermen to “brokers” and can eventually fetch up to £, each once they are trained. But many of the dolphin’s ­companions rounded up at Taiji cove in Japan are immediately slaughtered and sold for meat. Travel giant TUI are believed to be the only British major travel agent still offering “dolphin ­experience” holidays to Brits – although the company insists they endorse only venues that uphold global animal welfare standards. It is estimated , dolphins will be captured in Japan’s “Killing Cove” this season. Tim Burns, campaign manager of The Dolphin Project which filmed the latest gruesome ­round-up, said: “The mortality rate is extremely high and the start of  has been bloody. “Holidaymakers who go to ‘swim with’ programmes have an idea that the dolphin was gently picked up off the coast and is thankful and happy to be in ­captivity. But the process in which they snatched is merciless. “Tourists are largely unaware how many creatures have died so they can swim with that one ­dolphin they meet. “We believe that for every , sea mammals captured, around  end up in captivity. The rest are killed for meat.” In the last week alone  ­mammals were captured and  were slain for meat, according to the group, which used a drone and clftop cameras. Hunters drive them into the ­shallows by lowering steel poles into the water and ­hitting the poles with hammers. The highly sensitive dolphins swim towards shore to escape the noise, only to be trapped by nets.  Those not wanted for training are slaughtered on land with a metal spike pushed into their neck – ­hidden behind tarpaulin sheets. Tim said: “These highly intelligent animals understand not only pain but the idea of dying. And they mourn the death of others.”TUI plugs the Atlantis Sanya resort in China which admitted buying from Taiji hunters in . The resort invites customers to “meet and interact with the ­dolphins while professional ­photographers capture this ­unforgettable moment”.  TUI customers can book ­online for a £-a-night stay at the five-star hotel. Rivals STA Travel, AirBnB and Virgin Holidays ­said they would cut ties two years ago. The British-based campaign group Dolphin Freedom UK is ­calling for TUI to sever ­connections with the dolphin entertainment business. It has collected , ­signatures for a petition and has ­organised a series of protests outside branches. The charity says le ­expectancy for dolphins bred in captivity is around  years compared with ­between  and  in the wild.  Marine parks in China, Japan and the Middle East are the biggest customers for the creatures. The trade, which has been ­going on since , is legal in Japan under their fishing laws. TUI also ­promotes firms Dolphin Discovery – based in central America and US – and SeaWorld in the US, both of which deny buying dolphins from Taiji hunts.  A TUI spokesman said: “We are committed to working only with ­venues that agree to uphold the Global Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism as ­formulated by the Association of British Travel Agents. The venues we feature are ­subject to an ­extensive and ­independent animal welfare audit ­programme to ­ensure they are ­upholding global ­animal welfare ­standards. We are in discussions with the venues to ­further improve animal welfare and ­address the issues.” Kerzner International, which owns the Sanya hotel, admitted buying  dolphins from Japan in  but insisted they are in good health and it would not support future collections from the wild.

Meanwhile the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, has busied itself trying to convince taxpayers to raise £, in order to make the currently out of commission Big Ben ring again on #Brexit Day#.But what about ordinary Dundonians on the street – have punters really been that worried about the upcoming split “I’ve done no preparation at all,” said Val King, an admin assistant from Forfar.“It has come round quite quickly. I think everyone will be much the same they’ve been busy with Christmas, and this has just been ongoing the whole time.“You’ve had this thing about Big Ben, which has been absolutely ridiculous. What a waste of money.“You only have to look around and see how many people there are on the streets to know the money could be better spent.”Alex Simpson, , an art student at DJCAD, said: “I wasn’t old enough to vote at the time of the vote so people my age didn’t get a chance to have a say.“It’ll just be a case of seeing what happens. I don’t think anyone can really believe it’s happening though.“I really don’t think it will make much dference to people’s day-to-day lives, they’ll still get up and go about their day the same.”Monica Anderson, a retired council worker from Dundee, admits she’s still uncertain as to whether Brexit will actually take place.But she is hopeful it does – even though she was a remain voter in .Monica said: “I’m still waiting on it actually happening. I’m still doubtful it will actually happen because it has dragged on so long – but I would like to see it happen.“I voted remain before, but I don’t want Scotland to become independent from the UK so I would like to see Brexit happen.“I don’t think we should held hostage by politicians in Brussels. If there was another vote I would vote leave again.“I would say people are fed up – by now it is either going to happen or it’s not.”Sandy Robertson, , a former jute factory worker from Forfar, was less optimistic – and thinks leaving the EU is a mistake.He said: “I still think we should remain. Things should just be left the way they are. I think the English voters made a mistake when they voted to leave and we’re just having to put up with it.“It wasn’t Scottish voters who voted to leave.“I think there were a lot of people in the farming and fishing industries who influenced people to vote leave as well.“It’s just been a big mess that we’ve been dragged into against our will.”Earlier this month city councillors approved the latest recommendations put forward by officers to prepare Dundee  for Brexit.In his report before the council’s policy and resources committee, chief executive David Martin warned that Brexit continued to hold “signicant financial and operational risks” for the council.He wrote: “Both the Cross Party European Group and the officers’ Brexit Advisory Team have continued to meet regularly to consider the risks facing the council and the city in order to make any preparations possible.“Staff in frontline services across the council, including libraries and community centres, as well across our community planning partners, have been briefed and given a handout to support and signpost citizens.“In addition, we have worked with Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce to promote the scheme to their members and ensured welfare rights advice services across the city are briefed.#He said that the chamber had also recruited additional staff resources to support export documentation and to assist in wider preparedness work.In addition to that, elected members had been given information in case constituents raised queries via their surgeries.Mr Martin said: “Dundee’s Central Library is a location for the Assisted Digital Scheme for those needing help to make online applications, and we are also publicising the assistance available locally from the Citizens Advice Bureau.“The Children and Families Service and the Health and Social Care Partnership have been made aware of responsibilities for applications on behalf of looked after children and vulnerable adults.”He said that the impact on servicesthe council#s workforce was reduced as EU nationals left the country was low.  but that the authority had sought to re-assure those affected that we want them and their families to stay, and to signpost them to information and support.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e2ab665786043.48396401.jpg ","title":"callachan aiming to end below par east end record with dark blues","story":"East End Park is a venue Ross Callachan is no stranger to.In his six years in the Raith Rovers first-team, he took part in the Fe derby four times, twice in Dunfermline.On neither occasion, however, was the -year-old able to end up on the winning side.But Callachan is hoping to change all that tonight when he heads there as a Dundee player after joining on loan until the end of the season from St Johnstone last week.The Pars are on a poor run of form themselves, losing their last five in the league.However, Callachan insists that counts for nothing and all the Dark Blues can focus on is doing what’s required to earn all three points after the disappointment of exiting the cup to Motherwell in his debut last weekend.“I’ve played them a few times home and away but it’s always tough going to East End,” he said.“They’ll be looking to win, losing their last five games, so I think it’s a must-win for both teams.“It was disappointing to be out of the cup but at least we can focus on the league now.“We have  games left until the end of the season so, hopefully, we can go and push for the play-offs.”Callachan is realistic, however, and knows the pitfalls of the Championship from his time at Raith.With just four points separating Dundee in fourth and the Fers in fth, he hopes to draw on all his experience to help the Dee in this one and every game after.“It’s very tough. I think in this league teams can be inconsistent and, probably, Dundee have been like that themselves throughout this season,” he added.“Hopefully, I can come and help that. I’ve been in the league before with Raith and in the play-offs, too. I’ve been there and done it all before.”Although keen to kick on and help the Dark Blues this term, Callachan is just happy to be playing again after enduring a long spell out of the team at Saints.He only made four appearances for the Perth men this season, the last coming in September, and is enjoying feeling wanted again.“I’m hungry to play, do well and help the team,” he said defiantly.“I want to get games under my belt because it was frustrating at St Johnstone.“You’re sitting in the stands and you feel you can help the team but the manager thought otherwise.“I’m just happy somebody wants me here and I feel like I’ve fitted in right away.“Hopefully, I can go and play and show what I can do.“The initial attraction was Dundee were interested in me. My head was turned right away.“Obviously, not playing at St Johnstone made me want to come here.“The plan is to help the club get to where it wants to be, back in the Premiership.“We’re in the play-off spots now so, hopefully, we push and climb up to second.“Dundee United are going to win the league so the main thing for us is getting to the play-offs and going up that way.“We want to finish as high as possible.”Playing alongside and learning from quality players like Graham Dorrans is another reason why Callachan was happy to make the switch up the A, across Tayside.And he was delighted to see his team-mate sign a new deal this week.“He’s, obviously, played at a right high level and you can tell he’s a good player who can help the team.“Him signing a new deal can only be good for us.“It’s good for everyone we have that competition.“It’s good for the club and for the boys, competition is always good.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19798931-897x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 2 hibs appere solo goal earns united cup replay","story":"Louis Appere earned Dundee United a Scottish Cup fourth-round replay as they twice came from behind to draw with Hibs.Christian Doidge gave the Hibees a dream start after eight minutes at Tannadice before Lawrence Shankland scored a classy equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Martin Boyle put the visitors back in front with a powerful drive on  minutes before substitute Appere curled home a leveller on  minutes which earned the Terrors an Easter Road replay and a place in the hat for the last- draw.United showed five changes from the team which faced Partick last weekend with Jamie Robson, Calum Butcher, Ian Harkes, Peter Pawlett and Paul McMullan coming in for Adrian Sporle, Declan Glass, Nicky Clark, Louis Appere and Mark Reynolds.It was Pawlett#s first start for almost three months, with McMullan and Harkes seeing their first action since the last Dundee derby.What had been billed as the tie of the round got off to a frenetic start. And it was the visitors who almost took the lead after three minutes. However, Mark Connolly was in the right place at the right time to clear Florian Kamberi#s effort off the line.Hibs weren#t to be denied five minutes later, though, as they opened the scoring through a low Doidge effort.

Boyle was again the creator-in-chief, with his surging run into the Terrors# half leaving United back pedalling before Melker Hallberg saw his shot foiled by Siegrist.Kamberi again fired towards his fellow-countryman just before the half-hour but this time it was an easy save for United#s Swiss stopper.The Tangerines were struggling to get a foothold in the match and had created few chances as proceedings approached the half-way point. When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":null,"title":"graham dorrans signs new 18 month contract at dundee","story":"Graham Dorrans has signed a new -month contract at Dundee.The -year-old midfielder originally joined the Dark Blues from Rangers in September on a deal until the end of the season.Dorrans had been linked with a move to English side MK Dons earlier in the January transfer window.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

If it gets voted through, city chiefs will draw up an action plan to achieve the one million tree target in urban Edinburgh.This will include tree planting opportunities on both public and private land, via new developments and by replacing trees lost to age, disease and damage.Meanwhile, a new forum made up of representatives from a wide range of organisations will seek to find ways of planting more trees, more quickly.Representation will be invited from groups such as the Edinburgh and Lothians Greenspace Trust, the Woodland Trust, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Trees of Edinburgh, the Scottish Wildle Trust, the Trust for Conservation Volunteers and the Edinburgh Living Landscape Initiative.Annual tree-planting targets will also be set, with the overall number of trees publicly reported on an on-going basis.

You loved the movies. You werenrsquot fussy. At some point Irsquod have kissed you and told you I loved you, like I did every other day.But not this birthday. Not this year. For the first time since  I wonrsquot be able to do any of that.Ah, Jeanie.My we Jean died on October  last year at .am in Strathcarron Hospice. Outside, birds were singing.Shersquod been in the hospice for a couple of days. On the Thursday it had reached the point where I was no longer able to look after her properly at home.I had spent the Friday night trying to sleep in a chair beside her bed. Every so often Irsquod lean over and talk to her as she slept, letting her know I was there. Or so I hoped. The voice gets through, one of the hospice nurses had told me.Just after eight her breathing changed. It began to slow and slow as I held her hand and cried. And then it stopped.Such a strangely peaceful thing, I remember thinking in between the tears. Nothing traumatic. Just a sht into stillness.An ending, one that had been waiting for us since she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in .Shards of memory from that morning keep coming back to me. They still cut me open. The face of the nurse I spoke to earlier that morning as the enormity of what was ahead of me was finally sinking in the same nurse who came through the door  minutes later when Jean stopped breathing. The drive down the hill to Denny knowing that I had to tell Jeanrsquos mother and sisters, our daughters, what had happened.And then the drive back. The final moments we spent with her, all the words we didnrsquot get to sayunspoken.I am writing this three-and-a-half months later. No time at all. An eternity.Most mornings I reach across the bed to where she should be, where she isnrsquot. I go through each day knowing that the person I have loved most in this world is no longer in it.I want to hear her say my name one last time. I have been trying to remember the last time she did. Somewhere in the couple of weeks before she died, I guess, before illness took language away from her. A last time that I didnrsquot realise would be the last.The thing I struggle to get my head around is the way she is somehow everywhere and nowhere now. Every road I drive down, every song I hear on the radio, she is in them. Everything is a trigger, everything points to once-insignicant memories now charged and potent, small moments from the past suddenly weighed down with an impossible weight of loss and longing.I have nothing original or unique to say about grief. Irsquom sorry. No eloquence, no insight. Mostly itrsquos a drudge illuminated by spikes of pain.The truth is, I suspect Irsquom still only in the foothills anyway. I cry most days. Sometimes I prompt it deliberately bring her to mind in a way I know will hurt, like sticking a needle into an open wound, just to remind myself that Irsquom feeling something.Other times I try to distract myself. Football on the radio, bad movies on the telly, books that seem a safe distance from her memory.But griefrsquos a sneaky f***er. Last week I was reading a passage in a book about starfish. My subconscious made the connection for me. From starfish I thought of the word seahorse and suddenly I remembered Jeaniersquos tattoo, little black ribbons and bars of ink in the shape of a cartoon-cute seahorse.And, in the same moment, I realised that I hadnrsquot thought about it since she died. How was that even possible  Was it on her left arm or her right arm  Suddenly I wasnrsquot sure. was the cruellest year. On the last day of  we were told we had run out of treatments. In May we were told Jeanie had, at best, a few months. Before we left, I remember, her oncologist gave her a hug.How did we get through the rest of that day  Itrsquos a blank to me now.Weeks passed. Irsquod repeat my mantra to her most days. ldquoYoursquore okay today, so things are okay. I was in a state of deep denial. Jeanie knew better.By July and August it was clear that her illness was beginning to have a real impact. She began to lose memory and speech. It seemed a final cruel punishment for someone so articulate, so engaged with the world. The last weeks were marked by her slow withdrawal from all of us, a withdrawal that became final on that October morning.Three-and-a-half months ago. No time at all. An eternity.ldquoNo tenses any more, the poet Denise Riley writes in Time Lived, Without its Flow, her essay about grief in the wake of the sudden death of her son. ldquoHis sudden death has dropped like a guillotine blade to slice through my old expectation that my days would stream onwards into my coming le. Instead, I continue to sense my daily le as paper-thin. As it is. But this cut through any usual feeling of chronology leaves a great blankness ahead.No tenses any more. In truth, we both had been living in a continuous present for years, ever since Jean was first diagnosed. The first mention of the word cancer cut away the notion of a future.She was diagnosed in the autumn. ldquoIrsquoll not see Christmas, she told me then. We saw another . But even so the future, or the idea of it at least, had been taken from us, even as we grew older and watched our kids grow up.Worse, the past had been taken from us as well. It was too painful for her to think about. Even everyday intimacies and nothing-special moments were out of bounds. We had the present and nothing . And now I donrsquot even have that. I am already living in that great blankness that Riley talks about.That said, maybe I have the past again. I can revisit it. And I do.Most days I find myself fantasising about going back in time, inserting myself into a moment we once shared. It doesnrsquot have to be anything special. Just as long as we are together, where I can hear her voice, where I can see her face, where I can touch her arm, her cheek, know that she is there with me. Given the choice right now, I would live forever in that moment. Reliving it again and again.In some ways I already am. Just before Christmas I had our wedding video transferred to DVD so I could watch it. I donrsquot think I had ever watched it before,Irsquom honest. Now I canrsquot stop.Itrsquos not really a wedding video, just some footage my friend Mark filmed that day back in . Watching it again took me back to our old flat in Bruce Street, Stirling. There are our two cats, my sister-in-law looking impossibly young, my dad, Jeaniersquos dad, now no longer with us. And here are friends who have drted out of our lives.But, really, when I watch it, Irsquom only watching Jeanie. She would have been  when it was filmed. God, she looks beautul. She had her make-up done professionally that morning and she hated it. And yet on video itrsquos clear how great it looks on her.She hated being filmed. It explains why she hardly says anything in the video. That was not like her at all. I wish she had said more on camera, just so I can hear her speak. But the fact that she is there is enough, occupying a space in this world, a grainy image of her physical presence that is now out of touch.Already there is a moment in the video I find myself waiting for every time I put it on. At one point she comes through the swing doors that separated our kitchenette from the living room and, as the camera adjusts to the March light streaming through the window, itrsquos clear she is smoking. Jeanie is smoking.I had almost forgotten. How could I have forgotten  It had been something she had done as long as Irsquod known her.She would give it up a year, maybe  months, later with the same steely self-will she later brought to learning to play guitar or speak Esperanto. A task to be achieved.But in the fuzzy, flickering yellow video light, the image rolling and glitchy with age, she can be seen drawing fumes into her lungs with such obvious pleasure that the sight of it felt like a depth charge in my head, a memory of who she once was, of the girl I first met in a student kitchen in Stirling University in September . We were both  then. She was barefooted and wearing a headscarf because her hairdresser had given her a buzzcut, much to her disgust.She sat there smoking and swearing and talking. She was this leforce. I donrsquot know how  to describe her. She was self-confident and outgoing, all the things I wasnrsquot. I was totally smitten. What she saw in me, I still donrsquot know.In time I realised that we had some things in common. We were both working-class kids in a still largely middle-class environment. She had her own vulnerabilities like everyone . Irsquom not sure what I represented to her, but I was happy to represent something, anything.I asked her out. In the most roundabout of ways. And she said no. And then she said yes. And that was the start of the rest of our lives. We got together, stayed together, grew up, got married, had kids, were happy.In my head there are all these dferent versions of Jeanie the -year-old firebrand, the thirtysomething mother, the dedicated professional , the girl who would get drunk with her dad and her sisters every Hogmanay and start singing Leaving on a Jet Plane. The Jeanie who immersed herself in anything that interested her. The Jeanie who could make you laugh just by the way she looked at you.For a few days after her death I found myself resentful about the last incarnation of Jeanie, the one who increasingly was drting away from us, the one I had been caring for in the last weeks of her le. I loved that version too, of course, but the memory of this last Jeanie was so close, so tight against me, that I couldnrsquot see past her to all the others Irsquod spent the best part of  years with.It took my friends Karina and Michael to put me right. Jean and I had met Karina for a coffee in September just before Karina went back to Buenos Aires to look after her own sick mother. It was a farewell meeting. We all knew it.A few weeks later, after Jeanrsquos funeral, Michael told me what Karina had told him about that day, about how, when I was off where for a few moments, Jeanie had told her that she knew what was happening to her and that she was at peace with it.Hearing that felt like a damn breaking inside me. My viewpoint shted  degrees. Suddenly it came home to me how stoical that last version of Jeanie was, how brave. When she was initially diagnosed in , she had struggled to deal with it. But when it ed in  she refused to give into despair. All she wanted, she said, was to see the end of Game of Thrones. She managed that at least.The thing is she wouldnrsquot want you to know any of this. Jeanie was intensely private. She hated me mentioning her in anything I wrote. And this illness. Well, this was her business. But I guess itrsquos my business now. And what is this business  That Irsquom not sure I know. I do know that over and above losing her Ihave somehow also lost my own sense of self. I was so synced to Jeanie that I am now unfixed, ungrounded. What Irsquove realised in this no time eternity that Irsquom currently living in, is I donrsquot really know what Irsquom for any more.I am still a father and a son and a brother and brother-in-law and a friend . But I navigated through the world with Jean as my lodestar. And now that star has disappeared, and the night is dark.I donrsquot believe in heaven but I have taken to thinking about the possibility of parallel universes. I like the idea that somewhere there is another Jeanie even now. In most of them I guess she would never have met me. Or maybe she met me and didnrsquot like me, or vice versa . But I want to believe she is out there. Somewhere, I hope, Jeanie is smoking a cigarette and enjoying it as much as she does in our wedding video.In the week after Jeanrsquos death we put a notice in the Falkirk Herald. The Philip Larkin line from his poem An Arundel Tomb seemed appropriate: ldquoWhat will survive of us is love. It comes at the end of a poem in which Larkin is trying to suggest otherwise. But I want it to be true.Yesterday would have been your birthday, Jeanie. What survives of you is love. Thatrsquos why this hurts so much. Smoke one for me, darling.If you would like to donate to the Strathcarron Hospice, please visit Jean Jamiesonrsquos In Memory page at www.strathcarronhospice.net inmemoryof jean-jamieson"},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"RUM doings at Michelle Ballantynersquos launch for the Scottish Tory leadership.

One woman real, the other a beautully drawn imaginary portrait.Laying down the books what stayed with me was the essence, the spirit of both, and the feeling that one had grasped the mood of both countries.I know one country well, the other not at all. I know France well, or so I think, and certainly have grasped both history and mood all the more for living here.When I write about two of the three countries mentioned, I do so with the confidence of close contact of stories told and remembered of links forged republic to republic.I do the same with England and Scotland although I havenrsquot set foot in either for years. But I lived and worked in both. I switched listening modes from London to Glasgow as easily as switching TV channels and in Scotland reported on and witnessed a country rapidly evolving, gathering within it a fresh pride, a steely core to rid itself of dependence on Westminster.

That is not the truth but there is a truth contained within it.What irritates me above all in most of these comment pieces coming from over the Border, is absence, awareness. Absence of any attempt to delve under the demands to seek the almost indefinable ndash the spirit of a people.Any reading of history shows that movements grow slowly until suddenly, like a high tide, they gather and form until the point they are unstoppable.Sometimes though the expected tide doesnrsquot reach its watermark and flops against the bulwarks ndash becalmed, almost shocked at its sudden halt.If not careful, the Independence movement could reach that point and make no mistake, nothing is being spared by the Westminster Opposition to ensure it does.Confidence can be chipped away statistics twisted to enable doubt to take seed groups encouraged to agitate from within with public spats that only increase the nervousness of those unsure and uncertainthey want to leave the familiar.Cynicism in these times is good ndash but not too much. Passion is good ndash but must be controlled. Anger is good ndash but swallow pride and turn it outwards not back into the group.Much is made of Irelandrsquos struggle for independence and its success on the European stage. Some believe a whole nation rose up. In fact, the Easter rising was begun by a handful, ridiculed by Dubliners as they marched to the Four Courts.Captured, they could have gone down as yet another minor episode.

This has transformed the act of placing a bet on a sporting outcome.:Brian Rice case highlight how approach to gambling in Scottish football has to be revisitedPreviously, the issues associated with addiction and problem gambling were unintended and unsought. Irsquom not saying here you could ever have characterised this industry by its empathy for the flawed human condition. Once, there had been a degree of humanity though, where checks and balances might be provided simply by visiting a bookmakers and interacting with friends and neighbours.Now, billions are spent by the online gambling industry to ensure that addiction isnrsquot an unfortunate consequence but a desired outcome. And professional football, the most popular sport in the world, is where the lowest-hanging fruit is to be found.This week, Brian Rice, the respected manager of Hamilton Academical FC, became the latest high-profile football person to admit that he has been struggling with gambling addiction for most of his adult le.His story is only the latest in a long litany of human tragedies associated with football and gambling.Almost immediately the football tribe ndash managers, players and journalists ndash threw a protective cordon around him and praised Mr Rice for his dignity and courage in going public with his ordeal. Predictably, they strove to absolve the football authorities and our major clubs from any blame that might have attached to them owing to their lucrative association with online gambling.Some of their arguments were reasonable.After all, much of the sponsorship cash can be spent on developing young players and supporting nearby health and wellbeing initiatives in local communities.This though, is a bit like saying thatyou swim with sharks it can give you a greaterappreciation of their natural environment.  There is a reason why the predatory giants of the online gambling industry have targeted professional football. In no other sphere of human endeavour do so many working-class people gather in such huge numbers at regular intervals.According to recently reported research the industry is using third-party companies to collect personal data and thus enable online casinos to target low-income customers and ex-gamblers. One former digital marketing specialist in the industry said: ldquoThird-party data providers allowed us to target their email lists with precision. Lower-income users were among the most successfully targeted segments.The eye-watering profits accruing from gambling allow operators to use every artice and lever at their disposal to ensure they are ring-fenced.

These politicians were later revealed to have received expensive gts and hospitality from the betting industry.:Neil Cameron: Brian Rice case nothing to do with hypocrisySo vast and pernicious is the influence of the gambling lobby that in , the former Sports Minister, Tracey Crouch, was forced to admit defeat. She resigned after the government refused to back down on the timetable for reducing the maximum stake on FOBMs. She had wanted the change to be made earlier than the planned date of October . Yet senior colleagues ignored her even when she said that the delay could lead to hundreds of people killing themselves because of gambling addiction linked to these machines.Ms Crouch wasnrsquot indulging in emotional hyperbole here. In , research published in the journal Neuron, found that gambling makes people susceptible to depression and anxiety by altering the brainrsquos physical structure. Previous research had consistently found links associating gambling with debt, family breakdown and a suite of mental health issues.The new research though, found thatthese affective disorders diminish the capacity to tolerate economic risk.The online behemoths prey on menwhen they are at their most vulnerable. This is when they are watching live football and drinking.Their smartphone devices are weaponised by the online companies to extract as much money as possible from them in the two-hour window available to them.Odds are offered on every twist and turn of the action by a bewildering array of online products that bookend the televised pictures and analysis. The Gambling Commission recently fined a major online firm poundm after it missed more than  incidents indicating behaviour associated with a problem gambler. On one occasion the gambler immediately re-staked substantial winnings, suggesting this was either a money-laundering operation or an affluent addict. Yet this occurs much more often further down the financial scale but escapes scrutiny owing to the smaller sums.The football authorities which solicit these firms and the clubs who prostitute themselves to them are just as culpable in spreading the disease of gambling addiction. They are knowingly giving licence to these companies to destroy the lives of their most vulnerable and disadvantaged supporters.My own team, Celtic, have won more trophies than I could ever have hoped for during my letime. Yet I would gladly trade all of them to redeem the le of one person and their family ruined by addiction to gambling.

And, it transpires, a little more prevalent than had previously been thought.A pound. million programme carried out by Nevis Landscape Partnership involving  separate projects on Ben Nevis and the surrounding glen has just reached its conclusion.Over its five-year lespan, it has seen , trees raised from seed by children and planted in Glen Nevis to help to replace trees lost to deer, disease and the elements, and a new accessible path created at the foot of the mountain. It has also seen art, education and community engagement projects which have boosted understanding of the mountainrsquos unique habitat and history.And for the , visitors who every year trek the Benrsquos well-worn km path, loose, broken and lost stones have been replaced ndash making it a far less risky experience.But perhaps the most challenging ndash and revealing ndash project was the one that combined the efforts of  botanists, geologists and mountain guides in a painstaking and sometimes daredevil search for some of the tiniest inhabitants of Britainrsquos tallest peak.The North Face Survey took scientists roped to mountain guides for safety to some of the Benrsquos most challenging corries, gullies and scree-covered slopes, in a ldquoneedle in a haystack search for tiny specks of plant le.Perhaps remarkably for a mountain which has towered over Scottish le for thousands of years, the survey ventured into areas never previously explored by scientists.As well as shedding fresh light on the extent of the mountainrsquos fascinating plant le ndash leading to Scottish Natural Heritage to upgrade conditions from ldquounfavourable to ldquofavourable ndash the survey forged a remarkable appreciation between the climbers, botanists and geologists for the mountain, and helped ensure one of its best-loved gullies would remain accessible to climbers.According to Mike Pescod, a mountain guide and chair of Nevis Landscape Partnership, a key element of the project was to assess whether rare flowers in number four gully were adversely affected by climbers ndash an issue which raised fears that climbing in the area might be curbed to help ensure fragile plantsrsquo survival.ldquoWhen we were introduced to the botanists they alluded to ice axe-wielding climbers who ripped out plants, he recalled. ldquoBut after three years of working together, it was clear we shared a passion and enthusiasm for the place, landscape and the plants.Better still, their labours were rewarded with a series of remarkable results.Before the survey, only around  populations of its target species of alpine plants were thought to survive the harsh conditions of the North Face.However, the survey identied more than , including fresh sites for some of our rarest alpine plants.They include tufted saxrage, with its small, jagged leaves that measure only -mm and tiny white flowers with pale green veins to attract passing butterflies and flies, generally found nestling amid scree and rock clefts. And also exceedingly rare wavy meadow-grass ndash Poa flexuosa ndash classed as ldquovulnerable and found in only a few locations across the country.Perhaps most unexpected, however, was the discovery of two species of plants not previously found on the Ben: alpine saxrage, with deceivingly resilient flowers and more commonly found in Iceland, Greenland and Norway and curved woodrush, a short, grassy herb found on windswept, rocky summits and plateaus.There were flashes of colour found in the harshest and hardest locations: emerald green leaves and deep red catkins of female dwarf willows were discovered nestling amid the granite of Tower Ridge, involving a heart-pumping scramble and rock climb to reach.Alpine ladyrsquos mantle, drooping saxrage and fresh populations of white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear were also recorded ndash unfortunately, some at higher altitudes than expected, hinting at a movement uphill in search of colder climes.As well as noting the plantsrsquo locations, details of their health and size were recorded to provide a baseline for future botanical surveys.Alongside the scale of finding and documenting tiny plants across a vast area, botanists and climbers faced dficult terrain and complex logistical challenges of carrying huge amounts of rope, safety equipment and survey items up and down the mountain each day. Simply reaching dficult spots pushed climbers and their non-climbing colleagues to the limit.ldquoThe botanists had a degree of climbing ability, and were very capable of climbing over slimy, muddy places which climbers think are horrible. But when it comes to rope systems to help access m high clfs, it was beyond what they could to, added Pescod.ldquoClimbers are usually looking for nice, solid rock, but thatrsquos not where these plants grow. There were loose bits of rock and sharp edges, making it all a lot harder.While the survey has ended, he said climbersrsquo new knowledge of the mountainrsquos alpine plants means they now seek them out during outings, snapping images to share with botanists and passing on what they have learned to others.ldquoItrsquos lovely to be able to climb and know what these plants are that Irsquom looking at, he added. ldquoIt elevates your day.Although the botanical survey was one of the most intense of the  projects, the most obvious one for mountain visitors was the extensive repair of km of the Ben Nevis Path, damaged by tens of thousands of walkersrsquo boots.Fixing it involved , volunteer hours and a logistical headache after stone intended for repairs and stored high up the mountain couldnrsquot be moved because of adverse weather.Alternative granite from a nearby quarry was ruled out because it came from the wrong side of the tectonic plate, meaning stone had to be sourced from quarries  miles away.After , helicopter lts of almost  tonnes of stone, a pound, investment and five years of work, the path was completed last year.As well as improvement and conservation work, the NLP five-year programme included the first excavation of Dun Deardail, a vitried hillfort at the head of the Allt nan Gleannan valley, new paths leading to the rock climbing area of Polldubh Crags and work to improve drainage at the summit.While the  projects, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, have been declared a major success, Pescod has warned a question mark over future financial backing means there is uncertainty over conservation and environmental projects on Ben Nevis and its surrounding glen.ldquoAll the brilliant stuff over five years has tangible results, but the organisation behind it is at risk of collapsing, he said.ldquoWe are losing unbelievable experience and skill in staff because of the funding system.ldquoSo many people want to visit Ben Nevis, but it needs investment to look after it."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  We re heading for a hard Brexit on Friday  but it needn t have been this way","story":"But you could be forgiven for being unaware of this historic occasion, because it only merited a footnote on news bulletins.

We really do have a major problem here.\"If you look where I live at St Cyrus, we have got rocks on the beach that used to be  foot high, they have disappeared now.\"Either you spend poundm now, or spend poundm in five or less years time, or you put Montrose underwater ndash take your pick.\"A Scottish Government managing flood risk team briefing from two years ago, seen by The Herald, highlighted the need for action over sand dune erosion that \"affect the golf course and the town in Montrose\".At that point it was estimated that between  and  metres of beach had been lost to the sea since the early s and that the Montrose coastline could wear away by up to  metres over the next  years.The experts believed the coastline has been retreating since the s and has been disappearing at a rate of two metres a year.While some had favoured a poundm coastal hard rock armour defence to be put in place quickly, the team suggested that this would just transfer the problem where.At that point, the government had made available funding of pound million per year for  years to enable local authorities to invest in flood protection works.\"The problem is that we are hitting the bottom of the dunes, it is simply eroding the dunes,\" said Mr Adams. \"It is getting serious now ndash becauseit breaches there it could go into Montrose, on the wrong tide and the wrong wind.\"A solution is being sought with discussions being held involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Angus Council.\"We want the money pulled forward, we just need a solution for Montrose,\" said Mr Adams. \"It has to be substantial ndash you are talking millions.\"A  overview of the threat.Discussions about improving sea defences in Montrose have been going on for more than two years, but new surveys have been carried out because of concerns that the rate of erosion has increased with the two -hole links courses under threat.In  it was thought that a poundm cash injection from the Scottish Government would reinforce the beach and allow the dunes to recharge.\"Rock armour isnt the answer,\" said Mr Adams. \"Rock armour will work, but visibly it is awful. You are talking three miles. And at poundm every  metres it is bloody expensive.\"We have to find a solution and it has to be something that is sustainable.\"The other way to do it ndash a more sightly way ndash is to produce an island, which would be two or three kilometres long, slightly offshore. It will do something Annat Bank was doing, but in a dferent position.\"I believe that is what we need to aim for. It would last between  and  years. The material the MPA dredge out of the bay can be put on to it, in specic positions.\"It would be an engineered product, an engineered island offshore.\"The waves hit that further offshore, dissipate that, and you dont get that wave motion hitting the sand dunes at Montrose, and we need to get beach recharge as well.\"Prof Jim Hansom, the principal researcher of the Dynamic Coast project, who is finishing off an updated examination of the erosion threat to Scotlands coasts, said \"beach nourishment\" had to be a feature of any efforts to protect Montrose.: Open season. How Kelly Holmes has been part of a mental health podcast revolution.\"The bottom line is that the most effective defence against coastal erosion is a nice, big healthy beach that reconfigures its geometry depending on wave conditions,\" said Prof Hanson. \"So when the wave conditions are low, the beach is nice and flat and when wave energy is high the beach configures itself so that it is much steeper and more absorptive of wave energy.\"Unfortunately when we experience coastal erosion, we reach for engineers, and put a concrete seawall in its place. And a concrete sea wall is often exactly the wrong thing you need to be doing in those sorts of situations.\"A sea wall is going to be too expensive in Montrose and it is probably not going to be very effective on the beach. You want to keep the beach as a recreational asset, and you dont want to change its character, because it is a spectacular beach for all sorts of reasons.\"One view on the disappearing golf course.In , a UK climate change report warned rising seas and coastal erosion had left Montrose Golf Links ldquowith nowhere to go.And in the same year, Angus Council revealed Montrose Bay had been chosen as a ldquosuper site for research into the environmental problem.Montrose Port Authority has been accused of contributing to the erosion when it dredges in the area to keep the entrance to the towns harbour clear and then dumps the material in Lunan Bay a few miles to the south.Critics say this practice is \"wasting\" dredged material that could helped protect the dunes, and links director Chris Curnin has previously saidthe material was put on to Montrose beach in the ldquocorrect position it would have a ldquosignicant impact and slow down the erosion.However, the authority has long denied these claims, and an assessment it carried out in  said that episodic weather events ndash in particular wave direction and height ndash were linked to the greatest rates of coastal erosion in the area, which took place during the early s.This period also coincided with the production of a lower volume of dredged navigational channel material.It then insisted it must be able to continue dumping dredged material around Lunan Baythe port is to remain operational."},{"url":null,"title":"no-time-complacency-coronavirus","story":"No time for complacency over coronavirusItrsquos going on five years now since I interviewed Professor Peter Piot. The global health community at the time was still reeling from the two-year-long Ebola epidemic in West Africa that started in Guinea in  and spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries, killing at least , people.Piot, the Belgian microbiologist who helped discover the Ebola virus in  and also a pioneer researcher into Aids, was the go-to expert on the subject and kindly gave his time to talk specically about Africarsquos capacity to overcome the problems the Ebola outbreak had caused.It was an insightful encounter with a medical man who, far from being critical of those African countries in which the epidemic had started, was keen to flag up the positive things about a continent that so often gets a negative press.ldquoAfrica has lots of possibilities, itrsquos the cradle of mankind, a source of inspiration, creativity and richness, insisted Piot who by then was director of the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine.ldquoWe so need to highlight the success stories, the entrepreneurs, the improvements in leadership and democratic transition in places like Senegal, he told me, clearly passionate about a place where in a professional capacity he had been engaged in fighting a virus that struck fear into the world.These past days, anyone looking for news of the latest epidemic to strike fear at a global level will doubtless have found that Piot has again become one of the mediarsquos go-to experts on the subject.He and others like him are part of the frontline defenders against those global threats to health security most of us find the thing of nightmares.For the people of Wuhan, a city of  million people in China, those nightmares are already a harsh reality. Last week, the city became the epicentre of an outbreak of a previously unknown coronavirus: nCoV, as it is known, that has displayed some uncomfortable similarities with Sars, which killed almost  people between  and .This weekend, China is marking a sombre Lunar New Year as  more deaths from the virus were reported yesterday in Wuhan, bringing the toll across the country to .Just three of those deaths have been outside Wuhan ndash one in another city in Hubei Province of which Wuhan is the capital, one in northern Hebei Province, and one in Heilongjiang, near the Russian border.Nationwide, more than  new cases of the virus were diagnosed, officials said yesterday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to nearly ,.The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build any immunity to it.That concern has been heightened given that the virus has already spread to other countries. Currently, Thailand has reported five cases, Singapore, France and Taiwan three, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea and the United States two apiece, and Nepal one. Yesterday, Australia said the virus had reached its shores.Other nations, including the UK, are investigating suspected cases of the outbreak that causes severe acute respiratory infection with symptoms including a fever and cough. While the World Health Organisationhas not yet classed the virus as an ldquointernational emergency, partly because of the low number of overseas cases, ldquoit may yet become one, warned the WHOrsquos director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Many experts, including Professor Peter Piot, agree.ldquoNational authorities and the WHO will need to continue to monitor developments very closely hellip there are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus, Piot told the Financial Times on Friday.This latest crisis, like those epidemics before it, have once again thrown into the spotlight pressing questions over global health security and levels of international preparedness.In the fast-paced and connected world we live in today, the threat of the transmission of lethal viruses and micro-organisms, potentially leading to deaths and disrupting international travel and trade, poses a uniquely formidable challenge. For the simple inescapable fact is that infectious diseases know no boundaries.Global health experts have long since argued that ease of travel in todayrsquos international community means the world must always be prepared for disease outbreaks. As history itself shows, itrsquos no longer whether an infectious disease outbreak will happen, but when.As far back as , the Spanish flu pandemic infected about  million people globally, at that time one-third of the worldrsquos population and caused the death of  to  million victims. The  swine flu outbreak that originated in Mexico and quickly became a global pandemic infected an estimated -% of the global population.In turn, the - Ebola outbreak infected , and killed over ,. Such epidemics bring with them a huge economic toll in countries often already struggling.Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries affected by the Ebola outbreak lost . billion in combined GDP, and the world had to mount a co-ordinated response at the cost of billions of dollars to contain the scourge.Ebola, of course, along with other infectious diseases continues to be a huge problem. Of late, Ebola and measles outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congohave killed , and over , respectively. Polio, too, has made its malign presence felt again in places like Afghanistan and other countries where it had been eradicated.The current Ebola outbreak, which began in August , is the second worst on record since the West Africa episode of -, even though it took the WHO until July of last year to declare this outbreak what it calls a ldquopublic health emergency of international concern .That decision by WHO brought a mixed reaction from public health officials with detractors saying it was long overdue and that unnecessary bureaucracy had prevented the designation sooner.Part of the problem, say health experts, is that in outbreaks that have dragged on for years, the word ldquoemergency refers to lots of contributing factors, among them mortality rates, the scale and global distribution of population affected,and the capacity to pull together international resources.According to a report released in September last year entitled A World At Risk by experts who make up the Global Preparedness Monitoring Boardndash set up by WHO and the World Bank ndash the world is largely unprepared for the next outbreak or pandemic.Described as a ldquosnapshot of where the world stands in its ability to prevent and contain a global health threat, the reportrsquos findings make for alarming reading and suggest that previous recommendations were either poorly implemented, or not implemented at all, and that serious gaps persist.ldquoFor too long, we have allowed a cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: we ramp up efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them when the threat subsides. It is well past time to act, the report concluded.It detailed how, between  and , WHO tracked , epidemic events in  countries. Among these events, the report said, epidemic-prone diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome , Middle East respiratory syndrome , Ebola, Zika, plague, yellow fever and others are ldquoharbingers of a new era of high-impact, potentially fast-spreading outbreaks that are more frequently detected and increasingly dficult to manage.Too much talk of preparedness in recent years and not enough action appeared to be the stinging conclusion drawn by the health experts comprising the GPMB.ldquoAfter every single major outbreak, and you go back to Sars, HN, HN, Ebola in -, you see the same thing in many of the humanitarian disasters, insisted Alex Ross, director of the GPMB Secretariat.ldquoA lot of money goes into response and then it simply disappears right afterwards, Ross told the global development media  Devex, reacting to the report at the time.As the A World At Risk report also highlighted, almost always it is the poorest that suffer most. Negative impacts, it points out, are particularly profound in fragile and vulnerable settings, where poverty, poor governance, weak health systems, lack of trust in health services, specic cultural and religious aspects, and sometimes ongoing armed conflict greatly complicate outbreak preparedness and response.Many of the countries and societies most vulnerable are already under strain from some of the worldrsquos biggest killer diseases.Malaria, for example, which has killed perhaps billions throughout history, continues to be one of the biggest killers even today.Researchers have pointed to malaria being with humanity for over , years, with startling claims that the disease has wiped out half the people who ever walked the Earth.Speculative historical figures aside, according to the latest data from the WHO, annual malaria deaths are declining, but the disease remains one of the most prolic illnesses with as many as  million infections in  alone.Dengue fever is also a growing worry with half the worldrsquos population at risk. Like malaria and Zika, the Dengue virus is mosquito-borne, and thus can spread quickly among populations. It is estimated that there are  million new infections each year.Then there is cholera which researchers have estimated there are . million to . million cases each year. While easily treatable, cholera outbreaks typically occur when conditions are severe after natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, making it dficult to treat those who need it.While Ebola and the current outbreak of coronavirus make international headlines, other diseases like Aids, flu, tuberculosis and pneumonia rarely grab media attention in the same way but also kill millions around the world.Though China has now responded quickly to the coronavirus despite earlier criticism of lethargy on the authoritiesrsquo behalf, what the crisis has again exposed is how it only takes one countryrsquos vulnerability and ill-preparedness in the face of infectious outbreaks to spell major problems for nations far beyond its borders.Citing the  global flu pandemic, in its executive summary, the A World At Risk report painted a chilling picture of what might happen given parallel circumstances today.ldquoIf a similar contagion occurred today with a population four times larger and travel times anywhere in the world less than  hours, - million people could perish, was its terrying summary.In addition to this tragic level of mortality such a pandemic could also cause panic, destabilise national security and seriously impact the global economy and trade, GPMB findings concluded.Faced with such potential doomsday scenarios, the monitoring board pulled no punches in what it sees as immediate and required actions. Paramount among these was an appeal to the United Nations to strengthen its global co-ordination mechanisms.The GPMB also stressed that ldquoWHO should introduce an approach to mobilise the wider national regional and international community at earlier stages of an outbreak prior to a declaration of a public health emergency of international concern.This weekend, at time of writing, WHO has yet to declare the coronavirus a global health emergency. The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong, meanwhile, has declared its own health emergency and said schools would be closed until mid-February. And as Wuhan and parts of China remain in lockdown instead of celebrating the Lunar New Year, the crisis grows by the hour.In , Professor Peter Piot published a book entitled No Time To Lose: A Le In Pursuit Of Deadly Viruses, which chronicled his work, including the discovery of Ebola.On Friday, speaking of the coronavirus, Piot stressed again that there was no time to lose and that regardless of the decision not to declare it a global health emergency, intensied international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping the outbreak in its tracks.ldquoThere cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action, he warned, adding the outbreak was at a ldquocrucial phase.Only the coming days will tell whether the WHO shares that same sense of urgency."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-celebrations-rub-noses-it-says-heseltine","story":"The Tory peer, who fought for Britain to stay in the EU, told The Observer newspaper the raft of celebrations risked exacerbating national isions at a time when sensitivities over leaving Europe were still high.ldquoBrexit is the most isive issue of modern times.

In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.hawick-news webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Hands-on...Superintendent Sharon Comriehas worked for the SSPCA for an incredible  years.

I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The cap only affects concerts and other major events which close off all or part of the park to non ticket-holders during normal opening hours.The business plan, which is due to be discussed by councillors next week, would effectively give the green light for major events like the Summer Sessions pop and rock concerts, the Fly Open Air dance music festival, the cityrsquos festival fireworks finale and the Hogmanay concert in the gardens to continue.The proposed limit on events which restrict public access to the gardens is three times the size of a previous official cap, which has been in place for years. It was effectively relaxed when the council decided to treat an extended series of concerts as one event.The business case also raises the prospect of new medium-sized events being staged in the gardens, such as the ldquoSummer Nights events held in Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow. It is thought there would also be flexibility to accommodate large-scale one-off events involving the likes of the BBC, MTV or the Tour de France.The overall vision for the project, which has been in the planning for five years, is to \"create and sustain a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.\"Income from all-ticket events would help subsidise the staging of smaller-scale events in the gardens, such as a Pride event, cinema screenings, showcases for buskers, school prom events and light shows.Other new events could include theatre productions, traditional arts and culture events, live music performances, spoken word events and family activities. Under the vision for the future of the park, which dates back to the mid-th century, ldquoevery Edinburgh citizen and visitor to the city will have experienced West Princes Street Gardens and the Quaich Project. Community groups would only pay a nominal fee, which could be as low as £, for the use of the gardens for their events under the new financial model, with the city council handling bookings from event organisers and promoters.It is hoped up to £, a year could be generated from the hiring out of the gardens for events and income from the new two-storey ldquogateway centre, although running costs for the new-look gardens are estimated to come to up to £, in future.The Quaich Project, a public private partnership being pursued by the city council and a trust set up by Apex Hotels founder and former Edinburgh Playhouse owner Norman Springford, would see the run-down Ross Bandstand, which opened in , replaced by a ldquoHobbit House-style pavilion for performances and an amphitheatre instead of the existing concrete bowl.A two-storey complex featuring a visitor centre, cafe and corporate hospitality facilities would offer direct access from Princes Street and boast spectacular views of events below Edinburgh Castle. The business plan has been published ahead of detailed designs for the revamp of the park being submitted to the council in the spring. A key aim is to deliver ldquoa balanced programme of activities ranging from small scale community events  learning programmes to festivals and major events throughout the year, befitting a capital city, world class visitor destination and much-loved public lsquogarden.rsquoIt states: ldquoWe will curate the use of spaces and activities throughout West Princes Street Gardens to enable a primary focus on community events which reflect the nature of the spaces involved.\"These include school and family events, lectures and talks, garden and nature tours, traditional art and culture, live music and theatre, heritage and historical programmes. The new facility will be offered at low cost for community groups and schools.ldquoWe will also procure and programme a specic number of major events which will provide high profile and high-income streams to create the affordability to community groups.ldquoWe will promote and market the project to a wide range of community bodies, schools and colleges, event and festival organisers to ensure that a healthy balance exists to enable an active yet tranquil and accessible space across the year.It is hoped that the impact of the Quaich Project will help the west end of the city withstand the impact of the new St James development, which is due to open later this year. Work is also due to be finished within months on a new Johnnie Walker visitor centre in the former House of Fraser department store, while there are plans to turn the former Royal Overseas league building opposite the bandstand into a hotel.The blueprint states: ldquoSitting in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital, the Quaich Project offers a unique  for promoting a wide iety of activity in a spectacular setting, underpinned by a core aim of providing a mix of events and activities that fulfil our mission.ldquoIt also offers a catalyst for the re-imagining of Princes Street and its environs. With the opening of the new St James Centre and the refocusing of retail activity to the eastern end of the city centre, the project has the potential to drive the context of the area ndash cultural, social, wellbeing and environmental themes dominating a space currently occupied by buses and shops.In his report for next weekrsquos culture committee, place director Paul Lawrence states: ldquoThe completion of the refurbishment and development of West Princes Street Gardens in general, and the redevelopment of the Ross Pavilion and the construction of the associated gateway building in particular, is to the benefit of residents, visitors, event organisers and festivals, and Edinburghrsquos reputation.Donald Wilson, the city councilrsquos culture chief, said: ldquoThis is a very important stage in the project to reimagine West Princes Street Gardens.ldquoThe core focus for the business model is on community access and activity by creating and sustaining a space for all in the heart of the city, celebrating nature, reflection, community and performance.ldquoThis is a model where big events that involve exclusive access to the gardens are kept to a minimum, but these will make it possible to offer low cost rental of spaces to community or charitable organisations. Crucially, it proposes no more event days than we have at present.ldquoWest Princes Street Gardens are open almost every day of the year, with early closure for events, mainly in the evenings, amounting to less than % of normal opening times. It is estimated that within the new operating model this would continue.ldquoThe proposed new access route behind the pavilion is estimated to reduce event set up and takedown times by at least  per cent, thus reducing the impact on the gardens.David Ellis, managing director of the Quaich Project, said: ldquoOur vision is to improve the entirety of the gardens with a focus on making them a more enjoyable and accessible place for the benefit of Edinburgh residents and visitors all year round. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

Rory Gallaghers side had two chances to win the game in stoppage time. First Shane Quinn blocked down Carlus McWilliams left-footed shot and Quinns interception stopped Brendan Rogers run in the last attack of the game. In the end, a share of the spoils was as much as Derry could hope for. Barring Shane McGuigans th minute goal, to level the game, they lacked the cutting edge to put Leitrim away. All too often, they coughed up possession when on the attack. googletag.cmd.push Watch: Its relief not to be beat - @Doiregaa boss Rory Gallagher #AllianzLeagues pic kdBqick — County Derry Post January ,     Derry had the breeze but registered two wides and dropped two efforts short before Ciaran McFaul opened the scoring in the eighth minute. The visitors were having great joy on the counter attack and went - up and deservedly so. Keith Beirne and Shane Moran were causing bother for Derrys defence. In the th minute it got worse for Derry. Goalkeeper Odhraacuten Lynch punched Domhnaill Flynns diagonal cross down into the path of Cillian McGloin, who jinked inside before roofing a shot to the net. Emmett Bradley and Ryan Bell hit points as Derry recovered but anytime they turned over the ball, Leitrim punished them on the break. googletag.cmd.push Liam McGoldrick and Chrissy McKaigue began to get to grips in defence and Derry began to gain confidence. Ciaran McFaul and Gavin ONeill were influential and started to go at Leitrim. ONeill passed to Emmett Bradley who hit a blockbuster to the top corner in the nd minute and Derry were within a point Eoghan Duffy, who had an earlier half-chance for goal saved, tied the game before skipper McKaigue put Derry - to - ahead at the break. Terry Hylands men, who bounced back from a hammering to Roscommon in the FBD league, hit the first four points of the second-half. They penned Derry into their own half and Domhnaill Flynns long-range effort was a sign of intent, before three Keith Beirne points put them in the driving seat. Just when Derry needed a spark, Emmett Bradley won a kick-out on the wing. Seconds later, when Ciaran McFauls high ball dropped in round the house, it was punched clear by goalkeeper Diarmuid McKiernan but Ryan Bell fed McGuigan who drilled to the net. Still it was Leitrim who got themselves back in front and looked the likely winners. With a minute to go, league debutant Ben McCarron fired over a beauty before McFaul levelled the game. Derry must pick up the pieces ahead of a trip to Paacuteirc Esler next Saturday to play Down managed by former Oakleaf selector Paddy Tally.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “Over recent months, we have been reporting street lighting faults on an almost daily basis in every part of my constituency. The response has sadly been that due to budgetary constraints, the Department are only providing a limited street lighting repair service with priority repairs focused on emergency repairs, group outages and all day burners, followed by single light defects.”“This is alarming. Adequate street lighting is imperative to provide safe streets, deter crime and anti-social behaviour and crucially provides elderly residents with security and safety and the assurance that they are not isolated and alone. In some areas a single light can be % of the lighting in a cul-de-sac, so the fact that one light is out makes a real dference.”“Having raised the issue with the Divisional Office, I was advised this was due to budgetary constraints and until additional funds became available, only a limited repair service would be possible. I subsequently sought an intervention from the Permanent Secretary and sought details as to the extent of the problem.”“To my astonishment, the Department have now confirmed that almost , lights are out at present across the North.

Do people really think that when you strip out vital financial and human resources from a basic service that it will have no impact ”The SDLP Assemblyman added: This needs to be urgently addressed. I will continue to liaise with Departmental officials to press for action.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

January.The event will include contributions from some of Ireland’s leading sus- tainability experts and innovators.The theme of Dr Doherty’s address will be “Rethinking Green Spaces,” an area in which Derry City and Strabane District Council has been leading on with the recent publication of their pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan.Speaking ahead of the event, Dr Doherty noted the local authority had led the way in transforming the way its green spaces are used.“Transforming and valuing our local green spaces to benefit people, our economy and environment is a key priority for Derry City and Strabane District Council, which is outlined in our cutting edge Green Infrastructure Plan,” she said.“We are the first local authority in Northern Ireland to produce a Green Infrastructure Plan and associated action plan which highlights the signicant positive health implications of spending time in green spaces, the critical role ecosystem services play for mitigating against climate change, as well as the potential opportunities they offer for businesses to create jobs locally, for example, through expanding our greenway network.“We are currently in the process of assessing the monetary value of our green spaces through the creation of a Natural Capital Account in partnership with Vivid Economics and The Carnegie Trust.“This pioneering research will show the benefits of living close to a park or green area, which increases the value of property as well as providing a community space for people to socialise and exercise.“The results highlight that green areas provide signicant mental and physical wellbeing value as well as recreational benefits and improvements to the air that we breathe.”The National Sustainability Summit aims to enable visitors to keep up-to-date with the latest trends, innovations, best practice and new technological solutions available.The event will address areas such as optimising water usage, renewable energy, sustainable packaging, waste minimisation and moving towards a circular economy.It will also highlight how the power of data and technology can be harnessed to achieve more transparent supply chains. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is focussing on four constituencies - Cavan, Wexford, Donegal and the retention of the Meath West seat. ,However, Cllr McCloskey said she felt it was important to stand in Sligo Leitrim. Aontuacute is a fledgling political party, she said. We have a group of very committed activists in Sligo who were very keen for someone to stand. The constituency takes in all of counties Sligo and Leitrim, part of southern Donegal and part of northern Roscommon.” googletag.cmd.push  Peter Casey Cllr McCloskey said the party had a “mountain to climb” with just over two weeks to polling day on  February but she was “looking forward to the challenge.” Cllr McCloskey claimed the party had gained supporters from across the political spectrum, including from the unionist community. Aontuacute was established last year after Peadar Toacuteibiacuten left Sinn Feacutein. He claimed he had been ostracised from the party because of his opposition to abortion. Several high-profile former Sinn Feacutein members, including Francie and Anne Brolly, later joined the party. Aontuacute claimed three seats in last years local elections in the Republic.If elected, Cllr McCloskey would be expected to stand down from her seat on Derry City and Strabane District Council.Meanwhile, former Presidential candidate Peter Casey this week revealed his intention to stand as a General Election candidate in Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s constituency.Mr Casey, who lives in Greencastle in Inishowen, had already filed papers to stand in Donegal, revealed he nominated himself to stand in Dublin West.The businessman finished second behind Michael D Higgins in the  Presidential race, when he drew controversy over his remarks about the Travelling community.He also unsuccessfully stood for European Parliament in the Midlands-North West constituency last year. Announcing his candidacy, Mr Casey said he was standing in the Dublin constituency to give people an opportunity to register “an obvious protest vote” against Varadkar.“The Taoiseach’s string of failures is recorded for all to see,” he said.“There’s the swing-gate and fobgate scandals, the National Children’s Hospital disgrace, the broadband spending debacle, the unprecedented crises in health and housing – list goes on and people have had enough… “People are right to be angry and that’s why I’m giving them the opportunity to voice their anger directly by voting for me in Dublin West.”Speaking at the registration office, the -year-old said he believed Mr Varadkar was not fit to be Taoiseach, but said he would not canvas there, adding that his primary goal would be to represent the people of Donegal.As well as the Taoiseach, Mr Casey will face competition for the Dublin constituency’s four seats from outgoing TDs Joan Burton of Labour, Fianna Faacuteil’s Jack Chambers, and Solidarity-People Before Profit’s Ruth Coppinger.Others standing in the constituency include Fine Gael’s Emer Currie, Sinn Feacutein’s Paul Donnelly, the Green Party’s Roderic O’Gorman, Aengus Oacute Maolaacutein, Aontuacute’s Edward Mac Manus and independent candidates Stephen O’Loughlin and Sean O’Leary. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking as the first phase of the scheme neared completion Kevin Campbell, development worker with the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team, said: “In the last few years it has become clear that there are increasing numbers of older residents in the Triax area who are experiencing problems maintaining the exterior of their homes or gardens, for whatever reason.” googletag.cmd.push “Recognising this, and working with Awards for All and other groups we have been able to design and fund a pilot programme of home assistance for older residents in three identied areas in the Triax area. This programme is obviously complementary to the ongoing work of the Triax Neighbourhood Management Team and helps us help harder to reach residents.” Mr Campbell continued: “The TNMT are delighted to be able to provide this assistance and in the next few months we will also be in the Iniscarn and Beechwood areas as this scheme rolls out. “As we work towards making the area a cleaner, safer and more welcoming place to live it is crucial we assist those who need assistance to make the dferences that matter to them. The Awards for All funded Home Assistance Programme is helping us to do that.” googletag.cmd.push Oakfield resident, Charles O’Donnell, who has helped roll out the scheme said: “Little did I realise when Kevin contacted me how the scheme would impact on iniduals within the Oakfield area. “After an initial assessment during which a multitude of homes were visited a list of properties which required urgent and essential work was drawn up. During the following two weeks nine of these received a iety of works from basic power washing, removal of large amounts of wasps and, in two particular cases extensive cutting back of hedges, brambles and trees.” “A particular highlight of strength of the scheme was the group of men who carried out the work. Good craic, kind, considerate, welcoming and extremely hard working are just a few words which describe the team.” Mr ODonnell concluded: “The residents and myself will be eternally grateful for their consideration and support. Sincere thanks to Donna, Kevin and the whole TRIAX team.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences. The impact on consumers must be central to discussions on the future of heating, and cost and disruption minimisedsupport for climate change action is to be forthcoming.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
