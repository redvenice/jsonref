We\u0027re on the precipice of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil again for the first time since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011,\u0027 said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. The only thing keeping Ripley company was a soft plush toy version of planet Earth - which demonstrated when the rocket reached zero gravity.Elated Musk shared a video of the toy floating in space on his Twitter shortly after the successful launch.As the rocket took off, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken looked on.The pair could strap into another Dragon capsule as early as July for the second space demo.           Pictured: Sigourney Weaver as Ripley in Alien (1979)It\u0027s been eight years since Hurley and three other astronauts flew the last space shuttle mission, and human launches from Florida ceased.NASA turned to private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, and has provided them $8 billion to build and operate crew capsules to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Now Russian rockets are the only way to get astronauts to the 250-mile-high outpost. Soyuz tickets have skyrocketed over the years - NASA currently pays $82million per seat.Boeing aims to conduct the first test flight of its Starliner capsule in April, with astronauts on board possibly in August.An estimated 5,000 NASA and contractor employees, tourists and journalists gathered in the wee hours at Kennedy Space Center with the SpaceX launch team, as the Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from the same spot where Apollo moon rockets and space shuttles once soared.Bridenstine said he\u0027s confident that astronauts will soar on a Dragon or Starliner - or both - by year\u0027s end. But he stressed there\u0027s no rush.          SpaceX founder Elon Musk gave a post-launch news conference this morning after the test flight successfully took off          The capsule\u0027s only passenger was a test dummy (pictured), named Ripley after the lead character in the Alien movies          This latest, flashiest Dragon is on a fast track to reach the space station on Sunday morning, just 27 hours after liftoff           NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken could strap in as early as July if this test flight goes well   Pictured: the Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket, ready for launch, sits on pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, yesterday\u0027We are not in a space race,\u0027 he said. \u0027That race is over. We went to the moon and we won. It\u0027s done. Now we\u0027re in a position where we can take our time and make sure we get it right.\u0027 The white crew Dragon is slightly bigger than cargo versions - 27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip - and considerably fancier and safer.It features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergency. Solar cells are mounted on the spacecraft for electrical power, as opposed to the protruding solar wings on cargo Dragons.\u0027It\u0027s an incredibly sleek looking vehicle from the inside and it\u0027s very easy to operate,\u0027 Hurley told reporters just hours before liftoff. He said he marvels at how the Dragon has just 30 buttons and touch screens, compared with the space shuttle cockpit\u0027s 2,000 switches and circuit breakers.For the test, the Ripley dummy was strapped into the far left seat, wearing the company\u0027s snappy white spacesuit. The other seats were empty, save for a small plush toy resembling Earth that was free to float once reaching zero-gravity. \u0027Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!\u0027 Musk tweeted.SpaceX already has made 16 trips to the space station using cargo Dragons - but this capsule is slightly bigger than those at  27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip, and considerably fancier and safer          The Dragon capsule features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergencyAs many as seven astronauts could squeeze in, although four will be the norm once flights get going, allowing for a little cargo room. About 450 pounds (200 kilograms) of supplies are going up on this flight.The capsule is designed to dock and undock automatically with the space station. Cargo Dragon must be maneuvered with the station\u0027s robot arm.Like Ripley, the capsule is rigged with sensors. Engineers will be carefully watching sound, vibration and other stresses on the spacecraft, while monitoring the life-support, communication and propulsion systems. Some of the equipment needs more work - possibly even redesign - before serving human passengers.\u0027We\u0027re going to learn a ton from this mission,\u0027 said NASA\u0027s commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders.Flight operations team members - some of them new to this - also need the six-day trial run, according to Kennedy Space Center\u0027s director, Robert Cabana.The objective is to make the next demo flight, with Hurley and Behnken, as safe as possible. The more immediate goal is to avoid harming the space station and its three occupants: an American, Canadian and Russian.Despite SpaceX\u0027s success at recovering and reusing its rockets, NASA is insisting on brand new boosters from SpaceX for the crew capsule flights. The first-stage booster used Saturday aimed for a floating platform in the Atlantic, following the predawn liftoff. SpaceX plans to recycle the newly flying capsule for a high-altitude abort test this spring, along with a booster launched and retrieved a week ago.

The approach mirrors that adopted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children, George, five, Charlotte, three, and Louis, ten months.They later appointed Maria Borrallo, a graduate of the prestigious Norland College, when George was a few months old, although it is understood that Meghan may bring in a nanny when her child is younger than that.Last night Norland College declined to say if they had been approached by the couple.It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three children.          It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three childrenWhile Meghan will take formal maternity leave and is unlikely to attend public engagements, she is determined to remain active behind the scenes working for her various causes. But a source said: ‘This is her first baby and there will be a certain degree of playing it by ear.’In January, Meghan became patron of the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the animal welfare charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get jobs.She will this week join a panel including singer Annie Lennox and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to mark International Women’s Day, where they will discus issues such as ‘access to education and limitations in employment’.Meanwhile, builders have been working feverishly to complete the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Home Park, Windsor. Harry and Meghan hope to move to the Grade II listed property from Kensington Palace within the next three weeks.The move may mean that Meghan chooses not to give birth at the Lindo Wing, the exclusive maternity ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Central London where the Duchess of Cambridge had her three children, but instead use a hospital ‘closer to home’.One option would be Frimley Park Hospital in Berkshire, which is about 15 miles from Windsor and where the Countess of Wessex had her children. It comes amid reports Meghan and Harry are considering raising their child \u0027gender neutral\u0027 – understood to mean they will not enforce any male or female stereotypes.        Gender neutral:  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be looking at bring up their child without gender stereotypes According to a source, who has known the Duchess for many years and was at her wedding: \u0027Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby.\u0027She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won\u0027t be imposing any stereotypes.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the couple could choose to forgo traditional blues and pinks to match the baby\u0027s gender. They could also avoid conventional gender-biased toys such as dolls for girls and train sets for boys.Last night a senior Kensington Palace aide refused to rule out the possibility of the baby being raised gender neutral.       Gone with traditional: Meghan pictured meeting youngsters on a recent trip to Morocco will do away with blue and pink colour schemes and would not wish them to be surrounded with conventional toys            Keeping quiet: Kensington Palace have refused to comment on plans to bring up the baby gender fluid The couple are understood to have chosen neutral grey and white hues for the nursery, rather than the blue or pink.Meghan has transformed her husband in many ways: Harry has given up alcohol in solidarity with his pregnant wife, quit smoking and recently revealed he starts the day by meditating. But the Duke is still very much a traditionalist at heart. He has continued his passion for hunting and shooting despite Meghan\u0027s love for animals.And as a young boy, he was always running around Highgrove in military fatigues, climbing trees and playing toy soldiers with Prince William.Meghan has also revealed she played with dolls as a child.A spokesman for Kensington Palace last night said: \u0027The Duke and Duchess are extremely excited to welcome their first child in the spring.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"MPs want raise legal smoking age 21","story":"Experts believe raising the limit would help to stop people trying out cigarettes at a young age Taxes on tobacco products should be increased and rules tightened on showing smoking on TV and in films, the group said.Penny Woods, of The British Lung Foundation, said: \u0027Raising the age of sale from 18 to 21 will help stop experimentation from becoming a fatal habit and reinforce the dangers of tobacco.\u0027 But pro-smoking group Forest has accused MPs of \u0027infantilising\u0027 young adults.Inside the B\u0026S ball: A uniquely Australian tradition which...The deadly propaganda of the statin deniers: The drugs DO...Share this articleThe smoking rate in the UK has fallen to second-lowest in Europe in recent years but officials are keen to reduce the toll further.The proposals are being backed by 17 health organisations including the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and charities such as Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation.Tory MP Bob Blackman, who heads the group which was instrumental in the introduction of the smoking ban in public places in 2007, said: \u0027Smoking remains the leading cause of premature death and health inequalities.\u0027           He said further regulations were essential to the Government\u0027s plan of increasing healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035, while \u0027reducing inequalities between the richest and poorest in society\u0027.Smoking contributes to 4 per cent of hospital admissions in England each year and costs the NHS around £2.5billion annually.Despite being the leading cause of preventable death in the UK, around six million Britons still light up. The Department of Health aims to cut rates of 15-year-old smokers from 8 to 3 per cent, and reduce smoking among adults from 15.5 to 12 per cent within three years.But the cross-party group warned that the 2017 Tobacco Control Plan\u0027s reliance on cash-strapped local authorities to help bring about a smoke-free generation was \u0027unrealistic\u0027.Tobacco firms should be charged a \u0027polluter pays\u0027 levy for smoking control – which could raise £150million, it urged. Meanwhile, taxes on tobacco should be raised to 5 per cent above inflation – with an equal surcharge added to both loose tobacco and cigarettes.Lord Rennard, a vice-chairman of the group, said: \u0027Tobacco manufacturing is by far and away the most profitable consumer industry in the world and Big Tobacco can certainly afford to pay more to clear up the devastating damage its products cause.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Hardline Brexiteers present Theresa peace deal terms backing Brexit deal","story":"    Prisons Minister Rory Stewart warned that delaying Brexit made it more likely there might be a general election or a deal eventually agreed that was not as good for the country as that which Mrs May is seeking          The Prime Minister, pictured leaving church today, warned MPs that they would need to back her deal if they wanted to avoid a delay to Article 50 or to avoid a no-deal situation\u0027Because if you think that through, extension to Article 50, which is going to be a vote which would effectively give lets say a couple of month\u0027s extension, would resolve nothing.\u0027It would put us in a world in which we were still in a zombie world, not knowing where we were going.\u0027And it would increase the chance of other options. It increased the chance either of people pushing for general elections which wouldn\u0027t solve everything, for another referendum … or it would push people towards a customs union which would stop us trading with the rest of the world.\u0027In private talks the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the Government\u0027s legal advice, the Sunday Times said.It comes after senior eurosceptics appeared to dramatically soften their insistence that the Withdrawal Agreement must be rewritten to remove the Northern Irish border backstop provision.They included Mr Rees-Mogg and even the Democratic Unionist Party, who seem to have been startled by moves by MPs to delay Brexit to avoid leaving without a deal.The move by the ERG came as the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned that a Brexit delay is now \u0027unavoidable\u0027 even if MPs back a deal next week.Barnier backed up the private positions of many of the Remainers in Theresa May\u0027s Cabinet by saying she does not have time to make a deal.Theresa May has threatened MPs in recent weeks to back her \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on March 12 or risk further delaying Brexit or a no-deal scenario.Barnier told Spain\u0027s El Mundo that Brussels would not green light a Brexit deal on March 29 even if Parliament reached an agreement.           The EU\u0027s chief negotiator has slapped down Mrs May\u0027s notion of securing a withdrawal by March 29, suggesting she take a two month extensionMr Barnier suggested a \u0027technical extension\u0027 of up to two months would be needed. Referencing a technical extension, Mr Barnier added: \u0027But you\u0027ll have to ask the United Kingdom. If there is a vote on the 12th and it takes two months to carry out the procedure, it would be justified.\u0027Mrs May has said that if her deal is rejected by Parliament, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, and if that is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit for a limited period. But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said that there may be \u0027no option\u0027 but to delay leaving.He told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr programme: \u0027It would be very unfortunate were that to happen.\u0027But, if we have no option, in order to deliver a smooth Brexit, then so be it.\u0027Today the leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a joint warning to the Prime Minister over colleagues they believe are poised to delay or block Article 50 altogether.The pair write in the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027The active pursuit of a delay to Brexit - with no purpose beyond frustration - is a betrayal of the referendum result.\u0027They say this would be an \u0027irretrievable breach of trust\u0027 to those who voted Brexit but also warned against the ruptures that would be caused by a no-deal. How Cox\u0027s \u0027codpiece\u0027 might save the day and allow PM\u0027s...PM\u0027s war on \u0027death cult\u0027 Tories: Vote down Brexit deal again...Share this articleTory MP George Eustice, who quit as a minister last week in protest at the PM\u0027s Brexit stance, told Sky News: \u0027If Parliament cannot accept this deal we have to have the confidence and the courage as a country to walk away first and talk after.\u0027The other thing about no deal is that it doesn\u0027t mean no deal forever more.\u0027It\u0027s a bit of a misnomer. No deal, probably, in effect means an informal transition period for nine months.\u0027The news comes as Mr Barnier said Brussels was ready to give further \u0027guarantees, assurances and clarifications\u0027 that the Irish backstop should only be temporary.The backstop has been a sticking point for Brexiteers who see it as undermining the very sovereignty the UK stands to gain through leaving the EU. Mr Barnier insisted that the controversial measure, intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, will not be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement.While acknowledging Brexiteer concerns that the backstop is a trap that would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, Mr Barnier insisted it is only \u0027insurance\u0027 intended for the \u0027worst-case scenario\u0027.Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt, Mr Barnier said: \u0027We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.\u0027This is not the case.

Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.Meng\u0027s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China.

A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.Gary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada\u0027s Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\u0027They took her under custody without telling her why,\u0027 Botting said. \u0027They disguised the real reason why they detained her.

He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.Lynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\u0027The violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\u0027 Ong said. \u0027But that\u0027s not even possible for them.

The Princess Royal is known for her talents at horse riding and is the first member of the British Royal Family to have competed in the Olympic Games equestrian sportsSome, it must be said, are stultifyingly boring, though when I once mentioned this aspect of her work, her reply was a masterpiece of diplomatic understatement. ‘Some are perhaps less interesting than the others,’ she said.Always near the top in the annual league table for engagements carried out by working royals, Anne has worked tirelessly for causes in Britain and abroad.Anne maintains an old-world sense of formality — witness the very full curtsey she gave to King Abdullah of Jordan last week — while being the Royal Family’s most willing moderniser.But if younger royals and new recruits to The Firm need a role model, then there is no one better.     Princess Anne at a meeting of the British Olympic Association in 1984, who which she has served as president for over 40 years. Anne first participated in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal as a member of the British team, riding the Queen\u0027s horse, Goodwill          Duties can vary greatly for the Royals, and include some somber occasions. Here Princess Anne talks to John Young, 42, a civil servant from Belfast who survived the M1 Kegworth air crash in Leicestershire that killed 47 people and injured dozens moreThe range of her interests is breathtaking: from Accessible Oceans (which aims to facilitate the disabled on water), the Acid Survivors Trust (to end acid and burns violence globally) and the Animal Health Trust, to Women in the Royal Navy (of which she is Admiral, Chief Commandant, her only uniformed appointment), Riding for the Disabled and the Butler Trust, an organisation that rewards high standards in prison work.During one visit to Cardiff Prison she met a man who was just starting a life sentence. He told her how different she looked from photographs, saying: ‘You’re much better looking and younger. I could even fancy you.’It didn’t faze the Princess, and she was in no hurry to escape, laughing and joking with inmates and officers alike.Anne has travelled the world as a royal and on behalf of her organisations — recent trips include Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Bosnia — meeting everyone, from presidents and prime ministers to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.

This was the first state visit for the Spanish Royal Family since 1986 with King Juan Carlos and Queen SofiaIn that context, she’s perhaps best known for her work with Save the Children, a charity she became president of in 1970, a role she held until 2016, when she accepted the position of patron in succession to her mother.She concedes that being royal opens doors — and that is all she asks. Once inside she knows it is up to her and the charity officials.Her credo is helping those in need, no matter who they are or where they come from. They may be refugees from civil war-torn countries such as the Yemen, Marxist-controlled countries, orphans in any of the one-party states of Africa or young mothers in India and Bangladesh.It makes no difference to her she never becomes involved in any of the political problems.As she once famously remarked following an African tour: ‘I don’t come here looking for trouble. I come to see if I can help.’ And in response to a comment on her supposed lack of the maternal instinct, she said: ‘You don’t have to like children particularly to want to give them a decent chance in life.’    Military duties: Princess Anne salutes military veterans as they march past on Horse Guards Parade during the National Service of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in Westminster in 2018.

She didn’t get it — it went to Mikhail Gorbachev, the Russian leader.Her tours have placed her in some very un-royal situations. On one occasion in the Sudan, she was highly amused to be told that a fresh toilet pit had been dug in her honour — solely for her use.And in another African country, where the women traditionally go bare-breasted, a member of the accompanying party wondered aloud where she was going to pin the medals she was expected to award. It’s a story Prince Philip loves to retell.Nor does Anne stand on ceremony. Once, as a member of the British Olympic Association, she was in the U.S. helping to raise funds. At a black-tie dinner in Houston, she just about managed to keep a straight face when one of the guests asked her to ‘congratulate your mother on being re-elected’. (She has also been asked: ‘Is Winston Churchill your grandfather?’)It was on that same visit that Anne displayed her laid-back sense of humour when she remarked to one of her bodyguards who was going bald: ‘It’s enough to make your hair curl. Well, perhaps not in your case.’Nor is she averse to the odd ribald comment. As Patron of the Scottish Rugby Union for more than 30 years, she rarely misses a match at Murrayfield and saw the joke when one of the Scotland team suggested she join them in the showers to celebrate a win.She takes it all in her stride.There is yet still more to Anne’s achievements than duty, and it’s easy to forget the number of firsts she has accumulated.She was the first member of the Royal Family to win a major international sporting title when she became European Three-Day Event champion in 1971 she was the first royal to be voted the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year, and then to compete in an Olympic Games as a member of the British equestrian team in Montreal in 1976.She was also the first royal to wear a mini skirt and holds the rather more dubious distinction of being the first daughter of a reigning sovereign to be orced.As the Queen’s only daughter, Anne has never been anything but royal, yet she famously declined an earldom for her first husband, Mark Phillips, as the Queen wished, or titles for either of her children, Peter and Zara. She thought they would be a burden.How different from Princess Margaret, who when she married photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960, insisted he be raised to the rank of an earl."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/03/23/0CF0C5F200000578-6767101-image-m-29_1551654639581.jpg","title":"Luxury handbag label Anya Hindmarch sale","story":"    Royal favourite: The Duchess of Cambridge holds an Anya Hindmarch clutch bag as she meets Michelle Obama in 2011 Anya Hindmarch, a luxury handbag brand favoured by Kate Middleton, has been put up for sale after losing £28.2million. The firm\u0027s Qatari owners have abandoned the London-based firm in the latest sign of struggles for the Duchess\u0027s high street favourites after LK Bennett went into administration last week. The brand, founded by fashion designer Hindmarch in 1987, made heavy losses in 2017 and reported a 10 per cent decline in revenue, at £37.2million. The Duchess of Cambridge showed her fondness for the brand in one of her earliest engagements after her 2011 wedding to Prince William. Meeting then- U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle at Buckingham Palace, the newly-created Duchess carried a black clutch bag from the label. The same year she  took a gold Anya Hindmarch clutch bag with her her new husband play in a charity polo game in California -

Would he be interested, they asked, in moving to Manhattan to run an as yet unbuilt arts centre, to which $75m (£57m) in public money had been committed but for which, at that stage, there were no offices, no staff, no website, no bank account and no mission, beyond that of creating something that was “unlike anything else in New York”? A blank space, in other words, and “terrifying”, says Poots, which is why his instinct was to jump and say yes. “There’s that quote: if you’re not in over your head, how will you ever find out how tall you are?”Five years later, we are in the offices of what, this April, is going to open as the Shed, the largest new art space to have opened in New York since the Lincoln Center in 1962. Since being hired, Poots and his board have raised half-a-billion dollars in private funding and doubled the scale of the Shed so that, when it opens this spring with a programme of original commissions including works by Steve McQueen and Björk, it will be in a multistorey glass complex where the largest performance space can accommodate up to 1,200 people. There will be rehearsal and lab spaces for emerging artists, a pop-up bookshop and a 20,000 sq ft outdoor plaza for huge events. Behind all of this will be Poots who, at 52, has the kinetic energy of someone staring down an extremely short deadline and asks the central question of any public art space: “Who is it for?”A quick way to answer this is to revisit one of the small, pivotal disagreements Poots had with the original concept for the Shed when he signed on in 2014. At that point, it existed largely as the brainchild of Daniel Doctoroff, at the time deputy mayor of New York under Michael Bloomberg, who came up with the idea of a spectacularly funded arts space to be built alongside Hudson Yards, a luxury housing development on the west side of Manhattan that was attracting criticism as yet another of the city’s gifts to the rich. The Culture Shed, as it was then called, would be built on public land as a way of broadening the scope of the overall development.All of which sounded great to Poots, with the exception of the name. “I didn’t like the sound of it,” he says. “Culture Shed – it sounded a bit preachy.” He called a friend, one of the creative directors at Framestore, the company responsible for the CGI sequences in the Alfonso Cuarón film, Gravity. “And he said, ‘Why would you call it Culture Shed? It’s like a soap opera putting on a laugh track to tell your dumb audience when to laugh.’” Then he called Marina Abramovic, who in her inimitable style said: “Why call it that? When they made Apple, they didn’t call it the Apple Computer.”Finally, Poots went back to the board and suggested dropping “culture” from the title and just calling it the Shed. “I liked the idea of the Shed because it’s where you make things,” he said. Plus, “it would’ve been shortened anyway, like the Met, so you may as well save on rebranding costs in three years’ time.”The point about all this is that Poots wanted to signal, from the name down, that this was not a conventional museum or a gatekeeper to high culture. It would not house a permanent collection, nor would it stage revivals of existing works. It was a radical new space for work across all disciplines, “a commissioning centre for all arts”, which, in New York at least, had never been done before, with an emphasis on emerging talent. The inaugural show will be a five-night concert series called Soundtrack of America, a celebration of African American music directed by McQueen, but featuring largely unknown musicians. “We’re launching a half-a-billion dollar arts facility with unknown, early-career African American talent.”If anyone can democratise access to the arts it is Poots, whose work as an impresario goes back to his early 20s, when he played trumpet in a band and, with the canny eye he would later bring to multimillion dollar shows, told the band leader after a single rehearsal: “This band could be better and I should start by firing myself.” It was his short-lived career as a trumpet player that laid the foundations for everything that came after, teaching Poots to be suspicious of the conventional hierarchies between high and low art, and before that, while he was still a schoolboy in Edinburgh, suggesting to him he could actually be good at something.“I was really painfully average at everything else,” he says, whose Irish father was a dentist and French mother a teacher. “None of it interested me. But I had this thing – I was able to play the trumpet really well – and if I hadn’t had that, I’d probably be on the scrapheap somewhere.”He trained classically, but started doing jazz and pop from an early age. “Subconsciously, I had the feeling, ‘Why is it when I go out and play pop, it’s second-class music, even though sometimes when I play it, I’m playing better than I ever have? But when I go out and do a classical thing, that’s like the pillar of everything, whether I’ve played well or not?’ That has definitely informed everything I’ve done.”For a while, Poots thought he might become a professional musician. Then, one night in his early 20s, he had a sobering experience after performing in a production of Verdi’s Requiem in Edinburgh. “I was doing the offstage trumpet part, where you do nothing for most of the production, then play for about three minutes and go home. It’s highly stressful and I had a dream that night, in which I was doing Verdi’s Requiem but I was 50 – the age I am now. And the thing that woke me up in a cold sweat was that it wasn’t quite as good as when I was 20.”For the next 10 years, Poots worked his way through the major institutions of British culture, starting at the Barbican as a curator and moving on to oversee projects with David Brook at Channel 4 and Nick Serota at the Tate, including a series called Tate Live, his first real foray into visual art, in which he worked with McQueen, Wolfgang Tillmans and Arvo Pärt. He was very good at creating events that generated publicity but which occasionally backfired. In 2001, Poots came up with the first Fatboy Slim concert on Brighton beach – “I remember pitching that idea to Norman” – to which tens of thousands turned up, causing chaos and dominating headlines.He was also very good at dismantling traditional barriers between the arts. In 2005, when Poots was appointed as artistic director of the inaugural Manchester international festival, he wanted to celebrate the city’s roots as the first modern industrial centre by investing in wholly new projects. One of the breakout successes in Manchester was Monkey: Journey to the West, a pop opera collaboration between Damon Albarn’s band Gorillaz and the director Chen Shi-Zheng, a stage production with an anarchic circus-like feel to it and an electric energy. “He’s constantly challenging you by putting different kinds of creative forces together the kind of thing nobody would think of doing, but he does,” says Chen, whose new show, Dragon Spring Phoenix Rise, is in the opening lineup for the Shed. When Poots first approached Chen with the idea of creating an opera in Manchester, they cycled through scores of potential music collaborators until Poots suggested Gorillaz. “He showed me their video and their songs, and I immediately fell for it. I thought this would work.”Chen’s new show is styled as a “futuristic kung fu musical” and written with Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, creators of the Kung Fu Panda movie franchise, and would have been impossible to stage anywhere else, he says. The liberating thing about the Shed is that it marries Poots’s vision to a flexible performance space, in which the walls can retract and the audience can be moved around. “Directors are always trying to destroy the proscenium theatre, to expand, come out, extend and come closer to the audience,” says Poots. “A new space gives new opportunities for your art form. Now we have that.”Among other startling collaborations in the Shed’s opening schedule will be the dramatic work Norma Jeane Baker of Troy, written by the poet Anne Carson and starring Ben Whishaw and Renée Fleming (Carson wrote it specifically with Whishaw in mind and after reading the script he jumped at it). The painter Gerhard Richter will collaborate with the composer Steve Reich for an immersive live performance.One of the most exciting events will be the Shed’s opening show, Soundtrack of America, devised and directed by McQueen and with a creative team including Quincy Jones. As Poots says: “I don’t think anyone can disagree that African American music is the most influential art form of the past 100 years. I don’t think even film goes as deep and as far as this.” Each night, a handful of artists will trace the roots of their own music back through the genealogy of African American music and, after performing that journey, “will end with their song”.McQueen and Poots have known each other for almost 20 years in fact, it was McQueen who introduced Poots to his wife, Kathryn Spellman, a visiting sociology professor at Columbia University. “What I like about Alex,” says McQueen, “is that he says ‘let’s do it’. In the UK, it’s often about making do, or being told we can’t do that. But he says ‘let’s do it’ and that mentality is very similar to mine.”The word “relevance” can be deadly to any artistic production, but Poots is keen for younger audiences, in particular, to have a sense of the impact of how obscure or abstract works can resonate in the real world. He cites Henry David Thoreau’s essay, Civil Disobedience, written in 1849, “which goes on decades later to inspire Mandela, and Martin Luther King. What very few people know was that Thoreau was inspired by a 13th-century poet from Persia, called Saadi of Shiraz. So you can say to a bunch of kids: ‘Who says that art doesn’t have the power to influence changing society? Here’s a really good example.’”The education and involvement of young people is one of Poots’s primary ambitions for the Shed. He talks with frustration about his experience of education departments at many cultural centres in the UK, which, he says, have tended to be “the poor relation”. “It was the thing you put at the end of the corridor to satisfy the Arts Council. And I thought, ‘Can’t we do better?’ I wanted the Shed to have the widest civic responsibility, to go beyond being a space that commissions work for the public.”To this end, he sat down with Tamara McCaw, the Shed’s chief civic programme officer, and came up with one of the opening programme’s most radical commissions, involving three years of work in local schools and building on foundations laid down by Poots during the three years he was director of the Park Avenue Armory. It is called Maze and features a dance company led by Reggie Gray and made up of dancers, spotted and trained via the Shed’s FlexNYC programme, from low‑income neighbourhoods across the city.What is extraordinary about this show is the way Poots and McCaw have devised it as a sort of self-perpetuating commission. “Tamara said, ‘Why don’t we make a programme that is three-dimensional, so that the kids become teachers? Because they can do it already and they teach other kids in the community for free. So why don’t we formalise it: pay them for it, train them, almost become their company management, and make that part of the commission?’ That’s a project and kids in three years will be able to learn flex and join the company.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a60095c4e0e4fa970a98c8cb4e47b5159e4f25/0_177_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=166b706916ae9465d6ec8f2adbc3b58d","title":"big picture surreal portrait iranian desert gohar dashti","story":"Gohar Dashti’s take on the aftermath of the Iran‑Iraq war captures her nation’s ongoing sense of traumaThe photographer Gohar Dashti was born in 1980 in Ahvaz, a city in south-west Iran, near the border with Iraq. For the first 10 years of her life, her home was a battlefield in the brutal war between the neighbouring states. She spent many childhood nights in an air-raid shelter and she looked on as the place that was all she knew was reduced to rubble. Dashti’s work has always focused on the legacy of conflict, a fallout that continues around Ahvaz both physically – the rivers are poisoned, the wheat fields barren – and psychologically.From her earliest work a decade ago, Dashti has approached this post-conflict history not as a documentary photographer, but as a conceptual artist. She grew sick, she has said, of foreign photojournalism – women in chadors brandishing machine guns. Instead, she wanted to use her pictures to locate the more intractable insecurity that she recognised all around her. She started staging pictures that juxtaposed the expectations of normal life events – celebrations of weddings or birthdays – with the ever-present detritus of war.In the series of pictures she called Stateless, made in 2014 and 2015, she developed this idea with surreal portraits in the Iranian desert. The pictures were intended as metaphors of her country’s ongoing trauma for the million Iranian lives lost in the conflict, but also those millions more who have been displaced in the region’s subsequent wars – Iran has accepted more than 950,000 refugees in recent years, mostly from Afghanistan. This picture – a couple clinging to each other with all their worldly goods exposed under the hot sun – is emblematic of that latter reality: “Sky becomes the ceiling and mountains the walls of their new home,” Dashti says, “because nature is the only place that shelters these people, an everlasting refuge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1f683c32488c4f3d8a1489639c827018e2fdb4c/1_0_2040_1225/master/2040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dec4b3a8f7de36cfafaed2db6bcc29c1","title":"as the toll of australias frontier brutality keeps climbing truth telling is long overdue","story":"The myth of benign, peaceful settlement persists today – even as historians reveal a far more sinister picture • The Killing Times: the massacres of Aboriginal people Australia must confront • A massacre map of the frontier wars – interactive A friend sent me a photograph he’d taken in north-west Queensland of the memorial to the Kalkadoon warriors who, in 1884, fought what was perhaps the biggest battle against government forces to unfold on this continent.Local oral history, black and white, has it that dozens of Indigenous fighters were shot dead after they charged native police contingents under the command of Sub-Inspector FC Urquhart at Battle Mountain, about 60km from Cloncurry.My friend’s photograph of the monument, featuring the face of a warrior, arrived at the tail end of a protracted period of outrage from politicians about the vandalism of public statues of colonial English fellows, James Cook and Lachlan Macquarie, who were both responsible for extreme violence against Australia’s Indigenes.These were “cowardly, criminal” acts, we were told. As the rhetoric of indignation boiled over, the then prime minister even labelled the vandalism a “deeply disturbing act of Stalinism”.But beyond the objections of local blackfellas who are conversant with the Battle Mountain conflict’s critical place in the pantheon of Indigenous continental resistance, equivalent opprobrium never greets the regular desecration of that memorial on the Mount Isa-Cloncurry Road.Indeed, as the photograph sent by my mate made clear, the memorial, in his words, “continues to provide Queensland-style sporting opportunities to local shooters”. It’s little surprise, really during the 1990s, when the monument was erected, some lark even destroyed it with gelignite.While any search for moral equivalence over the vandalism of monuments to black and white heroes is insoluble, the potential for their use as historic metaphor is nonetheless irresistible: daubing the words “murderer” and “change the date” on the statues of our colonial heroes, illegal as it is, would seem to be freighted with quite different intent to blowing up and repeatedly shooting up the static image of an Aboriginal warrior.One, it seems to me at least, is more Stalinist. Not to mention colonially consistent. Quite like the manner by which Australia has told itself the history of the violent colonial and post-federation frontier – a story that, for 200-plus years, has had as ballast a trope of benign continental European settlement featuring benevolent, enlightened governors, understanding and compassionate settlers and Indigenous people who just “died off” or somehow wandered into near extinction.A critical part of this trope (the progeny at best, of an acute historical narcolepsy and at worst, wilful national ignorance) has been the efforts of our earliest myth makers to diminish the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were killed defending their lands or otherwise murdered, with cordite and lead, cold steel, poison, sickness and deprivation born of war.The Australian Museum estimates that pre-European invasion in 1788, about 750,000 Indigenous people (representing some 700 language groups) inhabited the continent that would become Australia. This figure may well be an underestimate.Little over a century later, by federation in 1901, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island population had diminished to some 117,000. Black-white warfare and organised massacres, no matter how you define them, with police, British soldiers, native police, militia and raiding parties as the perpetrators, accounted for many tens of thousands of deaths. Inidual acts of violence – including shootings, poisonings, torture and illegal incarceration – killed many more. Battle wounds, starvation (owing to the depletion of traditional hunting grounds) and disease – all of which can also be directly linked to invasion and frontier conflict – killed countless others.Yet the historiographic confect of benign, peaceful settlement and the unexplained “passing” or “extinction” of the “natives” pervaded well into the 1960s, replete with the deception that very few Aboriginal people died violently during pastoral and urban expansion and dispossession. Things began to change with the emergence of a new, more inquisitive, less empire-centric cohort of historians and writers who, not content with the Anglophile colonial trope of terra nullius and benevolence to the Indigenes, began to commit truth to the page.It is just over 50 years since the anthropologist William Stanner, in his 1968 Boyer lectures, lamented the “great Australian silence” in our white settlement narrative.It is a structural matter, a view from a window which has been carefully placed to exclude a whole quadrant of the landscape. What may well have begun as a simple forgetting of other possible views turned, under habit and over time, into something like a cult of forgetfulness practised on a national scale.As the historian Anna Clark points out, Stanner’s words acted as something of a propellant, if not a challenge – to a nation and its history writers.His lectures profoundly influenced historians partly because of the image he captured: for a practice based on documentation, archiving and storytelling, silence is a compelling idea. And a whole-scale silence … indicated a bold reimagining of a national historiography on Stanner’s part.Truth telling about frontier violence, including the stories of dozens of massacres that killed hundreds of Aboriginal people, was happening pre-Stanner. But its proponents were mostly lone voices who were often denigrated or marginalised – they included the Danish journalist and environmentalist Carl Feilberg, who took on (to his detriment) colonial Queensland over its mass killings of first inhabitants.Indigenous people were themselves taking on the authorities from the late 19th century, highlighting mass murder and general maltreatment and oppression. Witness the 1938 Day of Mourning in Sydney (timed to protest against the official sesquicentenary celebrations of the first fleet’s arrival) organised by the Aborigines Progressive Association, and its declaration:The 26th January, 1938, is not a day of rejoicing for Australia’s Aborigines. It is a day of mourning. This festival of 150 years’ so-called ‘progress’ in Australia commemorates also 150 years of misery and degradation imposed upon the original native inhabitants by the white invaders of this country.In the 1920s Anthony Martin Fernando, an Aboriginal man, protested widely in Europe, including in front of Australia House on the Strand in London, against the violence inflicted on his Indigenous brothers and sisters.And there was also Douglas Grant, the Indigenous massacre survivor who served the empire in the first world war and afterwards argued vociferously for Aboriginal rights in the wake of the 1928 Coniston massacre, while his experience was already being unfairly written along the lines of that of another famous black man, Bennelong, as the tragic morality tale of a racial outcast who fell between the cracks of two worlds.Anna Clark points out there is no clear seam in historiography to chart a precise segue from the “great Australian silence” to historical truth telling. She quotes the esteemed scholar Ann Curthoys, who has written extensively about Stanner: “There is neither complete silence before 1968, nor was it completely ended afterwards.”In the 1970s and 1980s a number of historians – among them Henry Reynolds, Marilyn Lake and Richard Broome – began focusing on frontier violence, using the colonial records, newspaper archives and family histories (including generational oral accounts of killings).Reynolds is acknowledged as the first Australian historian to make a calculated continental estimate of the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who died violently in Australian frontier conflict. In his 1981 book, The Other Side of the Frontier, and after at least a decade’s research Reynolds estimated the figure at about 20,000.It’s a figure I’ve referenced numerous times since about 2010 when writing about frontier history, and one that was for decades roundly – but unfairly – condemned by some reactionaries and historians of the right as a gross inflation. But subsequent scholarship, not least by the Queenslanders Raymond Evans and Robert Ørsted-Jensen, has rendered Reynolds’ figure conservative, perhaps by a multiple of three or four – or, if deaths attributable to disease and deprivation are included, by many times more.It’s instructive speaking today to Reynolds – who is, to my mind, the living Australian historian who has done the most to uncover and highlight white Australia’s violent foundations – about his early research and how he arrived at the 20,000 figure.He explains how he began researching The Other Side of the Frontier in 1970, while teaching at James Cook University in north Queensland. He began with local sources (the university then had no library to speak of), primarily the archive of the Port Denison Times of 1863 in the newspaper offices at Bowen.In Meanjin he wrote:White memories of racial violence have more often been expunged than preserved, while the decimating impact of disease and deprivation has often been accepted as a comprehensive explanation of a rapidly declining indigenous population. There is a very old belief that settlement was uniquely peaceful which can be traced back to the earliest writing on Australian colonisation.This was a historian awake to the national implications of his source material, treading with understandable care, though not in fear, and embarking on a long journey of archival discovery.Another decade of work led to The Other Side of the Frontier, 10 years in which Reynolds “nationalised” his research, “looking all over Australia at Indigenous frontier conflict deaths, researching in every relevant public library and state archive, including the colonial records. I also researched at the British Library and the Royal Commonwealth Society in London. During that period I read almost everything conceivable that was available in the archives and the newspapers ...“I felt it incumbent, as somebody who’d done research of such scope and breadth, to make some sort of public assessment of the number of Indigenous deaths in frontier conflict continent-wide. I also, in researching the book, counted all of the Europeans who were killed.“My research led me to propose that the number killed was at least 20,000 Aborigines. At the time I felt that it was risky to put a figure on it because I anticipated that others – historians, but particularly the culture warriors – would heavily criticise me for that. I thought it was going out on a limb. But that is the conclusion I arrived at and that is what I published.“Of course, in the decades since then, a number of others have done significant research on the numbers, utilising new archival material and other information and it is obvious that the figure of 20,000 is no longer adequate. It must be more. The figure must be significantly higher.”Reynolds speaks of the significance of Evans and  Ørsted-Jensen’s research on the numbers of killings in colonial Queensland.Based on an extrapolation of native police documentation, they estimated (conservatively) that as many as 60,000 Aboriginal people died in frontier violence in Queensland alone.The national implications of the figure are profound the wars that raged across this continent from 1788 did, it seem, claim more Indigenous lives than 62,000 Australian service personnel who died in the first world war.Evans says their figure “has been assessed from the fullest spread of the data and a very careful, reductive reading of existing casualty figures”.He says: “It was mathematically assessed in the most cautious way. Although the total may seem radical it was achieved by a highly conservative methodology and it is hard to see that the number could be any lower than this.“The average death rate for native police attacks is around 11 and for private settler assaults around nine, making both fall well within the ambit of what is presently considered as a ‘massacre’ – but there were thousands of such ‘dispersals’ in Queensland alone.”Ørsted-Jensen says the “higher level of violence in Queensland is, in our opinion, due solely to comparatively higher numbers of Indigenous people and tribes in that colony”.“Yet probably Queensland is the only state which can provide material useful for the calculation of casualty estimates, the reason being that Queensland ran a government-funded force for 50 years, leaving us a small yet significant sequential series of records of conflict per police patrol.”Ørsted-Jensen and Evans agree that, based on their Queensland calculations, “nationally the Australian frontier conflict during the 19th and into the early decades of the 20th century inflicted a death toll on Indigenous people probably no less than 100,000”.Evans says: “Coincidentally, this figure is very close to the total death rate for Australian troops in all foreign military engagements combined.Reynolds says: “One has to take very seriously this great expansion of the accepted Aboriginal death rate in Queensland, based on the findings of Robert and Ray, given that the native police were roaming the countryside up there for 50 years ... remembering, however, that Queensland is quite unique in some ways because it is a place where settlers were given self-government, away from imperial restraint, when such a huge area of the territory was still in Aboriginal hands.”He points out that official Australian commemoration for those who died in service in foreign wars includes many thousands killed as a result of disease and accident. By implication, he says, the official estimates of Indigenous deaths in the frontier wars should include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died from indirect consequences of conflict such as disease and hunger.This, potentially, adds many more thousands to even the most conservative estimates of Indigenous people killed in frontier conflicts.“The large and erse Aboriginal groups of the Kimberley still refer to the colonisation period from the early 1880s right through to the 1920s as ‘the killing times’,” Owen says.“Many of the killings were large-scale in what were called punitive expeditions, shooting Aboriginal people on sight after a colonist or prize stock had been killed. Notable recorded massacres followed the killing of miner Fred Marriot in July 1886, pastoralist John Durack in October 1886, George Barnett in July 1888, George Why at Mowla Bluff in 1916 and Fred Hay in the 1926 Forrest River massacre.“However most of the killing was smaller scale (twos and threes) simply to remove Aboriginal people, usually the senior males, from the presence of cattle or to obtain Aboriginal women.”Owen recounts the notorious cruelty of some Kimberley pioneering colonists, including Jack Carey, who, between 1919 and 1924, “threatened most Aboriginal people he met” and “shot and burnt large numbers of men, women and even children”.“There appeared no limit to his pettiness. Carey once shot three Indigenous stockmen dead because they had left the goat yard gate open.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bdae5cd1ce3cf788429d38d53f2f6221be84e2/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd389641fb60b3573fe3c3960b55dc7","title":"sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras in pictures","story":"A selection of images from the 41st annual parade, the theme of which was ‘fearless’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46a59b3570c8e6e5217979436e641ddccea7712/0_1814_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50f7450d3e8ac2c63b50199e4ea0141f","title":"non binary trans author nominated for womens prize for fiction","story":"Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi, who does not identify as male or female, among 16 books longlisted for the £30,000 awardThe Women’s prize for fiction has nominated a non-binary transgender author for the first time in its 27-year history, on a 16-book longlist featuring a previous winner, seven debuts and last year’s Booker prize winner.Thirty-one-year-old Nigerian author Akwaeke Emezi is nominated for their first novel, Freshwater. Described as “remarkable” in the ’s review, Freshwater is a coming-of-age story following a child, Ada, who is born filled with Igbo spirits as a challenge from a deity to Ada’s Catholic father.Emezi, who does not identify as male or female and lives in Brooklyn, is one of seven first-time authors up for the £30,000 prize, on a longlist that s the city streets of Lagos and remote Northumberland, the US-Mexico border and ancient Greece.“It is a historic moment,” Professor Kate Williams, chair of judges, told the . “We’re very careful not to Google the authors while judging, so we did not know. But the book found great favour among us, it is wonderful. They are an incredibly talented author and we’re keen to celebrate them.”She said the judges were not aware of Emezi’s gender identity when they selected Freshwater, but they did check that Emezi was happy to be longlisted before the announcement.“Fiction, right from the beginning of the novel in the 18th century, has been there to explore identity,” said Williams. “Novels are deep explorations of personality, identity and what makes a person. That is what Freshwater, and all the books on our longlist, are doing.”Big-name nominees include Anna Burns, who is longlisted for her novel Milkman, last year’s Man Booker prize-winner about the relationship between a Northern Irish teenager and an abusive paratrooper during the Troubles. Seventy-five-year-old Pat Barker, who was nominated for the inaugural prize for her 1995 novel The Ghost Road, is longlisted for only the second time for The Silence of the Girls, a retelling of the Iliad from the perspective of the women. And English writer Sarah Moss is nominated for the first time for her novella Ghost Wall, following a teenager’s terrifying experience while on a trip to Northumberland with her strict father.American author Madeline Miller, who won the prize in 2013 for her debut The Song of Achilles, is again nominated for her follow-up, Circe, while Diana Evans, who won the now-obsolete new writers category in 2005 for her debut 26a, is chosen for her third novel Ordinary People. And Normal People, Sally Rooney’s bestselling second novel is also named – the latest prize nomination for a book that won the Costa novel of the year and is longlisted for this year’s Dylan Thomas prize.Writers from the US have won the prize most often – nine times – and they dominate the longlist, with six authors nominated: Tayari Jones for An American Marriage, Bernice L McFadden for Praise Songs for the Butterflies Melissa Broder for The Pisces and three debuts: Lillian Li for Number One Chinese Restaurant Kelleigh Greenberg-Jephcott for Swan Song and Yvonne Battle-Felton for Remembered.Other debuts include Nigerian author Oyinkan Braithwaite for her darkly funny novel My Sister the Serial Killer and Romanian Sophie van Llewyn for her novella Bottled Goods. And Mexican author Valeria Luiselli is nominated for the first time for Lost Children Archive, which follows one family making a car journey south from New York to Arizona, while the news is reporting on migrant families from Mexico desperately trying to reach the US.Williams, joined on the judging panel by journalist and critic Arifa Akbar, columnist Dolly Alderton, women’s rights campaigner Leyla Hussein and tech entrepreneur Sarah Wood, said the longlist was shaped with “passionate debate” and features “deep engagements with female and sexual identity, and real engagement with tyranny, both sexual and political. And of course, amazing storytelling and gripping plots.” The Women’s prize for fiction was first established in 1992, the year after no female authors were shortlisted for the Booker prize. It was first awarded in 1996 to the late Helen Dunmore.This is the first year prize has enjoyed charitable status. Previously sponsored by Orange until 2012, then Baileys until 2017, the prize now receives financial support from a group of brands, as well as appealing to iniduals for donations between £1,000 to £5,000 on a new patron scheme.The shortlist will be announced 29 April, with the winner revealed on 5 June.The Silence of the Girls by Pat BarkerRemembered by Yvonne Battle-FeltonMy Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan BraithwaiteThe Pisces by Melissa BroderMilkman by Anna BurnsFreshwater by Akwaeke EmeziOrdinary People by Diana EvansSwan Song by Kelleigh Greenberg-JephcottAn American Marriage by Tayari JonesNumber One Chinese Restaurant by Lilian LiBottled Goods by Sophie van LlewynLost Children Archive by Valeria LuiselliPraise Songs for the Butterflies by Bernice L McFaddenCirce by Madeline MillerGhost Wall by Sarah MossNormal People by Sally Rooney"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b38aa896f03a85d4648d92ccca635c669a4cf4f/0_0_4665_2799/master/4665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbf1321d166d0c683ffa3e64fd644436","title":"a powerful argument for radical change readers respond to guardian concrete week","story":"From highlighting favourite Brutalist gems to suggesting construction alternatives, readers have had lots to say about our concrete coverageThis week  Cities has been investigating the contentious issue of concrete. While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images. We looked at each one, and although we couldn’t include them all we were hugely heartened by your passion and knowledge.

The neighbourhood now bustles with camera-toting millennials, and drives huge consumer spending.The experiment was hailed a success and touted as a model of Chinese urban development. In the north-eastern city of Harbin, the central historic district of Lao Daowai was chosen for similar treatment.Walk Lao Daowai’s streets today and you’ll find a kind of gentrified nostalgia: the old residences have been demolished and replaced with remakes in the “Chinese-baroque” style (two-storey stone houses with European exteriors and Chinese interior courtyards). Shops peddle kitschy Russian memorabilia and cafes offer lattes and sourdough bread, hoping to attract young consumers with time to spare and cash to spend.But unlike Xintiandi, Lao Daowai is eerily quiet. During my visit it was empty but for a handful of wandering tourists.“Young people don’t really go to Lao Daowai,” says Ye Xia, a PhD student in comparative literature at Heilongjiang University in Harbin. “What’s the point? What is there to do? I would only want to go hang out a place where there are other young people.”It illustrates the challenges faced by Harbin, the once-thriving capital of Heilongjiang province, which has been rocked by an exodus of young talent attracted to the more successful likes of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Across the north-east Dongbei industrial region, of which Harbin is part, more than 2 million people left between 2000 and 2010.Dongbei, a trade hub with Russia in the 1920s and home to an influx of Jewish immigrants on the eve of the second world war, became under Mao a powerful manufacturing base dubbed China’s “eldest son” because it shouldered the nation’s economy. But it has suffered in recent decades as the steel and coal industries have declined, and is now referred to by the less enviable term “rust belt of China”.Harbin does not feel like a city in decline. On Central Avenue, the longest pedestrian street in China, an elaborate ice-sculpture advertises the mobile phone company Huawei and an H\u0026ampM store sells its wares inside a Russian baroque building, one of the vestiges of the city’s varied architectural past. And the Songbei district, a 738 sq km new town that was industrial wasteland only a decade ago, is now packed with residential high-rises, office towers and the world’s largest indoor ski resort.This slowing in the face of a shifting economy is new territory for Harbin, and for China. Indeed, the city’s challenge is similar to that faced by many post-industrial cities in the west, such as northern UK cities like Newcastle and Middlesborough or the US rust belt cities of Detroit and Pittsburgh: how to prevent, or manage, decline.Harbin is not quite in the same situation as a city like Detroit, where the population fell dramatically over the second half of the 20th century, says Ren Xuefei, professor of global urban studies at Michigan State University. In contrast, Harbin’s population of 5 million is still growing. “Detroit’s urban master plans aspire to shrink the city and make it more compact,” says Ren. “In Harbin, the aspiration is to expand and make the city larger.”Nevertheless, an anxious national government has taken note that Harbin is lagging behind its peers. It has drawn up a plan to revitalise the old north-east industrial bases, and announced in 2016 that it would pump 1.6tn yuan (£183bn) into the north-eastern provinces in the next three years.The municipal government, meanwhile, wants to rebrand the city as a cultural capital. In both China and the west, the “creative economy” – the role of arts and culture – has been raised as a means of reviving post-industrial cities.Harbin has pinned its hopes on large architectural projects such as Songbei, a newly built area north of the Songhua River modelled after Shanghai’s booming Pudong financial district, and renovating neighbourhoods such as Lao Daowai, named a “preserved historical area” in 2016. But it has struggled to match the appeal of China’s more attractive coastal cities. The Lao Daowai regeneration is a “mimicry of Xintiandi,” according to Ren, “yearning to become the cosmopolitan mini-Shanghai that lies beyond its reach.”“Most of my friends who leave Harbin will not come back,” says Ye. She wants to work as a high school teacher after graduation in Harbin, she would earn 3,000 yuan per month, whereas in a southern city like Shenzhen, she could fetch a monthly salary of up to 10,000 yuan. The disposable income of Harbin’s residents is only a fraction of that in Shanghai, 28,000 yuan a year (£3,160) compared to 48,000 (£5,420).The big architecture projects are similarly hamstrung. In Songbei, the city commissioned a new opera house, a sprawling white structure of glass and aluminium designed by the star architect Ma Yansong that opened in 2016. The building is part of an effort to rebrand Harbin as China’s “music city”, which also includes luring visitors during warmer seasons by hosting an annual Harbin summer music festival.More effective than top-down interventions, perhaps, are broad cultural policies that can retain young talent, to keep them from fleeing south in search of better opportunities and to draw them back to the city to innovate.Here Harbin can draw on lessons learned by post-industrial cities elsewhere. In the US, while “high-profile cultural centres or ballparks may have dramatic appeal, more important is sustained investment in education, job-training and university partnerships to generate new employment opportunities,” according to Elihu Rubin, professor of urbanism at Yale School of Architecture.Li Gang, an independent music producer from Harbin, remains hopeful about the potential of Harbin’s cultural industries. Since he arrived as a university student five years ago, independent music performances have proliferated from a couple to a couple hundred, and ticket prices have risen from 10 to 100 yuan.“A few years ago, the young people I met were mostly ‘Beijing drifters’,” says Li, referring to people who migrate to China’s capital in search of a better life. “But in the last few years I’ve had friends open their eyes to new possibilities and come back to try to run startups and businesses back here in Harbin.“Perhaps I’d leave the city if I changed my job. But outside Harbin, the rice and beer simply isn’t as delicious.” The rest of the city will need more than that to convince them to stay.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":null,"title":"climate change emergency westminster","story":"Westminster’s lacklustre approach is incredible. We need nothing short of a transformation of the way we live our livesMPs debated climate change in the Commons chamber last week for the first time in two years. It was our first opportunity since September 2016 to talk about the biggest and most urgent crisis humanity has ever faced. Just 40 MPs showed up. This absenteeism speaks volumes. Even as we’ve sweated through a record-breaking February, as wildfires tear through our ancient woodlands, as insect and wildlife populations collapse around us, the words “climate change” are scarcely whispered in the corridors of Whitehall.On the opposition benches, while many MPs grasp the severity of this situation, their parties’ policies are littered with impossible inconsistencies. We cannot tackle climate change and build new runways, or prop up North Sea oil and gas, or spend billions on new roads. And we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant – that somehow the Earth will expand to meet our voracious appetite for new stuff.The world’s top scientists say we need to cut emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. But during that same period, the global economy is set to nearly triple in size. It would be hard enough to decarbonise existing levels of production and consumption in just a few decades. To do it three times over is nigh on impossible. To pursue never-ending economic growth – or even to keep things ticking along as they are – is to gamble with the fate of humanity. We need nothing short of a transformation of the way we live our lives – and the way we measure progress.In the US, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has reinvigorated the idea of a Green New Deal – an initiative I was proud to have co-founded 10 years ago here in the UK. It takes its inspiration from Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s, which used massive investment in jobs and infrastructure to pull the US out of the Great Depression.In 2019, we face an even bigger challenge. To avoid climate catastrophe, we must go beyond what is considered politically possible. A Green New Deal would mobilise resources on a scale unprecedented in peacetime, to tackle the climate emergency and address spiralling inequality. It would involve huge investment in clean energy, warm homes and affordable public transport – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would rebuild once proud communities that have been hollowed out by deindustrialisation and austerity, allowing them to thrive as part of a collective endeavour to protect the planet. And it would protect and restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks like forests, wild places, soils and oceans.To do this, we must be able to leverage whatever finance is necessary to tackle the crisis. This is not a Trumpian border wall emergency – this is a real emergency. Critics might denounce such a plan as fantasy politics – but I ask them, with just 11 years left to halve global climate emissions, what is your alternative?Young people understand what’s needed to secure their futures. Last month, they went on school strike across the country to protest about government inaction on climate change. In our cities and towns, Green councillors have persuaded more than 25 local authorities to declare a climate emergency – and now schools and universities are doing the same. These are some of the most inspirational and hopeful acts I’ve seen in years. And where the people lead, politicians must follow.Parliament must now declare a climate emergency. It must debate climate change regularly. It must develop the laws necessary to implement a Green New Deal and climate-proof every piece of legislation. And the government must ensure climate change is a priority in all departmental and cabinet decision-making. But government and parliament will only act if we tell them to. So talk about climate breakdown – to your friends, your family, your neighbours and your colleagues. Join the school strikes. Join peaceful direct action initiatives like Extinction Rebellion. Write to your MP. Write to your councillors. Write to your banks. This is an emergency.

As a result, when she was sent the Facebook post from the Coal Oil Point Reserve, she had her doubts.“I was really skeptical,” she said.But after asking staff from the reserve to go out and take more pictures of the features that distinguish a hoodwinker sunfish from an ocean sunfish – a flap iding the rounded clavus that the fish has in place of a tail, bony structures along the clavus and the scale structure – it was clear that this was a hoodwinker.“When the pictures came through, they were so so clear, I just could not believe it, it was a mix of disbelief and excitement,” she said.As to why this particular fish made its way so far north – potentially more than 4,000 miles (6,800km) from home – that is unclear.“It could just be a lost sunfish, or it could be we don’t understand the distribution yet,” she said. “Then of course there is the whole issue around climate change, we can’t conclude anything from just one specimen, but of course it is the question.”Researchers from the University of Santa Barbara collected samples from the dead fish, including one bound for Nyegaard’s research. The genetic samplewill enable her to check if the Californian hoodwinker is from the same population as those off New Zealand.The genetic analysis will be done by Nyegaard’s sister Dr Mette Nyegaard, a geneticist at Aarhus University in Denmark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ec7622f1ac110c4a01f3891ea166f4f14391f13/0_855_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1c8cf8aaa579ed339dfbc64e0c7c205","title":"their birthright is being lost new zealanders fret over polluted rivers","story":"Dairy boom has coincided with decline in water quality, leaving two-thirds of rivers unsafe for swimmingIt has been a classic summer in New Zealand: hot days, barbecues on the beach and lazy afternoon games of cricket. But dozens of beaches, rivers and lakes have been closed to the public owing to pollution from farming.Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Fish \u0026amp Game New Zealand, said the survey showed people were fed up with the failure of successive governments to tackle the pollution problem. “Kiwis are extremely worried that they are losing their ability to swim, fish and gather food from their rivers, lakes and streams,” he said. “People see those activities as their birthright, but over the last 20 years that right is being lost because the level of pollution in waterways has increased as farming intensifies.”According to the environment ministry, two-thirds of all rivers are now unswimmable and three-quarters of New Zealand’s native freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction. New Zealanders are now encouraged to check their local council websites for public health warnings before heading out for a day on the water. Declining water quality has coincided with a boom in New Zealand’s dairy industry – it is the largest exporter of dairy in the world. Cow effluent and fertiliser run-off are significant polluters of inland waterways, as are beef, sheep and deer farming. Mass deforestation and the extensive clearing of native wetlands has also played a significant role.According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Science (Niwa), there is no doubt that the growth in pastoral farming, particularly dairy farming, is the main culprit for declining river water quality over the last 20 years. Rivers and streams in dairy country such as the Waikato, Southland and Canterbury are the most polluted in the country, Niwa says.Dairy stock require rich, green pastures to produce the best milk, which has led to a proliferation of irrigation and fertiliser use. As the dairy herd has increased, their nitrate-rich effluent has flowed into the waterways, asphyxiating ecosystems, causing toxic algae blooms, making indigenous food sources inedible and making it unsafe for people to swim in, drink or sometimes even touch the water.In 2016, four people died and 5,000 fell ill as a result of a gastroenteritis outbreak in the North Island town of Havelock North. The probable cause was sheep faeces contaminating the town’s water supply, a government inquiry found. “I really thought that once people started dying, that things would change and people would take notice. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case,” said Prof Russell Death, an ecologist, in a keynote address at the New Zealand Freshwater Science Society’s conference last month.“It still seems to me that water quality is not improving. If it is, it’s only very, very slowly improving. To my mind, there’s no convincing evidence that we’ve turned around the decline that’s been going on over the last 20 years.”The Labour coalition government, led by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has pledged to make the country’s rivers and lakes swimmable within a generation, describing it as a “birthright” for New Zealanders. It is a more ambitious goal than that of the previous National government, which promised only to make them “wadeable”. But action has been slow, and experts say it has taken a back seat to housing and entrenched social welfare issues.The environment minister, David Parker, caused an outcry last year when he told a current affairs show that New Zealand had too many cows, raising the possibility of a cap on numbers. Parker has since backed away from this statement and clarified that a nutrient run-off cap is more likely. Encouraging changes to land use in favour of more cropping and horticulture is also a government priority.“There are some people who are in denial,” Parker said in a TV interview. “Now, those people will have to be regulated to do the right thing, because they may not be willing to do it voluntarily. We’re actually not going to subsidise land use change, but we will enable it through the new technologies that we are willing to subsidise to bring forward.”Chris Lewis, the dairy chair for the Federated Farmers of New Zealand, acknowledged that the industry was “far from perfect” and said it was keen to change, with improvements expected within the next 10 years.Taylor, the Fish \u0026amp Game chief, said legislation was needed. “While many farmers do understand the need for action and are making the necessary changes to how they use their land, there are still significant numbers who are refusing to follow their example,” he said. “They have to be made to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960447e65eb9ce9aaa9220981a2cb5d914dfcd69/0_144_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae2b2baa4fa21a5313a52c820dcad3a6","title":"liverpool mohamed salah everton jurgen klopp","story":"The solidity of Jürgen Klopp’s team in defence has come at a cost in attack and against Everton they passed up five decent chances in a draw that kept them off the topAnother Sunday away against a local rival, another goalless draw, and another point that will either be what ended up winning Liverpool the league or that ended up costing them the title. That’s the problem with games like these: it can never be said an away point in such an environment is a bad result, but equally too many of such outcomes could be costly. And again there is the underlying thought that something has gone wrong with the forward line, that just when Liverpool could have done with a spark of magic to snatch a win from a hard-fought game, the fire has dimmed.The positive way to look at it is that, although Manchester City are now top of the table, they have the harder fixtures to come, most notably the away game at Manchester United. In that sense, the point gained here is significant in that, had Liverpool lost, City could have drawn that game and still won the league even if Liverpool win every remaining game (barring a remarkable swing of goal-difference). No game is necessarily straightforward, of course, and as the finish line draws closer, the slightest molehill can loom as a great mountain, but this was probably the hardest away game Liverpool had remaining.But on the other side of the equation is the fact that Liverpool have now drawn five of their last seven games in all competitions, and failed to score in three of their last four. Jürgen Klopp was dismissive after Wednesday’s 5-0 win over Watford of talk of anxiety but the fluency of that game was out of keeping with Liverpool’s general form since the turn of the year. The forward line is not flowing as it did at this stage last season.The foot injury that caused Roberto Firmino to start on the bench did not help, of course, but there are issues here that go beyond one switch of personnel. Most obviously, there is the form of Mohamed Salah. It was generally accepted that he could not do again what he did last season, that that was a zenith that was never likely to be hit again, but after a few weeks when he did touch those heights again, he has scored just once in his last seven games and looked distinctly tentative here. There were occasional flashes of the old brilliance, but for much of the game Salah played the way Jordan Henderson’s critics believe he plays. So too, unfortunately for Liverpool, did Jordan Henderson.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThere were heavy touches and oddly misplaced passes but, most critically, there were three missed chances. Conventional wisdom has it that the time to worry is if a forward stops getting chances and perhaps that is true, but there must equally be concern not just that Salah missed, but the way in which he missed.The first opportunity had the makings of a classic Salah goal as he shuffled in from the right and worked the ball on to his left foot. But rather than opening his body and arcing the ball into the top corner as he has done so often, he scooped ended up scooping it tamely at Jordan Pickford.Then there were the two occasions when space opened in front of him and he had a run into the box. But both times there was a momentary hesitation, none of the smoothness of a confident player. In the first instance his effort was well-saved by Pickford in the second Michael Keane made was able to get across and make a vital block.It is not just Salah, of course. Sadio Mané, who has carried the forward line recently with six goals in his previous six Premier League games, never seems quite as comfortable in the middle as he does on the flank. Divock Origi struggled to impose himself. And then there is that midfield and the lack of creativity that has been exposed repeatedly this season – away against Paris Saint-Germain, Napoli and Manchester United.Could Klopp have pushed his full-backs on further, could he have tried to utilise the crossing ability of Trent Alexander-Arnold in the way he did against Watford? Perhaps but, especially away from home, Klopp has been conservative in how he has used the full-backs. That lies behind the improved defensive record – only just over half a goal conceded per game this season – but there is a cost to that solidity.And the fact is Liverpool did have the better of the game. Salah had his three chances. It took a lunging challenge from Lucas Digne to deny Fabinho late on. Joël Matip put a great headed chance wide. Five decent chances should be enough to win a game, and that suggests the issue was not a tactical one. The problem, rather, is that the forward line has lost its edge just at the wrong time – and that makes Klopp’s balancing act significantly harder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efecd4eae1cd431470a99c9f7aaea0aa6702bbe6/32_32_2459_1475/master/2459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5658fb75763bd4bc22d4ea8cde9a110","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekends action","story":"Mkhitaryan makes a timely return to form, Bournemouth set unwanted record and Wolves should snap up JiménezIt has not been easy for Alireza Jahanbakhsh to adapt to the Premier League during his first year in England, but the Iran international showed he can be a threat in Brighton’s vital win against Huddersfield. Jahanbakhsh was Brighton’s most enterprising player after being handed his fourth league start of the season, and he was unfortunate to be taken off moments before Florin Andone’s late winner. The 25‑year‑old winger, who has struggled since his £17m move from AZ Alkmaar, could have scored twice and will feel he played well enough to keep José Izquierdo on the bench when Chris Hughton’s side visit Crystal Palace this weekend. “I am hoping we are going to see more,” Hughton said. “He is a goalscorer and that is why we brought him in. You like to think that with Alireza in the team we can get more goals.” Jacob SteinbergCrystal Palace are the latest beneficiaries of Chelsea’s buy‑to‑let schemes. In putting his latest loan team 2-0 up at Burnley, Michy Batshuayi scored his second goal in three matches having been redirected from Valencia. Palace struggled for goals for the first half of the season while Roy Hodgson could not call upon a serviceable striker. Batshuayi has added cutting edge and thrust to help Palace pull away from the bottom three. His arrival has coincided with the revival of – and greater freedom for – Wilfried Zaha, who scored a superb goal at Turf Moor having previously contributed to Phil Bardsley putting through his own net. Maurizio Sarri is the second successive Chelsea manager to turn his nose up at Batshuayi after Antonio Conte, but with Álvaro Morata borrowed by Atlético Madrid and Gonzalo Higuaín lacking sharpness, the Belgian, despite his unpredictability, might have been a useful wild card. John BrewinIt is impossible to consider Liverpool’s recent form without using the B-word. Yes, a run of four draws in six league games is undeniably a blip. And, while there are worrying signs, it would be premature to use the other B-word. Teams have overcome far worse dips in form during the run-in to win the title, and nobody really knows whether Liverpool are bottling it or not. Their problem is easy to recognise and harder to resolve. They have stopped scoring away from home, with only three goals in the last five league games away from Anfield. The defence is still watertight, with Virgil van Dijk strolling through a nervous title race with a resting heart rate, and that is vital because it means one goal will be enough to win most games. With Roberto Firmino subdued for most of the season and Mo Salah not at his best, it might be time for Jürgen Klopp to think about temporarily breaking up the front three. Whatever he does tactically, one thing’s for sure: in the next two months, his considerable man-management skills are going to be tested like never before. Rob SmythFulham’s stint in the top flight will be short-lived. The club have accepted as much, with Scott Parker acknowledging there will be a period of restructuring in the summer. “Clubs change when they are relegated,” he said. “You go from the best league in the world, with all its billions of pounds, to the Championship.” Yet what is clear, even from a solitary glimpse of a Parker team, is Fulham will go down playing a brand of football more in keeping with the reputation forged while rising from the second tier. They were slick and adventurous for periods here, with some of those who had secured promotion revived by the caretaker manager’s presence. “I wouldn’t want to do it any other way,” Parker said when asked about reclaiming this team’s identity. “If someone from above told me to do something else, I’d have to say to them: ‘I’m not your guy,’ and wouldn’t carry on.” This whole campaign has been an anticlimax. Yet Fulham can still go out in style. Dominic FifieldReports of David de Gea’s decline have almost certainly been exaggerated, even if the goalkeeper was beaten twice by shots from outside the area at Old Trafford. That sounds damning, though you have to see the quality of the shots before coming to any conclusion. Even though De Gea got his hands to the first one from Yan Valery it was so powerfully struck he was still unable to keep it out of the net. The second, a free kick by James Ward-Prowse, was so perfectly executed the goalkeeper could not get near it. Even Ole Gunnar Solskjær was impressed by the visitors’ goals. “Their two goals, wow!” United’s caretaker manager said. “Two strikes of real quality.” Naturally Ralph Hasenhüttl agreed. “Valery is like Prowsey, they are both in fantastic shape in defence and attack. We scored two marvellous goals,” he said. Paul WilsonNewcastle would be particularly ill-served by a drop-off in form now given the reluctance of Rafael Benítez to consider his future until they are safe. Their insipid defeat at West Ham felt like a rude awakening after a major uptick over the previous month it was a reminder, too, that their record signing Miguel Almirón will not be able to solve everything. Almirón was painfully quiet, and comfortably outshone by West Ham’s Felipe Anderson and Manuel Lanzini. He will have days like this because, when all is said and done, the leap from Atlanta United and the Major League Soccer to England’s top flight is gigantic. “Of course, people need to be patient,” his teammate Isaac Hayden said. “You can see his talent and what he brings, but to do it on a consistent basis in the Premier League is a completely different thing. Realistically this is his pre-season still.” It was difficult to argue and Benítez may need more seasoned heads to see Newcastle over the line. Nick AmesQuite how influential and impressive Raúl Jiménez has been in his debut season in the Premier League seems to have gone a little unnoticed outside Wolverhampton. That might be good news for Nuno Espírito Santo as Wolves can trigger a €38m (£30m) option to sign the forward permanently from Benfica this summer, providing all parties agree to the switch. That fee for the Mexican, who has scored 11 goals and set up six more in the league, increasingly looks a snip. Jiménez, who possesses poise as well as power, again led the line imperiously alongside Diogo Jota as Wolves comfortably dispatched Cardiff to maintain their hopes of European football. Outside the top six, Jiménez is the ision’s leading scorer. He can seemingly do it all play the role of a battering ram, link play, pick out others and, most importantly, score.

I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

However, we would like to return to the UK to be with family as we no longer have any relatives in Australia. My husband is English and I am British. Unfortunately we have very limited finances but get an Australian pension with a UK top-up. We would like to buy a new-build house near to where my daughter lives in Sevenoaks in Kent. We have looked into the help-to-buy and home for life schemes and wondered if you think either might help us and whether we would be able to get a mortgage at our age.WLA You might be surprised to hear that several building societies in the UK no longer impose an age limit on their mortgage borrowers and there is one which puts the age you can be at the end of the mortgage term at 95. Most other lenders put this age at 80 so you would struggle to get a mortgage from them. But even if your age doesn’t form a barrier to getting a mainstream mortgage, the fact that you don’t have a recent UK credit history could well stand in your way. However, this may not be such an issue with lenders who offer lifetime mortgages – a form of equity release – which are increasingly being used by older borrowers who want to buy a new property to be closer to family and friends. Because the interest on a lifetime mortgage can be rolled up and added to the original loan – although it doesn’t have to be – there’s a much lower risk of default so whether you are a model borrower or not doesn’t matter so much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c633963e451cb28a3ea6d6717b679157e40410/0_29_4854_2912/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff9d12a9fdd9edd1d4a293ddc3143d98","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez new star us left help hindrance podcast","story":"All eyes are on Ocasio-Cortez, but what does her brand of politics actually mean for the Democrats as they head into the presidential elections next year? ’s Lauren Gambino reports from Washington.

The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, denied the money was a Brexit bribe and said it would be enough to have a “transformative” impact on areas that felt left behind.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, he refused to say how many towns would benefit, but pointed out that the cash would be allocated whatever happens in next week’s meaningful vote on the EU withdrawal bill.“This funding is there regardless of the outcome … there is no conditionality,” he said. “This funding is there to see that towns grow … and we leave no part of our UK left behind.”The prime minister said the Stronger Towns Fund, much of it allocated to the north of England and the Midlands, would go to areas that had not “shared the proceeds of growth”.May, who is also expected to announce post-Brexit guarantees on workers’ and trade union rights in the coming days, said £1bn had been allocated already, of which more than half would go to the north of England, where towns such as Wakefield, Doncaster and Wigan voted heavily for Brexit.About £322m will go to towns in the Midlands, where the leave vote in places such as Stoke-on-Trent, Mansfield and Wolverhampton was high. Nandy, the MP for Wigan and a former shadow minister, said towns such as hers had been “shamefully ignored for decades” and the new fund must represent the start of an overhaul in the government’s approach to investment.“If it is a one-off payment designed to help the prime minister ahead of a key Brexit vote, it will fail and confirm to people in our towns that the government is not serious in its commitment to our communities,” she said.Snell, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, one of the MPs who has been negotiating with the government about new guarantees for workers, said the money for his region would not even cover the cuts made by his local council.“Regardless of how much money the prime minister promises communities like the West Midlands, I will make up my mind on how I vote based on the terms of the deal,” he said. “There is no price on my vote. The West Midlands is getting £212m, which is a good starting point to address the problems we are facing but in context, that £212m for the whole region is less than the total amount that Stoke city council has had to cut from its budget in the last nine years because of austerity. So it is not a big windfall that will make everything right.”No 10 said communities would be given some say about how to spend the money in their towns via local enterprise partnerships. The remaining £600m will be available through a bidding process to communities in any part of the country, a sweetener to Conservative MPs who had demanded their areas receive equal treatment.Announcing the fund, May linked the new money directly to the leave votes from the towns it would benefit. “Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change. That must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control,” she said. “These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.”Conservative MPs were disconcerted that the pledge had been linked to securing the votes of Labour MPs. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, pushed the prime minister during PMQs last week for reassurance that towns such as his in Essex would be able to make the case for more funding.“I welcome that £600m has been pledged to towns across UK – like Harlow –with significant disadvantage and deprivation,” he said. “It is vital that this fund is not seen as pork-barrel politics, but a way for all poorer communities to benefit post-Brexit.”Brexiter MPs also expressed caution about the cash. Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, who previously voted against May’s deal, said: “What this money won’t do is buy any votes in parliament. I am determined to deliver a proper Brexit, which means fixing the backstop, while all the local Labour MPs are unapologetically in denial about the need to leave the EU at all.”Labour and campaigners for a second referendum dismissed May’s announcement. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the fund “smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation”.He said towns were struggling because of “a decade of cuts, including to council funding, and a failure to invest in businesses and our communities”. Labour would establish a network of regional development banks to finance growth in smaller towns, he said. “No Brexit bribery. Stable investment where it’s most needed.”Anna Soubry, part of the breakaway Independent Group, said it was “a desperate measure to buy votes” and compared it with the £1bn the DUP secured for Northern Ireland as part of its confidence and supply agreement.“Now Theresa May is so desperate to get votes for a bad EU withdrawal agreement she is relying on the same old trick,” Soubry said. “Voters will not be fooled, especially those in areas which voted leave and are now demanding a people’s vote because they know whichever way you do it, Brexit will harm their futures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64856b82bc0d73caa8b17a5bf0c4525ef4b5fdb9/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0abdef5a59ec76d95b5e1afa9f39b11","title":"cant change traffic lights swans cross road transport london","story":"My job as network manager for Transport for London sees me planning for and adjusting traffic signals to keep people movingI review a model for a traffic signal design in Greenwich town centre. The borough is working with us to make improvements for people walking or cycling. Computer models allow us to predict what will happen to traffic and for cyclists or pedestrians when we change traffic light times and road layouts. This means we can check if our designs are right before starting construction.I head out to Woolwich, where there is a new wide crossing to cater for more pedestrians. I want to make sure that some traffic signal timings I have adjusted are working properly. I’ve shortened the waiting time for pedestrians and ensured that buses can progress without getting held up too much. While I am reviewing the signals, a black cab driver pulls up to see what I am doing. He’s worried that I’m lost and wants to see if I need any help. It’s times like these that I’m reminded how odd I must look to others when I stand looking at traffic signals for a long period of time. Once I explain what I’m doing and how I’m trying to improve the timings, we talk about all of the traffic signals in different parts of London. He knows a lot and gives me some recommendations of where we can make improvements.Today’s visit goes quite smoothly, but when I went out to see some new traffic signals in Kidbrooke recently, a family of swans decided to cross the road, so I couldn’t test my timings until they reached their destination (another pond).I receive an enquiry from a motorist about traffic signals in Snaresbrook – they think they aren’t green for long enough. I check the traffic control system for any obvious faults, as well as our incident system in case there are any roadworks in the area. I can’t spot anything unusual, so I head to the junction to see what’s going on. Using detectors buried in the road, this junction adjusts its timings according to how much traffic it detects at any specific time. I find that a detector is faulty, so the lights are staying green for pedestrians for longer because they think that there are vehicles there when they are not. I report the fault and change the system timings until it’s repaired.I am working to improve bus reliability in Romford, using new technology that tells the traffic signals if a bus is running late against its schedule. How late the bus is running will affect what the traffic lights do to get it back on track. In just a second or two, the traffic light system will decide whether to keep the signals green for a bit longer or to turn them back quickly to ensure that the bus isn’t waiting too long.I arrive at the network management control centre. It is a big room with CCTV screens where everyone works to keep London moving during any events. Today, there is a taxi demonstration. I work with the police and the events team to ensure we know where the protest is taking place, so we can keep traffic flowing on alternative routes.If there is something unplanned, like a traffic collision or breakdown, we have to look at the wider area to change the traffic light timings to get everyone moving again. We help everyone, not just vehicles – for example, if I see lots of people struggling to cross the road after a big event, I can change the crossing timings temporarily until the crowd has cleared. It’s pretty fast-paced, but it’s great when you see on CCTV that the queue has gone.If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49039ba810e7e7e4c05c7aaa74db42821c2ddde9/0_201_5537_3323/master/5537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c8cbfe43d06447b87816f549fd463f","title":"one in five children under supervision orders harmed again within five years","story":"Study in England finds children placed with relatives have lower rates of return to courtAt least one in five children in England allowed to return to potentially dangerous homes under supervision orders are back in court within five years having been subjected to further significant harm, according to research.The study also found that professionals were deeply frustrated by the lack of powers available to help them keep vulnerable children safe, and wanted local authorities to be given “more teeth”.The study followed 19,296 children placed under supervision orders between 2010-11 and 2016-17.“Our study looked at the most vulnerable children in society who have experienced or are likely to experience significant harm as a result of the parenting they have received,” said Prof Judith Harwin, who led the Lancaster University study.“Numbers could be higher because it is likely that a proportion of children returned home to parents have not been captured by our study.”“Over the course of the four-year follow-up, an increased proportion of children were exposed to harm, indicating a deteriorating picture of parenting capacity,” Harwin said. “These are arguably treatable issues which, if public services and social welfare provision were better resourced, could readily be addressed.”The report is published at a critical time in family justice, with the number of children in care and supervision applications having more than doubled since 2007-08.Dr Bachar Alrouh, another of the report’s co-authors, said this had created significant pressures on family courts and children’s services. “Expectations have risen as resources have decreased to deal with rising demand,” he said.The recent Care Crisis Review found that families themselves were an underused resource and said more use could be made of special ship orders to place at-risk children with another family member.Rob Street, the director of justice at the Nuffield Foundation, said: “This important study provides much-needed national evidence on how supervision and special ship orders are being used.”Teresa Williams, the director of strategy for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), said the report was important. “It raises questions as to whether arrangements for children are sufficient to protect them from further harm,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5df3f4034719ecaacde1d0b13e611cd6b9fd4e/0_3_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b19ff365abebcb094f7d4faed65bcea","title":"belgian cycling nicole hanselmann","story":"A cycling race in Belgium was thrown into disarray when the leader of the women’s race, which set off 10 minutes after the men’s, almost caught up with her male counterparts and found herself in danger of being impeded by their support vehicles.The Swiss cyclist Nicole Hanselmann of the Bigla Pro team surged into an early lead of almost two minutes in the annual Omloop Het Nieuwsblad race around the Flemish Ardennes, but her solo breakaway was cut short by a hasty request that she stop at the side of the road as the event organisers neutralised the women’s race in order to restore the gap between the two groups.After being allowed to resume, Hanselmann was given a headstart on the peloton but was quickly reeled in and eventually finished in 74th place.“It was a bit sad for me because I was in a good mood and when the bunch sees you stopping, they just get a new motivation to catch you,” she told Cyclingnews. “We could just see the ambulances of the men’s race.

But Debbie Matthews, who has spent years learning to cope with her mental health issues, will bravely put herself in the heart of that crowd on Wednesday week, partly to promote her drive for racecourses to recognise the needs of people like her and partly to show support for Altior, the star horse who has provided a kind of therapy for her.It was a trip to Ascot in January to see Altior that brought Matthews some sudden fame within racing, thanks to a series of articles about her in the Racing Post over the following week. Little more than a month later Matthews is gratified by the response. “I’ve got a massive amount of public support,” she says, settling into the empty racecourse cafe at Newbury as the earliest arrivals for Saturday’s race-meeting trickle through the gates. “I think I’ve now got in excess of 1,000 messages, be that emails or through Twitter, from members of the public that are really behind what I’m trying to achieve.“This is not just people with social anxieties, it’s people who have children with ADHD or sensory disorders, who would like to come racing. But it’s not a suitable environment at the moment. Those people can be sensitive to things like noise, visual stimulation or even smells. Racecourses being quite big, busy, noisy places, they’re obviously not an ideal situation for that. I don’t have sensory issues but even for me it’s quite overwhelming.”Matthews’ intervention has focused minds on a subject that has seemingly gone unnoticed in horse racing. Her ideas were met with immediate interest, including from Jockey Club Racecourses, who have begun exploratory discussions with her as to what action might be possible at their 15 tracks, which include Cheltenham, Aintree and Epsom.“I think all racecourses have an access statement for people that have physical disabilities,” she says. “What I’m trying to push for – that racecourses have an invisible access statement – is a new thing. It probably isn’t something that people have been thinking about unless, like me, they’ve been affected by things like social anxieties or mental health issues.”Matthews is well placed to assist, not just because of her own experience but because her whole working life has been in tourism. She runs a consultancy business called Successful Stays and worked on Visit England’s guide to developing accessible destinations. She has now developed what she calls her Go Racing Green package, and hopes racecourses will find it attractive commercially – as a means of broadening the appeal of their venues, as well as something they should be pursuing out of simple fairness.“The plan is to go to the racecourse, give them an assessment of what they can do with the facilities they already have, to provide safe spaces, quiet spaces, provide Dementia Friends training, autism awareness training and follow-up support.” She can also assist with the sensitive business of how racecourses should then let that audience know this work has been done and that their track should now be a more welcoming place.“With physical accessibility, you are usually having to fork out money to put in ramps and lifts and toilet facilities, whereas with invisible accessibility it’s more about working with the facilities you already have.“I had a meeting at one track and they said, ‘Are you expecting a box?’ No, we’re not asking for VIP treatment. If you’ve got a room anywhere that you’re not using that day, or if you want to stick a gazebo up and stick some fold-up chairs and a couple of tables in there, that’s fine. We’re not saying, ‘Look at us, we’re special, we want the best views.’ We’re just asking for one little space where, if it all gets a little bit overwhelming, we can go and hide for 10 minutes. We’re certainly not asking for gold-ticket treatment, just a bit of consideration.”Matthews feels that, in an understandable wish to fill their bars and restaurants, racecourses may have forgotten that not all their customers are interested in food and drink. “I probably don’t move from the parade ring and the winner’s enclosure because I want to be as close to the horses as possible. That’s what engages me, that’s what makes me forget that I’m out and I might be anxious. I come here for the horses and that’s it.”Thanks to her raised profile, Matthews has been building a Go Racing Green community of people who recognise each other by wearing green ribbons or the green bobble hats sold through her blog these were paid for by the trainer Tom Lacey, with profits being ided between Samaritans and the Retraining of Racehorses charity. “My social anxiety hasn’t been cured but coming here is helping me because there’s other people out there saying: ‘I’m the same as you, I get you, you need to really push, because we would come racing as well.’ And that’s what’s spurring me on.”Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/972e9927d086e1514174333339a6b08e4c6d1d0a/16_272_4216_2531/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf54f4508175370aee4c10e265d86c6","title":"laura muir gold great britain european indoor championships","story":"• Dominant Scot adds 1500m gold to her win in the 3,000m• Shelayna Oskan-Clarke takes 800m with start-to-finish victoryLaura Muir stormed into history by becoming the first athlete to achieve the double-double at a European Indoor Championships – and thereby helping the British team to a record medal haul.The 25-year-old was a hot favourite to add the 1500m title to her 3,000m gold on Friday – repeating her success from Belgrade two years ago – and she duly obliged, leading from the gun before stretching a long way clear with 400m left and coming home in 4 min 05.91 sec. The Pole Sofia Ennaoui took silver, more than three seconds back, just pipping Ireland’s Ciara Mageean.A few minutes earlier there had been a major surprise in the men’s 1500m as the Norwegian wonder kid Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who was attempting the same double, was edged into second place by Marcin Lewandowski. But Muir, against a much weaker field, was never going to be thwarted.Her victory brought Britain’s medal tally at these European Championships to 11, beating the highest ever from Belgrade two years ago. That figure was quickly bumped up to 12 when Britain’s 4x400m women’s relay team of Laviai Nielsen, Zoey Clark, Amber Anning and Eilidh Doyle won silver on the last event of the night – although Poland topped the medal table by virtue of one more gold medal.“Nobody can take that away,” said Muir. “I’m the first person to do it and it’s really special. I might celebrate by going to the chippy”. However, she stressed that she would soon be knuckling down to prepare for the world championships in Doha. “I’ve got the indoor medals at the European and world stage, I’ve got the outdoor medals at the European stage – I’m missing that world stage medal and hopefully Olympic medal. Doha’s that first step and I want to be on that podium.”Muir said handling the pressures of a home championship – she trains at the Emirates Arena and recently bought her first house in Glasgow – boded well for the future. “I can’t really imagine there being a much more high-pressure environment than these past few days, and I’ve been cool as a cucumber really,” she said.Muir’s gold was not the only one for Britain on a night where medals seemed to arrive every few minutes. In the women’s 800m Shelayna Oskan-Clarke also led from gun to tape to win in 2 min 02.58 sec, ahead of Rénelle Lamote of France, with the Ukrainian Olha Lyakhova in third place.At 29 Oskan-Clarke is a late developer who was a personal trainer before bursting on to the scene in 2015. Since then she has won a world indoor bronze and a European indoor silver but this was her sweetest moment yet. “I know I’m strong but it’s just about making the right moves at the right times,” she said. “I wanted to be out there early and hold on for home. I knew I’d have no regrets then.”Meanwhile the unheralded south London science teacher Jamie Webb found the right formula for silver in the 800m behind the Spaniard Álvaro de Arriba, with the Irishman Mark English winning bronze. It provided one of the feelgood stories of the championships, but Webb will have little time to celebrate given that he is due back at school on Tuesday. “They best go easy on me because I’m tired,” he joked, before insisting that he could build on his result to go for Olympic glory. “I look at people like Nick Symmonds, who won a world championship bronze at 30, and there is no reason why I can’t run 1:44 or 1:43 this summer. I’ve improved every year and I was a latecomer to the sport.”The 24-year-old was clearly relishing the moment, declaring that his favourite element in the periodic table was krypton, “like Superman”, before adding: “I only started training at 18 properly, very progressively, and we’ve got a long-term view – it’s a big 18 months now, with world champs all the way through until Tokyo.”In the women’s pole vault Holly Bradshaw was also delighted with a silver medal after clearing 4.75m to finish behind the Russian Anzhelika Sidorova. “There were times when I questioned if I could ever get back to the level I thought I could be at,” admitted the 27-year-old. “But this indoor season has really concreted it to me that I can compete with the best.”Tim Duckworth took home silver in the men’s heptathlon, scoring 6,156 points to finish 62 behind the Spaniard Jorge Ureña.

And Johnson said that going forward with the contest at the Pepsi Center, home of the NBA’s Denver Nuggets, was against his ethos because of the “physical contact” involved in wrestling. “I guess the physical aggression, too,” he told the Denver Post. “I don’t want to treat a young lady like that on the mat or off the mat. And not to disrespect the heart or the effort that she’s put in. That’s not what I wanted to do either.”The national reactions to Johnston’s decision to forgo the final match of his high school career have varied. Some praised him for his politely articulated expression of respect for Rios.But others, myself included, believe he disrespected Rios by not giving her the chance to compete, leaving her with a hollow victory that cheapened her many hours of sacrifice.Maybe if we as a society can one day stop sexualizing girls’ bodies when they are competing in sport, episodes like these will be seen as relics of a bygone era. Young men will be able to compete against capable girls (like Rios, who defeated a number of boys to advance to her matchup with Johnson) without the disturbance of sexual undertones.Sadly, we’re not there yet.Instead we need to take the opportunity of cases like these to teach boys that if a girl is choosing to compete with them on equal footing, the discomfort of being physical in the context of sport should not make them uncomfortable. As the sports journalist Christine Brennan put it: young men will be competing and working with women the rest of their lives … so they’d better get used to it.But what if the issue is more complicated than that?Only 12 of the state associations that govern high school sports in the United States today have co-sanctioned their wrestling programs. This means boys and girls in essentially three-quarters of America are being put in the position of competing against each other, a situation that may not just be awkward for the boy, but also for the girl. While we can certainly explore the reasons why girls’ bodies are sexualized during competition, and why boys are being taught, by their parents or their coaches or society at large, that they cannot view girls as equals on the mat or field out of fear of disrespecting girls’ bodies, perhaps the question should be: how can we provide equal opportunity for girls to compete in their chosen sport?This is what Sally Roberts, founder of the non-profit Wrestle Like a Girl, wants to do. Roberts wrestled at an elite level, becoming a three-times US national champion and two-times world championships bronze medalist. She competed against boys in high school and went on to compete in the US Army’s World Class Athlete Program (WCAP), often finding herself on the mat with other men.“It was a co-ed space,” Roberts said of her experience. “So I would go in there and I would train with my peers, who treated me as an equal. That was how it was in the army, and of course we were all adults.”While Roberts was able to excel on the mat despite not having a girls’ program at her high school, she didn’t want other girls to negotiate the same barriers she did. Since founding Wrestle Like a Girl in 2016, Roberts has seen a dramatic uptick in interest around girls’ wrestling when young women are simply given the opportunity to compete.These days many of the conversations surrounding girls’ sports are centered on whether they should compete with and against the boys, when maybe the discussion should be centered around how to provide more equal opportunity for girls in sports.Take a look at Toni Harris, the first woman to receive a scholarship at a four-year university to play football in a skill position. This is but one of many signposts indicating that more girls are playing football than ever before, yet the opportunities for them to compete against other girls are still extremely limited.As Katie Sowers, who became third woman to coach in the NFL as an assistant with the San Francisco 49ers, said of Harris: “I remember when I used to dream of playing in the NBA before there was a WNBA. Let’s start the discussion of not when will there be a female NFL player, but when will women like Toni have an opportunity to make a living playing football in a league of their own.”Therein lies the crux of the problem of how girls’ sports are viewed in worthiness and respect to skill: in order for girls to be taken seriously as athletes, they must compete against boys, while simultaneously putting boys in a position that may make them uncomfortable. But as evidence shows, when girls are given their own space and opportunity to compete and train with other girls, their participation in sports increases, as well as reducing their likelihood of quitting.Until parity in opportunities for girls to play sports is achieved, though, we will continue hearing stories like the aborted match between Johnston and Rios, a contest with no real winner. Ultimately, we should not force girls to choose between competing against boys or not competing at all. Give them a space of their own to compete and the landscape of sports will become more equal and fair on its own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d59bc55fce16c5506de724bc25c8e64f7a6912/0_29_1529_2387/master/1529.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=82e23e4f1b9f19aefa4a3c7ce45b20a6","title":"can machines be more creative than humans","story":"A computer-generated artwork is going to auction at Sotheby’s – but will AI art have staying power?Mario Klingemann, a German artist who uses AI in his work, has radical views on creativity. “Humans are not original,” he says. “We only reinvent, make connections between things we have seen.” While humans can only build on what we have learned and what others have done before us, “machines can create from scratch”.It’s an interesting perspective. Setting aside whether or not human creativity is limited and indeed what precisely creativity is, it’s certainly true that artificial neural networks being developed today work out the rules as they go along, rather than being taught. AlphaGo, the AI that defeated the Korean go grandmaster Lee Sedol, was fed thousands of games, but no rules. It worked out how to play go entirely by itself.Klingemann is a pioneer of AI art. He loves the moments, he says, when the machine jumps the system and does something the human programmer didn’t expect it to do – such as when AlphaGo made a move no human player would ever have thought of making. Some of his work uses algorithms that create what appear to be human faces - but they are not the faces of anyone that has ever lived. They appear to have been dreamed up somewhere deep inside the machine’s “imagination.”It’s not the first time AI art has been auctioned. A piece by the French collective Obvious was sold at Christie’s in October for an eyebrow-raising $432,500, 40 times the estimated price. Many people in the AI world were outraged, including Klingemann. Obvious were outsiders in the field. They used a straightforward application of an algorithm that has been available since 2015 and their pieces involved a large amount of human intervention – deciding when a portrait was finished and framing it like an Old Master.Klingemann, conversely, is recognised as a leading player. He has shown pieces at the Museum of Modern Art, the politan Museum of Art in New York and Paris’s Centre Pompidou, among other places. These include his Neurography series, “cameraless photography” using a computer to create fictitious photographic images, sometimes in videos spouting fake news. In 2018 he won a Lumen prize for his piece The Butcher’s Son, a set of Francis Bacon-like images. It was the first time the prize had been won by an AI-generated artwork.Klingemann’s art is more challenging than Obvious’s. The piece on auction is an installation, Memories of Passersby I, made up of a wooden console housing a computer and two screens that display an endless stream of surreal male and female faces, with one morphing into the next. There is no human curation. The machine creates, and no two portraits are ever the same. Sit and watch the machine and it almost seems to be thinking.The algorithm Klingemann uses is a spin-off of a class of AIs called generative adversarial networks (GANs). One goal of AI research is to develop autonomous machines that can create on their own initiative. An essential element is that they are able to assess their own work.A GAN does just this. It consists of not one, but two neural networks – the “brains” of the program. One generates a flow of images out of nothing and the other, which has been trained on specific images, accepts or rejects them. In this way, the generator learns and creates better and better work from scratch.Klingemann uses a variant of this called Pix2Pix. He feeds in a certain amount of material, leaving the machine enough slack to move beyond its programming, as he puts it to “get creative”, unleashing it to do its own thing. He feeds in a blurry, nondescript image and the machine takes this unpromising material, picks out distinctive features, and shapes it into a human face, one that has not been programmed into it and has never existed before.But can machines really be creative? Can they be considered artists in their own right? If creativity is a defining characteristic of what it means to be human, how can a collection of wires and transistors be considered creative? Perhaps we’re not as different as we think. Ultimately, humans are mere biological machines, and conversely, a thinking, dreaming computer could be considered a silicon life-form. If we can be creative, why not computers? Computers may even become more creative than us, as Klingemann proposes. By trawling the web, they will have access, potentially, to all knowledge. Our human brains are too limited to imagine how powerful machine creativity may become.AI art raises a lot of questions. For a start, does it have more than novelty value? Ai-Da the Robot Artist was unveiled earlier this month to plenty of fanfare but little reference to the quality of the art it will produce. How are we to evaluate AI art? Should we apply the same criteria as for human art?At the moment all we can do is build machines that reproduce the way we think. We’re not capable of teaching them what we don’t ourselves know. But ultimately, we may build machines that can go beyond us, that are intelligent enough to create machines of their own, without human intervention. What is the use of all this research if its end is only to build machines that do no more than mirror our creativity? After all, Bach has already been done, by Bach.If, as Klingemann argues, machines can be truly creative while we are doomed only to build on what others have done, AI may ultimately liberate us. We can only expand on knowledge that has been passed down from previous generations. Machines may be able to dream up new realms of knowledge that we are simply incapable of producing, though we could appreciate it. “I hope machines will have a rather different sort of creativity and open up different doors,” Klingemann says.There are some who find the notion of creative machines deeply troubling, even offensive. In a recent article in the MIT Technology Review, the Harvard philosopher Sean Dorrance Kelly argued that creativity is one of the defining features of human beings and can only exist within a human context. This is surely short-sighted there is no reason to claim that creativity belongs to humans alone. As Klingemann’s work demonstrates, today’s machines already show glimpses of creativity in art. AlphaGo, too, has shown unexpectedly creative behaviour in playing Go. To assert that machines will be eternally incapable of creativity for the simple reason that they are not human is a blinkered way of looking at progress, especially in a field that goes beyond science and technology and touches on our everyday lives. Machines are redefining what it is to be living, not merely human, beings. And in fact, little by little, we are merging with them – beginning with our smartphones, which have become extensions of ourselves.Two monumental acts of creativity kickstarted the 20th century. Einstein’s relativity theory and Picasso’s development of cubism led us to see the world in new and profoundly different ways and have led to world-changing scientific and artistic developments. Both arose from people seeing connections between fields that seemed to have nothing to do with each other. Einstein saw a link between the laws of thermodynamics – of the way heat flows – and the nature of space and time, while Picasso turned to developments in mathematics, science and technology to widen his artistic palette.Perhaps in the future, with their encyclopedic knowledge and lightning-fast processing powers, computers will begin to accomplish similar leaps of the imagination, first matching, then surpassing human creativity. Such leaps could have incalculable value for humankind, opening up new cultural and scientific avenues for us to explore, creating new forms of art, literature and music, aiding medical research, and suggesting ways of dealing with our failing climate and growing ecological crisis. Far from replacing us, they might enhance us, enabling humans and machines to work side by side at the highest levels of creativity.• Arthur I Miller’s book, The Artist in the Machine: The World of AI-Powered Creativity, will be published by MIT Press in autumn 2019 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The trouncing deepened rifts within the party which, until the national elections, was led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, whose confrontational style also lost supporters.Renzi congratulated Zingaretti on Sunday, saying he won “a wonderful and clear-cut victory”. “Now this friendly fire must stop,” he added. “Our political opponents are not at home but in the government.”Zingaretti, whose brother Luca plays the title role in the TV series Inspector Montalbano, has led Lazio since 2013. He is regarded as a moderate leftwinger capable of uniting the party. The other two main candidates were Maurizio Martina, the party’s former caretaker leader, and Roberto Giachetti.The Democratic party has been accused of losing touch with voters, something that paved the way for Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the League, to thrive. The League leads in national polls, while support for M5S has slipped.Supporters of the Democratic party argue that it must now unite, particularly as it is fighting European elections in May, and convince people that it is a strong alternative. “The important thing today is that there is big participation,” said Mauro Valorani, a professor in Rome who backed Zingaretti. “We need to send a strong message that we don’t like what is going on in Italy and elsewhere in the EU. There is a far-right movement building across Europe that is much better organised than it used to be. Europe is a stronghold of democracy and we need to take care of this.”Giuseppe DeFinis, who also backed Zingaretti, said he voted “because the danger to Italy is Salvini”. He said: “He represents an obscure part of fascism, hatred towards ersity.”Franco Pina, who voted for Martina, said the situation was “dangerous and xenophobic”. He said: “The Democratic party leadership has made mistakes in the past, but now we must unite.”The three leadership candidates were among the estimated 200,000 people who converged in Milan on Saturday for a demonstration against racism.“It’s important to underline this demonstration,” said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome’s Sapienza University. “Not because of the Democratic party, but because it shows that society is pushing back against Salvini’s thoughts and hegemony.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2957e76243e52f336f2b8f12784442bc9b5bc98e/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c04a7aa754cdd4a3e05b6a8a5052cb92","title":"new ukip gerard batten corbyn hard right momentum","story":"In a year, Ukip has been transformed into an increasingly hard-right populist force. How did it happen?In a small flat on the edge of Glasgow, the future trajectory of Ukip is taking shape. From here, a fast-growing viral news site pumps out a daily stream of clickbait and conspiracy theory in support of the party’s hardline agenda.The site, Unity News Network, is run by Ukip’s Scottish youth leader, Carl Pearson, and the activist David Clews. It is one of three suddenly popular outlets pushing the party’s message to a receptive new audience: the young, angry and the digitally savvy.While Ukip’s lurch to the right has prompted an exodus of party stalwarts, it has more than made up for this with thousands of new members drawn in by the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, far-right YouTubers, and Ukip’s newfound dominance of the rightwing web thanks to the likes of Pearson and Clews.Along with Kipper Central and Politicalite, Unity News is heavily supportive of the hardline agenda of Gerard Batten, Ukip’s leader for the past year, who in that time has transformed the party into what analysts say is an openly far-right force.Insiders say Batten’s repeated anti-Islam rhetoric and the appointment of Robinson has prompted the departure of numerous senior officials and party organisers, threatening its ability to fight elections less than four years after Ukip gained almost 4m votes in the 2015 general election.Last month, Unity News racked up almost 2m views for its videos of France’s gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests. In one week in January, it amassed 55,892 interactions on Facebook, with Politicalite attracting 47,979 and Kipper Central 28,187, according to an analysis for the  by the metrics company NewsWhip.Surrounded by his 19-month-old son’s toys, Clews denies Unity is a Ukip propaganda site, but says many readers support the party. “What we do is not hyper-partisan – it’s populist,” he says. Having launched in April last year, the site attracts more than 120,000 users a month.Among the headlines decrying “the BIASED MEDIA” are stories attacking public figures such as Gary Lineker, Diane Abbott, Owen Jones and Anna Soubry, along with Brexit-themed memes such as one showing the US financier George Soros as a puppet-master controlling the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Such images of Soros, who is Jewish, are widely criticised as antisemitic in tone.Clews rejects the idea that his site seeks to stir up anger, or that its content could trigger real-world incidents. “If I was a taxi driver and someone got in and went and murdered someone after I dropped them off,” he says, “is the taxi driver responsible for that person being murdered?”Two hundred miles further south in Hartlepool, the other side of Ukip’s transformation is obvious. This was once the centre of its surge in the north-east. But these days the shutters are down on its former headquarters – still the office of the MEP Jonathan Arnott, who quit the party last year – and the distinctive purple front has been changed to white, with the only surviving relics some purple dustbins.Nigel Farage, the party’s former leader, once predicted Ukip would be the biggest party in the region by the end of this decade. But the 2015 election, in which the Ukip candidate fell 3,000 votes short of unseating Labour, was a high-water mark.Fast-forward four years and Ukip has vanished from Hartlepool, while the party itself, having seen its founding political goal realised in the result of the Brexit referendum, is becoming defined by anti-Islam policies, street protests and ties to the far right.Its demise in the town has been swift. Five of its six councillors quit the party a year ago, on the same day as Arnott. Others followed, among them Phillip Broughton, the party’s parliamentary candidate for Hartlepool in both 2015 and 2017, who has called the party “a complete and utter mess”.Across the entire Brexit-supporting north-east of England, Ukip has imploded. “It is sad really,” said the former Ukip council group leader John Tennant. The only route to a comeback, Tennant says, would be to row back on the hard-right agenda of Batten, who prompted Farage and others to flee the party late last year by appointing Robinson. “But I fear it’s too far down the line now,” he says. “It’s not my problem any more.”Only seven of 24 Ukip MEPs elected in 2014 are still with the party. In several other Ukip heartlands such as Boston in Lincolnshire and Thanet in Kent, MEPs were followed out of the door by local organisers.“These are the real campaigners, not the ones who just write crap on social media,” says one Ukip insider. “These are the ones who went door-knocking in the pouring rain, who ordered leaflets. And now they’re gone.”One source in Thanet, the scene of Farage’s 2015 bid for election that narrowly failed, says the party’s organisation is “something of a shadow of what it used to be”. “The office is hardly ever open, and the main people who kept things running have gone,” he says. “Ukip is finished here.”In interviews with those close to Batten, they say he has made it his personal mission to drag the party to the right, sidelining its ruling body on key decisions including making Robinson his adviser on grooming gangs and prisons last year.Robinson has more than a million Facebook followers, and has powerful friends around the world. Batten, 64, began courting those close to the English Defence League founder months before becoming Ukip leader in February last year, the  has learned. In October 2017, Batten held a private two-hour lunch with the then leader of the Football Lads Alliance, John Meighan, and the anti-Islam figurehead Richard Inman, both of whom have large online followings.Batten has also courted younger supporters through his embrace of three  YouTube agitators, who joined the party last year. One of these was Paul Joseph Watson, a senior editor at the US conspiracy theory website Infowars, which has argued that events such as 911 and the Sandy Hook primary school shooting were faked.Some of those who have stayed in Ukip support Batten’s change of stance and focus on Islam. Stuart Agnew, one of the party’s remaining MEPs, told the  he believed the influence of Islam on society meant the life chances of women in the UK were “going into reverse”. “Either females are born into radical Islamic families where their education is neglected and they are forced to wear burqas, making employment very difficult and reliance on benefits highly likely, followed by a forced marriage,” he says. “Or young white girls from dysfunctional families find themselves victims of Asian grooming gangs and a reluctance by the authorities to act.”But Agnew appears in a minority among long-standing Ukip members. One former senior figure says many people had initially clung on hoping Batten would change course or be ousted. “But now it’s so obvious that even people who’ve been trying to pretend nothing has changed can’t do so.”While the new model Ukip might gain attention and clicks, the departure of so many stalwarts will make fighting elections very difficult, with the local elections in May seen as a major test.“These days, if I had to organise a campaign I’d struggle to know who to phone. It used to be really straightforward,” one source says.Efforts at the ballot box will be all the more difficult now that Farage has launched his own pro-Brexit party. According to one source, Farage’s office receives regular emails from local Ukip activists asking how they can join, while some of the party’s seven remaining MEPs are also considering jumping ship.One of the many paradoxes of the party’s rapid transformation is how it has been instigated by a man initially appointed as an interim leader with a brief only to steady the ship, and whose opinions were long seen as fringe.“Gerard has been around Ukip forever, and he’s always had these odd views on Islam,” says one former party colleague. “A couple of times there was even talk about whether he should be reselected as an MEP, as his views were at the extreme of what could be tolerated. In the end it was decided it would be too disruptive to act.”One former senior party member draws a parallel with another political figure who was once on the fringes of his party. “He’s our version of Jeremy Corbyn – out on a limb for years until his moment comes. And when it does he’s brought in what you could call a hard-right Momentum to back him up. He’s completely changed the party.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646c7210c8f55566c97dba10ca69c24fcfdbbbc4/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7865e9f3626606350976151a4b6d58e8","title":"new ukip members shifting party far right","story":"Investigation reveals exodus of party’s moderates and influx of more extreme newcomersA surge in Ukip membership is shifting the party decisively towards the far right, as long-standing moderates are replaced by entrants attracted by an anti-Islam agenda based on street protest, a  investigation can reveal.Conversations with more than two dozen current and former Ukip figures, many of them senior, have uncovered an exodus of more moderate senior members and local organisers, hollowing out Ukip’s ability to fight future elections.Sources say many of the 8,000 or so newcomers who have joined in recent months appear to be younger and more radical, attracted both by Robinson and the party’s links to controversial YouTube agitators.Members of Ukip’s youth wing have posted antisemitic and other extremist messages online, and there has been a rise in the popularity of news websites pushing the party’s message.Analysts warn that with Ukip’s poll numbers rising amid the continued deadlock over Brexit there is a danger the party could soon be reinvented as a street movement, becoming the first significant far-right force in UK politics since the demise of the British National party (BNP).According to party insiders, Batten appointed Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, without consulting colleagues. They say he is increasingly adopting what one called a “bunker mentality” in which he relies heavily on Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League, and other confidants from the far right. has seen antisemitic messages posted on an unofficial Ukip youth web group, including one saying that life under Hitler was “better than anywhere else on earth”, and another describing Jews as “hook-nosed masters” who control the media. The member involved has since been expelled.And while Ukip has publicly sought to reject links to the yellow-vest protesters who have harassed politicians and journalists outside parliament and have links to far-right and anti-Islam views, their main Facebook page is run by Martin Costello, the chair of Ukip’s Wiltshire branch and a former parliamentary candidate. Costello told the  he was helping to coordinate the movement, describing himself as a “modern-day Wat Tyler”.Since Batten took over as Ukip leader last year, he has proposed new policies including extra checks for immigrants from Islamic countries and Muslim-only prisons, while his families spokesman has said Muslims gangs are responsible for “a holocaust of our children”.Such changes, together with the appointment of Robinson, prompted a series of MEPs to quit the party, among them the former leader Nigel Farage, who has since launched a new Brexit-based party. Of the 24 Ukip MEPs elected when the party topped the polls in the 2014 European elections, only seven remain.Insiders say this change has been reflected at local level, with many party organisers leaving. A source at one of Ukip’s former strongholds, Thanet in Kent, called the party operation there “a shadow of what it used to be”.But senior members say this has been balanced by an influx of predominantly younger members, many attracted by Ukip’s tie-up with YouTube personalities such as Paul Joseph Watson, from the far-right US conspiracy theory website Infowars.Batten is credited with turning around Ukip after the disastrous tenure of Henry Bolton. Katie Fanning, a member of Ukip’s national executive committee (NEC), calls his achievements “fantastic”.However, Fanning said Batten had appointed Robinson as an adviser without informing the NEC, describing this as “an unwise choice”.With so many opponents having left, Batten’s position looks secure, even though he faces a coming leadership contest, having taken over on an initial one-year interim basis.It remains to be seen how much he can use disquiet over Brexit as well as the reach of Robinson, Watson and others to build Ukip into a stronger political force, whether electorally or otherwise.Robert Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester, said some of Ukip’s recent rise in the polls could be down to voters not realising how much the party had changed.As an openly far-right organisation, Ford said, Ukip could be “too radioactive” to pick up disaffected Tory voters, who could instead be tempted by Farage. “If Ukip end up as BNP 2.0,” he said, “there’s a very low popularity ceiling on that.”However, Ford added, the party could thrive instead as a street-focused protest group: “The next couple of years are going to be very, very unpredictable in British politics. Brexit currently occupies all the space in media and politics, and no one quite knows what’s going to rush in when that space is finally vacated.”David Lawrence, a researcher with the group Hope Not Hate, said Ukip was “now explicitly a far-right party”.It was possible, he said, that in this form it could eclipse the influence of the BNP: “We are seeing a shift in the political landscape with Brexit, and I think it is significant that Ukip are now very extreme, and polling these kinds of numbers. It certainly speaks to very worrying trends in UK politics.”A spokesman for the party said Batten had “saved the party from certain financial collapse”.He said: “Ukip has employed new campaign staff for the upcoming local elections, and candidate recruitment and selection has been in overdrive since Mr Batten put the party on electoral red alert in December. Ukip does not stand for any ‘far-right’ policies, and our manifesto is available for all to read on Ukip.org.”The spokesman added: “ is a far-left propaganda organ that is only interested in publishing false information intended to damage Ukip’s electoral prospects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f70d62f8e002c95212579fb323930a5ae76ae7ed/0_429_6469_3883/master/6469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb44a18065df660dd7ff12ac2a0dd2c","title":"two sessions beijing locked down for chinas greatest political spectacle","story":"Activists rounded up and dissent stifled as Xi Jinping faces public scrutiny over trade, Xinjiang and Huawei at annual meetingChina’s largest political event of the year, a meeting of legislative delegates and political advisers known as the “two sessions”, gets under way this week and comes at a time when Chinese leader Xi Jinping faces one of the most challenging periods since coming to power.Thousands of delegates will descend on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing while authorities go into overdrive to prevent any semblance of dissent during the two weeks of meetings of the nearly 3,000-strong National People’s Congress (NPC) , and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body.Xi faces public scrutiny against the backdrop of a slowing Chinese economy, a bruising trade war with the US, heightened international concern over Chinese tech firm Huawei, and growing global criticism over Chinese policies in Xinjiang.The annual meeting is nicknamed the “two sessions” because both the NPC and the CPCC meet. The NPC, a legislative body, is often described as a “rubber stamping” parliament whose function is mainly ceremonial.During the meeting, NPC delegates will ratify legislation, personnel changes and the government budget – all of which have been largely approved beforehand. Delegates include not only government officials but also business executives and celebrities like Tencent founder Pony Ma, actor Jackie Chan, and former NBA player Yao Ming.Most laws are made by the NPC standing committee, which runs the legislature and passes laws throughout the year. The legislature, which has been meeting since 1954, has never voted down a proposed law. But there have been instances of dissent. In 1992, only two thirds of delegates voted in favor of China’s controversial Three Gorges Dam infrastructure project.Before major political events, security in Beijing is often tightened with human rights activists put under surveillance or “travelled” outside the capital. Hu Jia, an environmental activist based in Beijing, has been under house arrest since 26 February and was told by public security that he would be taken south to Guangdong during the meeting, and returned likely on the 16 March, after the two sessions concludes.“It happens every year. It’s not a strange thing. It’s called being placed under control, or being travelled, or placed under home arrest,” Hu said, before the annual meetings had begun.Hua Yong, an artist and dissident in Beijing, posted a poem on Twitter: “They will hold a meeting in Beijing … Public security enthusiastically sees me off … goodbye friends, goodbye Beijing.”Residents and commuters have noted the increased security measures throughout Beijing, with more police visible on the transport system. Commuters coming into Beijing by train said their bags were checked several times and women were forced to send any bottles of perfume back home. Since 3 March, citizens have been barred from sending anything into the sky, from lanterns to balloons.Citizens have been conscripted as volunteers for neighbourhood “stability control”. Elsewhere in China, officials also increased security measures. Notices posted in Xingyang in Henan province advised residents of the beginning of “war time” security mechanisms during the session.Debate among delegates, scholars, and political observers will be even more constrained this year. Notices ahead of the meeting instruct party members on the “right way to build the party” banning over-the-top praise of the party as well as criticism.“People can’t talk normally, and now even this kind of expression is forbidden. It shows this is a very sensitive period,” said Zhang Lifan, a historian based in Beijing who follows elite Chinese politics.“I’m afraid party committees have taken many preventive measures, to prevent any sensitive speech that can lead to a chaos during the meeting.”He believes discussion of economic issues and the trade war are inevitable. “I think there will still be some ways of talking about the political system, not in direct ways, but using the economy,” he said.Observers expect a new foreign investment law to be approved, aimed at addressing concerns from the US over intellectual property theft. According to draft versions, the law should ban local governments from forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to domestic firms.There are signs the NPC has gained importance under Xi. Before 2014, the NPC only very occasionally approved significant legislation, according to Changhao Wei, a law student at Harvard University who runs the NPC Observer blog. Most major laws would be made by the more powerful NPC standing committee, which approves laws year round. If the foreign investment law is ratified at this session, this year would be the fifth year the NPC has approved a major piece of legislation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217d17ecb737b39feeeb463db5c9febea7778ddf/0_2_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b576c581e63aae3759006854ad0fbc82","title":"macuxi indigenous people of the raposa reserve brazil in pictures","story":"The Raposa Serra do Sol reserve in northern Brazil is home to 25,000 indigenous people, whose land has been targeted by the country’s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3812720.1551625530!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"celtic tiger building defects widespread says housing expert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Priory Hall apartment complex in Dublin, which Dublin City Council had to refurbish due to fire safety issues.  File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Construction defects in Celtic Tiger era housing “are widespread”, a housing expert has warned, as fresh details emerge of structural flaws at four apartment complexes built during the boom years.Orla Hegarty, an assistant professor at the UCD school of architecture, said that in many cases residents are “living with leaks, damp, structural and fire safety defects without any means of remedying the problems”. She called for the introduction of an equivalent body to the Road Safety Authority for the building sector.Old building regulations, in place from 1991 until 2014, relied heavily on self-compliance by owners, designers and builders with limited independent oversight.The new regulations require certification from the design process right through to completion stage, with certified inspection at key stages by registered architects, registered building surveyors and chartered engineers.Homebond insurance policies provide cover for the repair of major structural defects within 10 years of construction, a timeframe which has expired for many of these apartment owners.A spokesman for the Department of Housing said new legislation had been introduced in the form of building control regulations in 2014 which require greater accountability and stricter standards of certification.Competence, good practice, complianceThe department is also working with the Local Government Management Agency to improve the effectiveness of the local authority building control system, and has progressed primary legislation to “promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance”. “However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer andor their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme”. The department has no statutory role in, or budget for, resolving defects in private homes, he said. The Government published a range of guidelines and recommendations for fire safety in apartment buildings in 2017, authored by a task force set up after the Grenfell tragedy in London.The department said that primary responsibility for compliance of works rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Once constructed and occupied, responsibility for safety generally passes to owners’ management companies in apartment blocks, the department said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Motorists stranded on Sunday evening as flights to and from Dublin Airport delayedSuspect detained at Manchester aiport, to be brought to NI for questioning over killingGalway businesses bracing for UK crashing out of EU without agreementApplying EU health checks on UK food imports \u0026lsquodifficult\u0026rsquo in a hard exit, say State vetsOpposition to \u0026euro2bn plan grows amid claims the cost of compensation has been underestimatedFire safety and other construction issues have dogged Irish apartmentsResidents concerned over balcony flaws and fire safety at north Dublin developmentSurvey revealed extensive roof problems and fire safety issues at Hyde SquareMany apartment residents \u0026lsquoliving with leaks, damp, structural and fire safety defects\u0026rsquoApartments close to IFSC, Google and Facebook originally built by Treasury HoldingsResidents in four Celtic Tiger-era developments face steep bills, eviction and costly litigationFire safety issues and structural defects are common in many boomtime apartmentsTenants in Dublin 13 block call for State funding to fix Celtic-Tiger era building defectsIrish Rail also seeking to buy 41 inter-city carriages as passenger numbers soarMinister for Children to launch course provided by An Cos\u0026aacuten centre in west DublinRestrictions on use of aid money to be set aside following abortion reform in IrelandHotline for public to give anonymous tip-offs set up by Garda Anti-Corruption UnitAutism charity issues warning following ASTI and TUI instructions to membersMinister keen that working group reviews the obstacles to people using birth controlMeeting an opportunity to \u0026lsquofocus on broader issues\u0026rsquo in lead-up to Commons votes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3812863.1551643307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south dublin homes affected by busconnects could get 500 000 each resident claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarrister and local election candidate for Fine Gael James Geoghegan outside Elm Park golf club in Donnybrook. Photograph: Laura HuttonThe €2 billion BusConnects plan is facing a raft of objections across Dublin with opposition spreading against newly-announced routes.Residents who face the loss of gardens under compulsory purchase orders say their complaints are not motivated by “nimby-ism” but a desire for proper planning. The project they say “will cost enormous amounts of money and make things worse” for cyclists, pedestrians and businesses as well as homeowners.Some residents, including a number of homeowners on the planned route between Rathfarnham and the city centre, also claim the National Transport Authority has seriously underestimated the cost of compensation.The NTA’s deputy chief executive Hugh Cregan has said the organisation will compensate owners for the devaluation of their properties, and Keith Lowe chief executive of estate agent DNG said this loss in valuation could be up 25 per cent of the value of a property.Some 100 properties along Terenure Road East and Rathgar Road which have received notices that they may lose part of their gardens, are heritage properties, some valued in the region of €2 million.“On that basis people on Rathgar Road could argue for devaluation payments of up to €500,000 each,” said resident Paula Moore.She said there were a further 155 houses along the Rathfarnham route – route 12 under the plan – which would also require varying levels of compensation. The figures could dwarf the NTA’s total estimate of €40-€48 million including construction costs for route 12, she said.“But it is not about the money. If it were, people may be tempted to take it and retire to the sun. The design of the project is flawed,” she said.An engineer “who spent five years with the EU on road design”, she said the published justification for creating corridor 12 was based on a seven- or eight-minute saving at peak times. “And this seveneight minutes includes the time-saving to be made by introducing cashless fares which could be done now, and amount for probably half this time-saving. This is straight out of the feasibility study,” she said.Cyclist Stephen Bailey said there were 10 bus stops on Rathgar Road “and every time a bus stops it will pull in across the cycle lane. The cycle lane is higher than the road so the level will drop and rise again every time we pass a gate or a bus stop. It is clear someone will fall”.Rathgar resident Kanti Sabherwal said he had been told he may lose more then 4m of his front garden which would make it very difficult to park in his driveway.Michael O’Brien of the O’Brien Press said the shortened driveways would mean residents and business owners reversing out into “a six-lane highway”, while parts of the pavement would be reduced from 2.8m in width to 2m. “Nobody will be able to stop outside a shop,” he said.Dr Peter O’Sullivan said the cut-off in front of his property could make a wheelchair ramp inaccessible while the land take around Christ Church in the centre of Rathgar would severely damage the character of the village. “The plan will cost enormous amounts of money and make this worse,” he said.DonnybrookSimilar concerns have been raised on Nutley Lane in Dublin 4, where bus corridor 14 will take land from RTÉ, Elm Park Golf and Sports Club and St Vincent’s hospital. The club is set to lose part of its tennis courts. According to a draft response to the NTA seen by The , the club is claiming it cannot reconfigure its facilities.St Vincent’s hospital said it received a notice and was expecting a meeting with the NTA on the issue, while RTÉ, which is already reconfiguring its facilities on site said it would not comment.Barrister James Geoghegan, a Fine Gael local election candidate, said BusConnects was emerging as a significant issue on the doorsteps as householders learned what was being planned. Residents have raised concerns about the impact of the corridor on access to their homes and the felling of close to 100 trees under the plan.Routes 12 and 14 are among six routes, details of which were announced last week by the NTA. Some 390 households will lose part of their gardens across the six routes.The project is aimed at reducing congestion while also creating “better and safer cycling facilities”, according to the NTA. It points out that bus services are the main form of public transport across Dublin with 67 per cent of public transport journeys each day made by bus.A public consultation on the latest routes will run until April 30th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3813003.1551641919!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet to meet informally at farmleigh to discuss brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe informal meeting of the Cabinet at Farmleigh House will be “a good opportunity to take stock and focus on broader issues”, a Government spokesman said. Photograph: Eric LukeMinisters will meet at Farmleigh House on Monday evening for an informal Cabinet meeting over dinner where they will discuss Brexit as the process enters a crucial 10-day period culminating in next week’s votes in the House of Commons.The Government spokesman said it was “a good opportunity to take stock and focus on broader issues” but declined to be drawn on whether Ministers would discuss the clarifications and assurances sought by London on the Border backstop.UK and European Union negotiators are seeking to reach agreement on the text of the assurances, which may be contained in a standalone document to sit alongside the withdrawal treaty.The Government and the EU remain determined that the backstop guarantee that there will be no hard border in Ireland in the future will not be watered down, but are open to providing assurances that the backstop is intended to be temporary and that the UK will not be “trapped” in a customs union indefinitely.However, there is no agreement yet on a mechanism or a text that reconciles the requirements of the two sides, though intensive discussions are likely to resume this week in Brussels.The House of Commons is due to hold a series of votes next week, on the existing withdrawal treaty (with or without the new assurances on the backstop sought by the British), on ruling out a no-deal Brexit and on a possible extension of article 50, now widely expected in both London and Brussels.If British prime minister Theresa May is to have any chance of securing parliamentary assent for the withdrawal treaty in the vote next week, agreement on the backstop assurances is required in the coming days.Brexit fundMeanwhile, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has announced that an emergency loan fund for businesses suffering cashflow problems because of Brexit has been increased from €20 million to €200 million.“It’s for companies that get into serious difficulties and they need rescue and restructuring,” she told the Sunday Business Post. “Generally it would be liquidity problems.”Her department will also urge businesses on Monday to make sure they are ready to avail of the customs Transit procedure for moving goods through the UK landbridge post-Brexit.The Transit procedure allows goods to pass across customs borders with all duties and other charges suspended until arrival at their destination.“In order to avail of the Transit procedure, businesses will need to have a Revenue-approved comprehensive financial guarantee in place. This comprehensive guarantee is required as financial security to cover all potential and actual customs debts such as customs and taxes,” the department said.It is a move senior Labour backbencher Caroline Flint warned could lead to the rebellion of up to 60 MPs.Mr McDonnell said it would be common practice to see MPs whipped to support party policy, but said he understood the difficulties such a decision could pose for MPs in pro-Leave constituencies.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Thomas Turner via ReutersA giant sunfish has washed up on a beach in California, the first time this particular species of the animal has been sighted in the northern hemisphere in 130 years.The sunfish measuring 2.05 metres (6ft 8 in) and weighing several hundred kilograms, or more than 600lb, was found on the beach of the Coal Oil Point Reserve in California.Staff at the reserve posted photographs of the enormous fish on social media, incorrectly but understandably identifying it as an ocean sunfish (Mola mola), which is commonly found in seas off the US.Instead, it was something more remarkable, a hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta), a rare species that was first spotted in 2014 by a Danish PhD student working in New Zealand, and formally identified in 2017.“We don’t really know much about it,” said Marianne Nyegaard, associate researcher at Auckland War Memorial Museum, who discovered and named the new species, and was able to inform the California team that they had a hoodwinker on their hands.With the exception of one documented sighting off the Netherlands in 1889, the hoodwinker has only ever been spotted in southern hemisphere waters, off New Zealand, Australia, Chile and Peru.“That’s as far north as I have seen it, that corresponds to a cold water current,” she said. “For this fish to suddenly rock up in California is really exciting.”It can be difficult to identify the different species of sunfish – which is why it took so long for the hoodwinker to be classified as a separate species – and Ms Nyegaard has trawled through dozens of reports of hoodwinker sightings on social media. As a result, when she was sent the Facebook post from the Coal Oil Point Reserve, she had her doubts.“I was really sceptical,” she said.But after asking staff from the reserve to go out and take more pictures of the features that distinguish a hoodwinker sunfish from an ocean sunfish – a flap iding the rounded clavus that the fish has in place of a tail, bony structures along the clavus and the scale structure – it was clear it was a hoodwinker.“When the pictures came through, they were so so clear, I just could not believe it, it was a mix of disbelief and excitement,” she said.As to why this particular fish made its way so far north – potentially more than 4,000 miles (6,800km) from home – that is unclear.“It could just be a lost sunfish, or it could be we don’t understand the distribution yet,” she said. “Then of course there is the whole issue around climate change, we can’t conclude anything from just one specimen, but of course it is the question.”Researchers from the University of Santa Barbara collected samples from the dead fish, including one bound for Ms Nyegaard’s research. The genetic sample will enable her to check if the Californian hoodwinker is from the same population as those off New Zealand.The genetic analysis will be done by Ms Nyegaard’s sister Dr Mette Nyegaard, a geneticist at Aarhus University in Denmark.–"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

famous baddies, the daleks, with Jon PertweeThe BBC has included the Doctor Who theme tune alongside works by Vivaldi and Brahms on a list of “trailblazers” designed to teach children about the world of classical music.Delia Derbyshire’s electronic arrangement of the Doctor Who theme will join a new piece by Hans Zimmer, the film and television composer, in a Ten Pieces selection which “reflects the breadth and range of compositional styles”.The Ten Pieces project, which has been running since 2014, will this year feature “trailblazers” in a new attempt to lure young people towards a love of classical music.  Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general, said the selection represented works “all written by people who broke the mould”.Vivaldi’s Winter from The Four Seasons will be join by Brahms’ Hungarian Dance No.5 and Symphony No. 1 in E Minor by Florence Price, first African-American woman to be recognized as a symphonic composer.Jodie Whittaker as Doctor WhoRhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin and Symphony, Finale by Ravi Shankar will also feature, with  Overture by Grażyna Bacewicz, who secretly composed and gave concerts in occupied Warsaw during the Second World War.Delia Derbyshire’s famous electronic version of the Doctor Who Theme, originally composed by Ron Grainer, will also be recognised with a new arrangement by current Doctor Who Composer-in-Residence, Segun Akinola.“Derbyshire’s pioneering work as part of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and use of revolutionary techniques to create new world sounds helped cement her cult status as a pioneering composer of contemporary electronic music,” the BBC said.Hans Zimmer composed for Planet Earth IIHans Zimmer, the Oscar-winning composer known for his work on films including Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Interstellar, Gladiator, Inception, Dunkirk and The Dark Knight trilogy, will write a new piece entitled Earth, featuring a selection of young voices set to the backdrop of our magnificent, precious planet”.Zimmer, who has recently composed for Sir David Attenborough’s BBC nature documentaries, said: I am honoured to have been asked to create a piece for BBC Ten Pieces Trailblazers series.At the heart of my new piece, Earth is the sound of young voices who underlie the music.Set against the backdrop of our magnificent, precious planet, I hope it will be the perfect springboard to inspire creativity in classrooms across the UK.Lord Hall said the ambition to ensure every school child experienced the genre was one we should all support.He said: I am grateful to the schools, teachers and community leaders on the ground who have made Ten Pieces what it is today.I\u0027d like to thank them for their support and I can\u0027t wait to see what they make of our next 10 pieces, all written

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateSeveral studies have highlighted that young people are no longer as motivated by money as they used to be, and are increasingly prioritising a sense of purpose over pay. Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work.

Overnight, it robbed him of his confidence and his work as a commercial tyre fitter. He became housebound, unable even to make a cup of tea, and so depressed that one evening he found himself on a bridge near his home in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales, contemplating suicide.\u0026nbspThat was four years ago. Now Mr Ricketts is helping other people suffering from disabilities and loneliness with the Llanelli Visually Impaired Bowls Club. The bowls club has flourished since Mr Ricketts founded it in 2016. This year, they are raising money to attend a national championship in Weston-Super-Mare.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts is also working with the local Men’s Sheds\u0026nbspcharity and\u0026nbspStreet Buddies, a volunteer scheme for residents to get involved in the community. For some of this work, he is paid in time credits, a form of community currency that can be exchanged for tickets to concerts and access to parks and leisure centres.“It’s given me a real boost,” he says. “It’s a way to pay people for help without using money and it makes me feel really good, because I’m giving something back.”What is Venezuela’s new currency system?The stock exchange for goods and skills in GlasgowTime credits in the UK are issued by Tempo (formerly known as Spice). The charity was founded in 2008 at the the Wales Institute for Community Currencies. In their original form, time credits were an experiment to help rebuild\u0026nbspthe ex-mining communities of south Wales.Time credits offer an alternative way to reward work that is traditionally unpaid at a time when local authorities are relying on communities to step in and provide care for the lonely and vulnerable. They should never replace paid work, but time credits\u0026nbspmight give meaning or value to an exchange with a person with disabilities, mental health or addiction issues who could struggle to take part in the monetary economy.\u0026nbspIn times of crisis, such as in Argentina at the turn of the millennium or during the Greek financial crisis, barter economies and community currencies can facilitate exchanges between people when the monetary economy fails. \u0026nbspSome 50,000 people have since earned 700,000 time credits since 2008. Mr Ricketts says the scheme has huge potential in areas of low income by helping community groups give back to volunteers. Families awarded time credits can use the scheme to take advantage of daytrips and leisure activities that might otherwise be beyond their reach.\u0026nbsp“I have seen the potential of them for families with low incomes,” he says. He has been known to give some of his own time credits to people when he sees them counting the pennies to buy a cup of tea.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts always keeps some time credits in his pockets. Given his condition, that can cause confusion. “They look and feel like the new plastic fivers,” he says. “Because I can’t see I have been known to try and pay for a pint with time credits in the pub.”Similar schemes around the UK encourage people to swap their time or labour for time in kind. In Hull, the HullCoin rewards people for getting involved in community action with a digital currency that can be used to get discounts with local businesses. Many cities also have a time-banking network co-ordinated by Timebanking UK. Time-banking is rooted in the idea that every person has something to contribute to their community, regardless of their circumstances.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

He says time credits are a way to enable people like Stephen Ricketts to take a role in their community by recognising the efforts that go into volunteering. The scheme also gets new people into volunteering. Half of people earning time credits have have volunteered before.“People volunteer for its own sake and that’s fine,” Mr Merrill says. “But we know that time credits bring people into volunteering who wouldn’t already do it.”\u0026nbspMr Ricketts says he uses time credits at bowls to thank personal assistants for extra jobs, like making a round of tea, putting out biscuits for the players, or cleaning up afterwards. “After a bit of time, I found out the assistants had children and they were taking them swimming, so when they wanted to take their family out to a leisure part or a theatre, I gave them the time credits to cover it,” he says.Volunteers can currently spend their time credits golfing at Pembrey Park in Wales, learning to paddleboard in Essex, or on hair and beauty treatments at participating salons. They can also be exchanged for short courses at some college and classes to learn how to act or how to cook healthier meals.What really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Simon, whose last name is withheld, earned his first time credits with the Haringey Project, which helps people with mental health problems or substance misuse. He earned credits volunteering with gardening when he lived in St Mungo’s Hostel for two years. With the credits he earned, he took his mother on outings to Tower Bridge, Keat’s House and Kensington Palace.\u0026nbsp“I’ve taken my mum to places she’s never been to before,” he says. “I went on lots of trips with time credits this August, it was the best August of my whole life.”Tempo is now looking at harnessing technology to bring time credits to more people. Mr Merrill says time credits could become ever more important in the UK during tightened economic circumstances. “Time credits enables people to address needs in their own communities,” he says. “If they can help unlock capacity and create connections that weren’t there before, those are good things.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He told me he had once picked up a distressed woman from a nightclub, late at night, and she told him she had just been sexually assaulted by a north African immigrant.After taking a few moments to digest this, I asked the obvious question: “But what’s that got to do with Brexit?” He had barely begun answering before he accidentally drove through a red light, triggering a camera flash. This was going to cost him.\u0026nbspFor an Australian, getting to understand Brexit has been a process of getting to understand the English. I had a slight advantage on some of my compatriots. I was born in England, though my family moved to seek sun, sand and work after the winter of discontent in 1978-79 when I was a child.\u0026nbspI retain enough Englishness (and English relatives) to appreciate the lingering distrust of the continent and its people, the instinctive rejection of the post-war plan for all Europe to join in an ode to joy and brotherhood.

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fans of trade deals. As a self-aware “middle power”, we know that we prosper through alliances. We have few empire romances to fall back on (though we have the Commonwealth\u0026nbspmore of that later). We instinctively seek to draw ourselves closer to our neighbours, friends and trading partners through deals and forums.\u0026nbspFarage (AFPGetty)The sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surprise.From the start there was an immediate interest from our readers – reflected in the below-the-article arguments and in article click-throughs. I soon found myself writing seemingly endless updates, analysis pieces and weekend news reads on this technical, political spasm on the other side of the world.In the pre-Trump era Brexit was the international focus for a global trend: the rise of nationalism, the disillusionment with globalism, the fear of “uncontrolled”\u0026nbspmigration.\u0026nbspThese factors have been playing out in Australia too, though with different timing and emphasis.\u0026nbspWe managed to make it through the financial crisis more or less unscathed, so the economic triggers for Brexit were alien to us, or at least less relatable.As tensions rise with China, Brexit seems more dangerous than ever Australian salaries are high and public services pretty robust. But our housing availabilityaffordability bubble is as bad as Britain’s, with similar knock-on effects for quality of life.\u0026nbspOur migration “crisis”\u0026nbspcame in 2001, with a surge in the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Our then centrist, populist prime minister John Howard seized the moment to proclaim: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”It was a resonant phrase. Like the best political slogans it was impossible to argue with, defending controversial politics with impenetrable rhetoric.\u0026nbspWhen Australians heard the Brexiteer slogan “take back control”\u0026nbspwe immediately recognised what was going on.Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fastDavid Cameron could have taken a leaf from Howard’s playbook. When Howard was confronted with an irresistible push for a referendum in the late Nineties (on Australia becoming a republic, which Howard strongly opposed), he responded with a process ingeniously designed to undermine it: first, a national convention to agree on a model that was inevitably going to be a compromise nobody liked, then a vote in which half the people who wanted a republic would vote against it because it wasn’t the republic they had imagined. Sadly, Howard didn’t offer this advice or Cameron didn’t seek it.So the campaign began. As a foreign correspondent I rarely had to report the daily tennis match. This avoided much of the problem faced by domestic media: the failure of “he said, she said”\u0026nbspjournalism when confronted with daily exaggerations and concoctions from campaigners, and the rejection of expertise.\u0026nbspInstead, my editors wanted to know what was driving public opinion. Not quite a forecast of the result, but understanding of, whichever way it fell, why it had fallen that way.My initial theory was that it would shake out much like the 2014 Scottish referendum. It was to be nationalistic passion and vague promises of future benefits, up against a well-organised steamrolling campaign of warnings about the inevitable costs and risks.Farage says he would rather \u0027go on holiday\u0027 than vote in a second Brexit referendumThe sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surpriseBut then I met an insightful\u0026nbspBrussels thinktank chief, whose depressing logic completely changed my mind.\u0026nbspFabian Zuleeg told me the above theory was “plausible… but not one I believe in”. He asked the simple question: “Who’s going to campaign against Brexit?”Business would be reticent, worried about spooking shareholders. Much of the media were scathingly Eurosceptic. Trade unions were never really on board with the EU. Labour was ided. Cameron was on the nose with voters and had for years (like many of his colleagues) used the EU and immigration as a political punch bag. On the other side were figures like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: stump speakers with mass appeal. I’d met Farage. I understood why he was political catnip.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite frightening,” the thinktank chief said. “If you look at the general attitudes towards migration (in the UK) it’s intensely negative and I think this is going to drive a lot of this agenda.”For an Australian to lecture the UK on political self-harm is, of course, the height of hypocrisy. We’ve changed prime ministers six times in the past 11 years, only twice as the result of an election, and we’re quite likely to do it again in 2019. And if any country is going to sympathise with a nation torn by an endless debate over migration, it’s Australia.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the referendum, though, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull channelled the mood of much of our country: bemused tolerance.\u0026nbsp“If the British people, in their wisdom, decide to stay in the European Union then we would welcome that,” he said a month or so ahead of the vote.\u0026nbspTheresa May to meet opposition leaders as Labour snubs offer of talks More than 170 business leaders urge May to back second referendumCorbyn will do no better than May when it comes to BrexitThere was self-interest too, Turnbull said. Australian businesses like to base in the UK and take advantage of access to the EU.\u0026nbspAnd Australia as a member of the Five Eyes group, sharing intelligence with the UK, felt from a security point of view it was “an unalloyed plus for Britain to remain in the EU”.Then came the vote.\u0026nbsp“We respect the wishes of the British people,” Turnbull said afterwards. Rather optimistically, he added: “I have no doubt that in due course, the British government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union.”Privately, he held a different view. After being deposed, at a private speech in November 2018, Turnbull said what he really thought.\u0026nbspBrexit was a “catastrophe”, he said – a decision “not even understood by the government, let alone by the people. It was absolutely uninformed consent.”Nevertheless, a significant faction of conservative Australian politics\u0026nbsp(including the then high commissioner in London) threw itself\u0026nbspenthusiastically behind Brexit.\u0026nbspSince the vote, then, our official attitude has essentially been:\u0026nbsp“Ok, what’s in it for us?”\u0026nbspMost obviously, there’s a trade deal. Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fast.\u0026nbspWe’re a relatively minor trading partner for the UK (compared with, say, the US), so there’s less at stake and the UK can use us as a kind of training ground before it takes on the ruthless brainboxes from Washington DC. And there’s the Commonwealth link. Brexiteers imagined Commonwealth ties as a\u0026nbspbasis for post-Brexit UK’s international identity.\u0026nbspAustralia is happy to play along with this, especially as Brexiteers seem to think the Commonwealth consists entirely of Australia, New Zealand and Canada.And, finally, it feels like a historical revenge served cold. When the UK joined the EU it triggered a dramatic change in UK-AU trade.\u0026nbspWe lost a market, and it forced us to refocus on our region. In a way it was a favour: Australia prospered hugely from its growing ties to the developing economies to our north.\u0026nbsp But some (especially the older, more Anglophile corner of conservative politics) have never forgotten this slight. When Britain comes begging for post-Brexit favours, it will be a sweet moment indeed.Nick Miller has been the Europe correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in London, since 2013We’ll tell you what’s true.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth. Those scores can be viewed historically through the app, which also keeps data on things such as how often your gums bleed.The Genius X is due to be released later this year and pricing has not yet been announced.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This supports the merger model of black hole growth,” he said.The group’s results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Ms Wong made the discovery after coming across\u0026nbspthe words “Hide Tweet” in the app’s code, which Twitter later confirmed to be the new feature.“Thanks to Jane and @MattNavarra for starting the conversation about this feature we are developing. We wanted to provide a little more context on it,” Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter.“We often hear from heavy Tweeters that they want to be able to protect their conversations. People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start as healthy as possible by giving them some control.”Twitter is secretly keeping hold of deleted DMsTwitter is ‘thinking about’ a new edit featureMs Haq\u0026nbspexplained how Twitter categorises\u0026nbspconversations as an ecosystem containing\u0026nbspfour different groups: Authors, repliers, the audience and the platform. “We try to balance the experience across all four groups, and we are continuously exploring ways to shift the balance without overcorrecting.”She added: “We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original Tweeter and the audience.”Twitter said it planned\u0026nbspto start testing the new Hide Tweet feature publicly “in the coming months”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By rushing these changes to legislation, they are leaving British workers at a severe disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues.”The\u0026nbspSIs have now been approved in the Commons, despite concerns raised by MPs\u0026nbspthat the loss of European Works Councils would prevent British workers from large multinational companies having a voice in line with European colleagues.Shadow minister Justin Madders told MPs in the debate that the change\u0026nbsp“clearly constitutes a loss of valuable workers’ rights in contravention of the PM’s promise to maintain existing workers’ rights at current levels”.Business minister Kelly Tolhurst was also warned that the changes risked\u0026nbsp“watering down” Tupe protections, which protect workers when a business is taken over by a new employer.Mr Madders said\u0026nbspministers could not “nod through” changes when\u0026nbspthousands of employees could be affected, as it will apply to public sector services, PFI and outsourcing contracts.But Ms Tolhurst argued the SIs were only “minor changes to language” and would protect workers from uncertainty if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.The Trades Union Congress\u0026nbspsaid the move would would make it easier for UK workers to fall behind their European counterparts.A spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister has promised that workers’ rights will be protected and enhanced after Brexit. But these regulations show that, despite her warm words, her government’s actions are taking us in a different direction.“The regulations would erode valuable rights relating to European Works Councils. And they would remove powers that allow ministers to keep UK law in line with EU law. This would make it easier for UK workers’ rights to fall behind those in the rest of Europe.“The prime minister is eager to cast herself as a champion of workers’ rights. But the reality is that her Brexit deal puts rights at risk.”Leave supporters to pay £50 to join Nigel Farage on Brexit marchThe new government legislation\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspas the prime minister was expected to make a last-ditch attempt to win over Labour politicians in Leave-voting areas with a package of measures on workers rights ahead of the meaningful vote on 12 March.Electronic balloting for trade union members is another issue reportedly being considered by Downing Street, allowing union leaders to organise strike action more efficiently.Ms May also confirmed at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday\u0026nbspthat there would be a fund to “ensure our towns can grow and prosper” after widespread speculation she was planning to offer cash to MPs in former industrial heartlands.A government spokesperson said: “This legislation provides certainty and legal clarity to employers and workers in the event of a no-deal scenario. As we leave the EU, we will protect workers’\u0026nbsprights and continue to enhance them.“The prime minister has made clear that parliament will get a vote on whether it wishes to follow suit whenever EU standards in areas such as workers’ rights are judged to have been strengthened.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

friday","story":"But when exactly is the holiday in  Unlike Halloween, Christmas and Valentine’s Day which all fall on fixed dates, Easter can fall anytime between March  and April .In  it falls on Sunday, April .Good Friday is therefore April , and the Easter Monday bank holiday is on April .The date is decided by a complex set of calculations based on observations of the moon.In early Christianity, dferent churches used dferent methods, leading to disagreements which remain unresolved centuries later.Eastern and Western churches continue to celebrate Easter according to dferent calendars, although sometimes by chance the festivals coincide.Schools usually get around two weeks off for the Easter break.Because Easter is late this year, in most areas kids will be off for the two weeks before.That means they break up on Friday, April , and go back on Easter Tuesday, April  - which is also St Georges Day in England.With the weekends and the bank holiday, that stretches to  days.Other schools might take the two weeks either side of Easter so the two bank holidays fall within the Easter holidays.Dates y in dferent areas so you should check your school or councils website.In Western Christianity, Easter Sunday must always follow the first full moon after the spring equinox.Easter celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus, which the Bible says happened around the Jewish festival Passover.Passover typically begins on the night of the first full moon after the spring equinox, except in leap months when it is the second full moon, as in .Because the precise timing of observing the full moon can y in each time zone, the Church instead calculates the date from ecclesiastical calendar.This ides  normal calendar years into  months of  and  days each, with the ecclesiastical full moon on the th day of each lunar month.The paschal full moon - from the Aramaic for Passover - is the one that falls on or after the spring equinox on March .Easter Day is the first Sunday after the paschal full moon - sothe full moon is on a Sunday, Easter will be a week later.Therefore the earliest Easter can be is March , and the latest is April .The latest Easter in recent years was April  in the year , and the earliest was March  in .It will not fall in March again until  when it is on March .In  a full moon fell on March , just before the equinox, so the paschal full moon was the next one on April .This was a Sunday so Easter was seven days later on April .It will not be this late again until .Christians in the East use the Julian calendar,  days behind the Gregorian calendar used in the West, so the full moon and equinox are calculated according to a dferent date.This means in  the Eastern church will celebrate Easter on April , a week after Western churches.Some years, such as in , ,  and , the two churches celebrated Easter on the same day. It will happen next in .In other years the festivals may be up to five weeks apart, as happened in  and . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will claim their rebellion against Theresa May — a cynical, calculated risk that she is too weak to sack them — was designed to make Brexiteers realise ­voting down her deal could kill Brexit.It may have done that. But it wasn’t lost on Brussels either. And it has severely weakened our hopes of getting the one thing Brexiteers and the DUP need.Cabinet Remainers are guilty both of rank disloyalty and short-sighted stupidity.FOR a shining example of Remoaner madness, witness the negativity to Norway’s huge investment in post-Brexit Britain.Its £billion wealth fund is increasing its UK holdings because, like Qatar, it is sure we will thrive outside the EU.To ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie, though, Norway is just hoovering up our assets on the cheap due to Brexit. Yet he would have been first to blame Brexit had Norway SOLD its UK investments.Some politicians have simply abandoned reason. Their Remainia is religious.THE BBC should be allowed nowhere near its new “BritBox” service.The supposed BBC ITV rival to ­Netflix will require a reported £-a-month subscription.

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He started a job at a software firm but was made redundant.Sovu led a gang of Romanians who built the skimmers and  ATM fronts from a shed in a back garden in Harwich Road, Colchester, Essex.The crooks used toy remote control cars to fool airport security when transporting the skimmers. By placing them inside the cars, they appeared as innocent wiring for the toys.The gang were finally stopped in  after British Transport Police officers identied suspects interfering with rail ticket machines.At Sovu’s trial prosecutors said the case involved ‘millions of pounds of fraud’ because the device ‘gives them access to your money and the banks money’.IT expert Nick Webber, who worked on the police investigation into Sovu, said: “He created thousands of these devices.“Each could hold , card details and the average bank account holds £, so he must have cost banks hundreds of millions and very likely billions of pounds.“He’s effectively the biggest bank robber in the world. He didn’t care who he sold the devices to or what they did with the money.“His skimmers went to organised crime groups and also probably funded terrorism. Card skimmers have previously been used by jihadis, people traffickers and arms dealers who supplied Middle Eastern terrorists.”Last night critics slammed the payment to Sovu - who is thought to have continued running his business in an industrial area in Shenzhen, mainland China, while living in Hong Kong.MP David Davies said: “I think I speak for all my former colleagues in the British Transport Police in saying how important it is that this man is brought to justice as quickly as possible“I am outraged that this inidual has taken £, in legal aid and has not even turned up to his own case.“He will presumably have vast assets from his criminal activities. Therefore it is vital that he is caught and stripped of his assets and his freedom as quickly as possible.”A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said: “We cannot comment on inidual cases but anyone found to have deliberately concealed or moved assets to qualy for legal aid will be ordered to pay back the money granted.“Victims are our priority and we must ensure that court cases continue to be able to proceed so that justice can be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This money, which the highly profitable tobacco industry can easily afford, could fund cash-strapped stop-smoking services and discourage young people from ever lighting up.The recommendations will also protect children by funding enforcement against underage sales and help tackle the trade in illicit cigarettes.Raising the age of sale from  to  will help stop experimentation from becoming a fatal habit and reinforce the dangers of tobacco.The next step is for the Government to show its commitment to achieving a smoke-free generation by adopting the full list of recommendations and turn them all into law."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473329623.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elon musk spacex crew dragon lands international space station","story":"It is expected to remain attached with the space station for five days before ing to Earth.The capsule is due to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean in the morning on March .The Falcon  rocket blasted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on time at .am, local time, on Saturday.The flight, which did not have a crew aboard, was a test to seeit possible to carry astronauts into space on a commercial spacecraft.Musk, , admitted to being emotionally exhausted after his SpaceX Crew Dragon rocketship blasted off.His company is working with NASA to resume sending US astronauts into space from American soil for the first time since .Speaking after the launch, Musk said the launch was super stressful to watch, but hes hopeful the capsule will be ready to carry people later this year.He said: To be frank, Im a little emotionally exhausted.We have to dock to the station.

Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres your -second guide. . Key demands for the Brexit deal could be dropped - and thatll make Tories furious  The Tory government has DROPPED a demand for a key change to the Brexit deal, it is reported today. MPs voted last month to send Theresa May back to renegotiate with Brussels over the Irish backstop, which could trap the UK under EU customs rules. She vowed to get either a time limit, exit clause or alternative arrangements. But today the Dailyreports demands for a time limit or exit clause have been dropped by the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is in Brussels this week. That will enrage Tory Brexiteers, who are likely to accuse the PM of going back on her word. Questioned on the reports today, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to deny the two demands have been dropped. He told the BBC: The attorney general continues with his work to ensure we get legally binding changes to ensure we’re not locked in the backstop. “That is fundamentally what this issue is about. Ensuring we are not trapped in this backstop arrangement which has caused so much concern, so much anxiety amongst my colleagues and Mps across the house.  Theresa May will today launch a pound.bn fund for “left behind” towns in a bid to win support for her Brexit deal. Much of the cash will be distributed to Leave-voting Labour heartlands to give communities a boost after leaving the EU. But angry Labour MPs accused the Prime Minister of offering a “shameless bung” to try to woo them to back her plans ahead of another vote. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell branded it a “desperate bribe” while a string of Labour MPs criticised her for only now trying to tackle “burning injustices”. Other MPs branded it a drop in the ocean as it emerged the entire fund will be spread over several YEARS right up until . It dwarfs the amount thats been slashed down the years through Tory austerity. Stoke Labour MP Ruth Smeeth told the BBCs Westminster Hour: “This is less money than is being taken out of my economy by the introduction of Universal Credit over the next four years. It’s an extraordinarily pathetic amount of money … A waste of time.”  Labours shadow cabinet needs to put its weight fully behind the push for a secondBrexitreferendum, the Independent Groupof MPs has said. The group, made up of MPs who quit Labour and Tory benches because ofBrexitand other issues, has said the opposition should show a more united front over a new EU withdrawal poll. In an open letter, TIG has called on members of the shadow cabinet to drop the terms and conditions it says Labour has attached to backing a bid for a new referendum. Accusing Labour of ambiguity on the issue, TIG has askedthe shadow cabinet will support a cross-party Commons amendment calling for a newBrexitpoll. TIGs spokesman Chuka Umunna said Labour needs to clary its stance. He said: With just  days to go to the scheduled date of departure, it is absolutely vital that we all work together in the national interest to give people the final say onBrexit. All terms and conditions attached to a peoples vote need to be dropped and an unequivocal commitment given now to make it happen. There is no time to waste.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is said to have dropped a push for certain changes to the Irish backstop - a clause in the -page Brexit deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules from .MPs voted last month to send Mrs May back to re-open talks with Brussels over the backstop. She vowed to get either a time limit, exit clause or alternative arrangements. But today the Dailyreports demands for a time limit or exit clause - which the EU always said were a non-starter - have been dropped by the Attorney General, who s to Brussels this week.   Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker told the newspaper it was a satirical approach to what MPs voted for. The Brady amendment required that you replace the backstop with alternative arrangements, he fumed. Thats light years away from tweaking arbitration mechanisms. Thealso reported that Mr Coxs approach falls short of demands by a key group of Tory Brexiteer lawyers, led by veteran MP Sir Bill Cash. Questioned on the reports today, Communities Secretary James Brokenshire refused to deny explicitly that the two demands have been dropped.  However, the Cabinet minister told the BBC: The attorney general continues with his work to ensure we get legally binding changes to ensure we’re not locked in the backstop. That is fundamentally what this issue is about. Ensuring we are not trapped in this backstop arrangement which has caused so much concern, so much anxiety amongst my colleagues and MPs across the house. Despite a potential backlash, there are growing signs that other Tory Brexiteer MPs will fall in line and back Theresa Mays deal. It is due to come to MPs for a final vote by March . If it fails, MPs will be given the chance to delay Brexit - a prospect that has made many furious.  Some Tory Brexiteers are now said to be looking for a ladder to climb down so they can U-turn with dignity. The ERG - the main group of Tory Brexiteers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg - has pulled together a document of its demands for a legally binding “mechanism” to escape the backstop. And Sir Graham Brady, the leader of Tory backbenchers  Committee, made clear he could swing behind the PM next week. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Sir Graham said: The whole country is tired of vacillation and delay. When the right compromise is offered, we should pull together behind the Prime Minister and help her to deliver our exit from the European Union on March .  Much depends on the  MPs of the DUP. If they fall in line it is thought many Tories would follow suit. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told the BBC: We need something which, whatever its legal form, has legal binding effect and which changes the current meaning of the Withdrawal Agreement. And which makes clear that it cannot be indefinite, and it cannot be a trap both for the United Kingdom generally and for Northern Ireland in particular. Askedhe would accept a codicil or appendix to the Withdrawal Agreement, or wanted the Agreement itself to be re-opened, Mr Dodds said: “It has to be treaty-level change. It has to be a change which isn’t some kind of subordinate document. But he added: “We want to get a deal. We certainly are not in the business of running down the clock to some kind of no deal scenario.” "},{"url":null,"title":"call join rally parliament bid","story":"NewsCall to join rally at Parliament in bid to keep TV licences free for over-sThe BBC is now consulting on means testing or scrapping the benefit from  - despite a Tory manesto pledge to keep them freeShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  MAR NewsThe Tories made a  manesto commitment not to axe free TV licences, worth £. annually \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of protesters will join a rally at Parliament this week to demand the Government protects free television licences for the over-s.

Now the minister, who has three children, is joining the Mirror in leading a national conversation to bring about a cultural sht so organ donation is seen as the normal thing to do.Last month, the Mirror-backed law to change to an opt-out system – where consent to donate organs is assumed – cleared its final hurdle in Parliament. In an exclusive interview at the launch of an NHS drive to train medics to speak to bereaved relatives about donation, he urged families to have the discussion so they are preparedthe worst happens.  Mr Hancock,  – who is tipped as a potential future Tory leader – has a -year-old daughter and two sons, aged  and five. Askedhe would donate his children’s organstragedy struck, Mr Hancock told the Mirror: “Yes, of course. It seems it’s the least you can do. It’s a no-brainer because in the event of a tragedy, the tragedy has happened already. What you can do is salvage a little and help stop others from going through the same tragedy. “For me, this is personal. I’ve seen the anguish and the turnaround in the le of not only the child but their whole family when an organ is made available.”  Mr Hancock explained that his son Ferdie’s best friend had a transplant after being born with a defect where the partition meant to separate the heart into four chambers had not developed. Oliver Flint, , was told in  that he would die without a new heart. He got a donor organ in November . Mr Hancock said: “I care deeply that we get as many donors as possible. “Not least because the child of a close personal friend’s le was saved by the donation of a heart. I have lived with this friend through the anguish of waiting for a donation as their child got weaker and weaker, and I’ve seen the amazing turnaround when the donation happened.  “These donations come from tragedies, but at least talking to the parents of donor children you see the real positives that can be brought out of such tragedy.” Mr Hancock lives with his we, Martha, who is an osteopath, in Little Thurlow in his West Suffolk constituency. He said: “My we and I were both on the register before we met. “With our children, it has become a live issue because of what happened to my son. “We have seen just how important it is that the donations are made. We know the value of being on the register because we have lived through it with our friends. “People talk about the dficult conversations, but the truly awful conversation is the one when a doctor needs to say to parents that their child isn’t going to survive. The conversation about whether their organs are donated is much easier.  “It is heartbreaking that hundreds of very ill children and babies are waiting for an organ right now, and that last year  families went through the unimaginable pain of losing a child while they are waiting for a le-saving organ.” He added: “I completely understand how dficult it is to even contemplate losing a child, let alone think about what happens afterwards. But we must not shy away from this dficult, and potentially le-saving, conversation. Hundreds of young lives were saved last year because of the selfless actions of  families. “To allow your child to live on through saving the lives of others might bring some comfort in a terrible moment.”  After a three-year campaign by the Mirror, a change to donation law was last week confirmed by the House of Lords. The new opt-out system will assume everyone consents to be a donor unless they state otherwise. The Organ Donation Bill will get royal assent and become official this month. It could come in to force before the end of the year. The law will be named Max And Keira’s Law after campaigning heart transplant recipient Max Johnson, , and his donor, Keira Ball, nine. Mr Hancock said: “This is the piece of legislation I’m most proud of since I’ve become Health Secretary. I’m determined to turn it from law in to action as soon as possible.” Dr John Chisholm, British Medical Association ethics chairman, said: “It is very welcome to see the Health Secretary has given his support to this important campaign, which focuses on improving organ donation rates for children.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stop asking women can until","story":"NewsopinionStop asking uswomen can have it all until you ask men the same questionIn honour of International Women’s Day, we’ve asked one of our favourite Labour MPs, Jess Phillips, to guest write our First Things First column in Notebook Magazine...ShareByJess Phillips:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionJess says its a given women should be able to have it all \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI get asked all the timeI think that my generation of women can have it all. The question itself is infuriating because what they mean is can a woman have a job, a partner and a family. Having it all seems a pretty low bar. When I was a little girl I dreamed of being a leader, an explorer, or seeing the world and feeling every emotion in bright technicolour. Having it all for a woman is essentially having exactly what men have always expected as the norm. It is pretty basic.   That said, I do recognise for women today we have better opportunities than my mum had. Generations of feminists have fought for better childcare options, equal pay and services to protect women from violence at home and work. Things are better and we should pay tribute to the trailblazing women who went before. I know that those trailblazing women, like the suffragettes, like the pilloried women of the s and the women who opened the first women’s refuges in the s would not want me to swoon with gratitude for how far we’ve come, they would want me to keep on demanding more.   Domestic and sexual violence are now far less socially acceptable than they used to be. But polling has shown that many in the general public think the #metoo movement has gone too far, somewhat suggesting we still think women should have to put up with a certain level of sexual harassment at work without complaint. Rape convictions remain low between -% and still two women are murdered every week at the hands of a partner or family member in the UK. Attitudes have not shted far enough or fast enough to actually keep women safe.  Where I work huge progress has been made, with women representing now a third of all Members of Parliament, unthinkable  years ago.

But there was a big catch. His future in-laws insisted that he dress as a woman for the wedding. And Roy would have to keep up the pretence for months afterwards. This was because the British Sikh fshyamily didn’t want anyone to know their son was gay. Roy was so lovestruck he accepted the conditions and moved into their house in London. But he ended up trying to kill himself after nine months of abuse including shybeing ordered to wear a wig and high heels. Roy, now , met his future shyhusband when he was  at a family wedding. He recalled: “He started singing love songs to me and told me I had a beautul smile. Later he made a move and we kissed.” The pair started dating in secret as Roy was afraid his own Sikh family would disown himthey found out.   He said: “Two years later he asked me to marry him. I thought this was my very own fairytale love story.” Days later Roy received a call from his future mother-in-law. “We met up on our own,” he explained. “It was the first time I’d met her. “She said I was very good-looking and her son had chosen well. “But she told me that she comes from a big Indian family and there’s a lot of honour involved. “She saidI wanted to marry him I would have to dress as a woman on the wedding day. I would also need to pretend to be a woman for a while to convince the community her son isn’t gay.” He added: “I was gobsmacked. I thought, ‘How did that even come into her head ’ She had even brought a basket of women’s clothes and gold bracelets with her.” After agonising over the weird shyarrangement, Roy agreed. “I knew it was going to be dficult us being together as LGBTQ isn’t talked about in the Asian community,” he said. “I hadn’t even told my own family. But I just wanted to be with him and I would have done anything.”  Roy, who comes from Manchester, told his parents he was moving to London for work. In reality, he was living with his partner in his in-laws’ house in the capital and, as the big day drew nearer, he became ever more nervous. “Me and his mum would go shopping for the shywedding and she would tell me I was going to be her best friend. “Yet she never asked what I wanted. She chose everything. I couldn’t even pick the date. She just asked for money so I sold my brand new car and gave her pound, to pay for it all.” During the wedding at the family’s house, Roy nearly fainted from fear of being found out. “She told everyone in the community I was a widow and an orphan so I had no guests. I was forced to dress as a bride because they couldn’t accept a gay wedding. “This was supposed to be the best day of my le – it was the worst day of my le. “There were  people staring at me and only nine people knew the truth. “They all kept saying, ‘She’s so shybeautul’, and, ‘Does she have any sisters for our sons ’ “I was thinking, ‘Come on, you’re shypulling my leg here’. “My heart was beating so fast. I thought they were going to find out I was a man. But no one asked any questions. Luckily I was able to wear a veil for the majority of the ceremony.”   The next day Roy was told he would be called Lucky in future – and was not allowed to be seen without high-heels, full make-up and jewellery. “My mum-in-law started calling me her daughter-in-law,” he said. “There was a time when I came down in slippers, not really dressed. She said I needed to maintain myself at all times and never come down again like that. “I was so confused as it was just me and her in the house. “I kept thinking, ‘Does she not realise I’m a man and this is fake ’” Roy said she treated him “worse than Cinderella”, making him work  hours a day doing demeaning domestic chores. He was criticised for over-salting food and claimed he was once locked in a cupboard as a punishment. She also restricted his toilet breaks so that he would often wet himself. “I needed to be up at am to cook the breakfast. I had to cook all three meals a day. But I wasn’t allowed to eat. “She would tell me I was too fat and I wouldn’t pass as a woman.”  He became malnourished on just a bowl of Weetabix and a smoothie a day. Roy sought comfort in his husband, who he still loved, but says they barely had any time together. He recalled: “He didn’t see what was going on and we argued about it shyconstantly.” Then Roy’s partner started shycalling him his we, buying him lingerie and shyexpensive jewellery. Roy’s own parents found out his secret and disowned him when snaps of the wedding appeared on Facebook , exposing Roy as the bride pictured. His mum-in-law forced him to visit them dressed as Lucky. He said: “She wanted to sit down with my family and tell them what had shyhappened. They took it really badly and told me never to come home again.” Roy finally found the courage to leave his husband and in-laws after nine months. He said: “Sometimes I would look at myself in the shymirror and think, ‘Who is this person looking back at me ’ “I wanted to rip the clothes and wig off. I was dying inside. Roy eventually left with nowhere to go and ended up in a homeless shelter. At first he was relieved to be wearing men’s clothes again. But he added: “I felt out of place when I stopped dressing as a woman. I didn’t know who I was any more.” Four months later he tried to kill shyhimself after he found out his husband was set to marry a woman.  He said: “We would still have shyconversations on the phone and I would cry for him. But he told me he had to marry someone  – and he did it while he was still married to me. “Mine was a big lavish love story and it had turned into a nightmare. “I put my wedding outfit back on and I went down to the river and slashed my wrists. I felt like they made me his we so I was going to kill the we. I wanted to die in that way so they would have seen me die as his we.” A passer-by dragged Roy from the water and he was taken to a hospital, who called his parents. “They took me back home,” he said. “No matter what, when a parent sees a child in that state it makes them see they have to stand by you.” Now Roy performs in drag as ‘Miss Lucky’ in a bid to reclaim his identity. He said: “I wanted to take ownership of what happened. This is my way of shydoing that.” But the scars remain. He said: “I still can’t sleep. Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night and see her face. I shout ‘I’m not a woman.’ I never want this to happen to anyone .” Roy’s ex, who has not been named, said: “Me and my mum would like to apologise to Roy Lucky Singh.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 11 surfs back moving","story":"NewsBoy, , surfs on back of moving TRAM in horrying footageMobile phone footage shows the boy jumping onto the tracks as his two friends waited at the  in ManchesterShareCommentsByTfany LoRebecca Day:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video onlookers-shocked-child-goes-tram-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young boy was caught dangerously surfing on the back of a moving TRAM. Onlooker Claire McGuire captured the moment the child - believed to be about  years old - was towed away. The shocking scenes were witnessed at Barlow Moor Road station in Manchester on March . Ms McGuire said the youngster was with two other friends, who were told off by an elderly woman following the stunt, reported Manchester Evening News . They had been on the tram and they all got off at the stop. One of them jumped onto the back , she said. Imaginethe tram had to brake. Its dangerous. If something happened it would affect the driver, and their family. Kids are getting really bad these days.  Its reported that this is not the first time teenagers have been spotted tram-surfing in the region. Last July, a group of teenagers were spotted grabbing onto the front of a moving tram near Manchester Victoria station. Another two youngsters were pictured wedged on the coupling in between two carriages. A link spokesman said the TravelSafe Partnership is aware of a small but continued number of incidents of tram surfing on the link network. The spokesman said they have taken a number of steps to crack down on the problem, including undertaking work with the operator, delivering briefings to staff, and launching a more robust enforcement of the link by-laws.  Head of link Danny Vaughan, said: This type of reckless behaviour could very easily result in death or very serious injury and I would urge people to stay safe and not be tempted into risking their lives in this way. One slip could lead to a tragedy and the last thing we want is someone’s child not coming home because they took a needless risk. We do run a comprehensive youth engagement programme warning young people about the dangers and consequences of this type of behaviour but unfortunately there remains a small number of people who seem determined to risk their lives. Our staff are vigilant, but I would urge anyone who sees something like this to let us know as soon as possible and help ensure nobody gets hurt.

Delivery driver Mark Given, , was given a penalty by French courier DPD boss after he pulled out of a sht on a day he should have been off. The father of two quit his job following a row in . However, the parcel giant has now taken the issue to the courts to fight for fine and other charges, which Given claims has destroyed his credit rating and left him unable to get a mortgage. He said: Its disgusting how Ive been treated. I had no idea Id still be counting the cost of working for DPD so long after I left. My credit score has been left in tatters following this action. Ive been told Ill never qualy for a mortgage now. We were desperate to move with our growing family.  According to The Sunday Mail, the last available company accounts for DPD in  show the highest paid director, which is understood to be CEO Dwain McDonald, earned pound,. The report also exposes the case as part of a campaign to shame Scotlands horrible bosses, who have been getting away with mistreating hard-working staff for years. The row between Mr Given and DPD centres on his last day of work for the company - a Sunday he had meant to be off. Its said the managers at the Tannochside depot centre in South Lanarkshire changed Mr Givens route at the last minute, meaning he was expected to work for  hours instead six. Mr Given quit right away after taking them to task and they refused to back down. DPD then handed a pound penalty to Mr Given for failing to do the new route. But then added further charges including disputed costs to cover damage to his van.  months later, the driver received a legal letter from the company stating that they had taken him to court and had been awarded cash owed in his absence.   Mr Given claimed it was not the first time that he had been handed a breach charge of pound during his -month spell at DPD. He was also fined for his absence in May  when his daughter, Isabella, then two years old, had been rushed to hospital after she began coughing up blood. The firm has been mentioned in subjects of mistreating workers in recent years, according to the report. Its stated most of the drivers have self-employed status, which unions describe as bogus. DPD vowed to change its policy following the death of one of their drivers who was linked to a pound charge. Don Lane,, who suffers from Diabetes, told of his fear of being fined that he missed important hospital appointments. Dons partner, Ruth, has claimed that DPD continues to fail workers. She said: Im not surprised when I hear stories like this - its DPDs default position to kick a worker when hes down. A spokesman for DPD said Mr Given had been fined under old rules that have since been changed, and claimed the vehicle he had hired from DPD had not been ed in a good state.

Dannii Harwood - who once sang in the same choir as Welsh singing sensation Katherine Jenkins - has a huge network of followers, and has revealed some of the more unusual requests she receives.Speaking to Wales Online , she said she explores dferent fetishes every day, and men are happy to pay.But it has made for some awkward encounters when punters recognise her.On OnlyFans, a website where subscribers pay for content described as “ Instagram without the PG- rating”, she has around , subscribers, each of them paying . a month.On top of that, they can request and pay for specic content. The fee goes up depending on how unusual or creative the request gets. But it doesnt necessarily follow that more money means more explicit. “I had an unusual request the other day,” says Dannii.  “A guy had this fetish for the parting in your hair and he wanted me to film a one-minute video of me sliding my fingers through my hair after having it blow-dried — fully-clothed, no naughty talk, just literally looking up, saying his name and running my fingers through my hair. “He paid  for that. People pay a lot of money for things they can’t find for free on the internet.” It does, of course, get more sexual than that. But its this sort of personalised content where she makes the most money. Just this morning, someone tipped her . “My page is not about explicitness. I do go to nude, I do show, but that’s not what sells the most,” she says. “If people want to see hardcore pornography, they just go on the internet and they’d get that for free. That’s not what my page is about. My page is about interaction, personalising my content to suit each guy, offering so much dferent stuff like games and fetishes that it appeals to a lot of people. I try to keep it tasteful, even though I show my body.”Dannii is prolic on her OnlyFans page, as well as on her Instagram and Twitter pages, which have more than , followers each and serve as her only means of marketing the website where she actually makes her money.She uploads around  pictures and a short video every day, and every other day will post a longer, more revealing video, something like a a striptease to full nude. She does theme days, and days where shell explore a dferent fetish. One of her most popular days is Tuesdays Dare Dannii, where men submit dares and she chooses around three to carry out.  One involved her answering the door completely naked to a pizza delivery guy . Another man wanted her to film herself dressing and undressing as many times as she could in the changing rooms of River Island. In another dare, she drove around town in her white Maserati wearing only underwear. It takes up all of her time. “The only time I’m not on my page isI’m asleep or I’m shooting content,” she says. And it pays extraordinarily well. She made ,in November and, half way through February, had already made , . As the content creator, she takes % of what she makes, while % goes to OnlyFans. Its a level of income she never dreamed of when she helped set the website up in , when a friend approached her with the idea, saying he needed her help. She agreed to set up a pageand made  in her first month. She agreed to spread the word, which she did by telling her then-colleagues at Babestation, the adult TV chat channel, and by posting on Twitter and Instagram.  And spread it has. Possibly the most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie, from Australia, who has around , subscribers paying  a month to see her pose in bikinis or squatting in tight leggings. Another is Chanel Santini, a -year-old from New Mexico who, according to the New York Times, got thrown out of her house after coming out as transgender when she was a teenager. She started doing porn, then escorting, to make ends meet, dealing with threats of violence along the way. When OnlyFans came along, she signed up, going from shooting porn scenes for  a time to making , a month from subscribers. Porn and escorting are two things Dannii says she would never consider. “I’ve never been personally exploited, I’ve always felt very much in control my whole career,” she says. “However, I have come across lots of girls who’ve been underpaid for work they’ve felt obligated to take on. I’ve never, ever gone into escort work, it’s something I wouldn’t do. That’s too far for me, though I don’t judge anybody that does it. I’ve never needed to. And OnlyFans has been a way to give the girls who felt they had no other option to make more money.” Dannii grew up in Neath. Her dad is a forklt driver and her mum worked for the DVLA before she retired recently. She went to Alderman Davies Church in Wales Primary School and sang in the St Davids Church choir, standing next to Katherine Jenkins.  She was bullied quite badly in school, the result, she thinks, of being “a bit of a swot” who loved school and would never misbehave, instead devoting her time to dancing, talent shows and performing in pantomimes in the local theatre when they came around. At , she got a scholarship to Laine Theatre Arts, an independent performing arts college in Surrey. She finished college when she was  and started trying to get work as a professional dancer, going to audition after audition in London while doing ious jobs including cleaning and teaching dance on the side. “I really wanted to break into the West End, that was my dream,” she says. “I tried it for two or three years and it was getting so expensive and taking a whole day. I remember walking around London with my A-Z and Tube map.” She got to the final stage of auditions for We Will Rock You, the Queen musical, with Brian May on the judging . “It was a dancing role but they asked us to sing,” she says. “I can sing in tune but I’m no way a West End singer and I didn’t get the job and that hit me like a tonne of bricks because I thought I was going to make it and get the job. But I didn’t get it and I thought ‘You know what, I give up’. I had tried and it just wasn’t working.” It was at this point that her journey into the glamour and adult industry began. Changing her focus to acting and other areas of the performing arts, she got some cards made that she could hand out at any future auditions. She needed a photo to include on them and booked a shoot. The photographer told her she had a “really great glamour look” and askedhe could put the pictures forward for modelling work. Then she started getting job offers.  “The first job offer I got was a test shoot for Page  for The Sun, which I didn’t want to do because I didn’t want to get my boobs out,” she says. “I was really quite shy back then.” She started getting promotional work, did hosiery modelling for Marks and Spencer, a TV advert for Sky Sports and ended up as the face of the Golden Tee arcade golf machine.When models like Katie Price and magazines like Maxim, Zoo and Nuts were at their height, she won an “implied nude” competition in one of them after an ex-boyfriend sent her pictures in. The job offers for Page  became more frequent and eventually she went for it, appearing first in the Daily Sport, where she then appeared virtually every day for months, getting pound for each photo shoot.But she hadnt told her parents. In fact, her dad found out when he went into work at the factory one day and saw a topless picture of his daughter stuck to his locker. “They knew I was doing promotional work but I hadn’t told them about the topless work,” she says. “I think my dad was pretty embarrassed to be fair. I’m his daughter. I don’t think any parent wants to see their child with their boobs out on page  of a newspaper, particularly a father. “It was a shock for him. I wasn’t a rebellious child, I was a very well brought-up child and I did well at school so there were no signs or hints to my dad that I might start rebelling and do something crazy.  “I felt bad. I don’t regret it now but back then I wished that I had either told him first or at least used a dferent name so it was a bit less in your face for my dad. In the beginning we wouldn’t really speak about my work — it’s not really appropriate — but as time went on and I was doing more serious work, getting contracts, buying a car and a house and becoming more successful, he became more and more proud and doesn’t hide it. “My mum spent most of her adult le running me around from dance class to gymnastics to acrobatics to singing, drama, piano. And I suppose I felt really guilty that I didn’t then go on to become that dancer that she so wanted me to be. And there were friends who stopped talking to me and went a little bit funny with my parents because of my work and it was a little bit awkward. “It’s dferent now because I’ve been doing it so long and my mum’s really proud of how well I’ve done but at the time we didn’t really discuss it. It was avoided.” After the newspaper and magazine work, she worked on a couple of “more fetish-based” websites and non-adult daytime chat channels before starting a night-time “Dom Dannii Show”, where “I could be in the night-time but not expose my body as much — I’d be completely covered up but be a mistress on TV”. The first show of its type on TV, it was very popular for a time, before closing down. Dannii moved to Playboy TV in  and toured Europe as a Playboy Bunny, before moving to Babestation, which is now probably the best-known channel of its kind in the UK. Viewers pay to be able to call and speak to the girls they can see on the TV. The later in the day, the fewer clothes they have on. She left Babestation in October to concentrate on OnlyFans, which has been described as having “changed sex work forever” by putting adult entertainment in the hands of the people featuring in it. “In the adult industry it’s a really good way to customise content to whatever the subscriber wants — he will ask me for it, I can put my price on it,” says Dannii, who offers a VIP badge to her most active subscribers. Its these men who spend the most money and to whom she speaks most and knows best. VIP membership means they get a free phone call once a month, and maybe a picture as a thank you.  “Being able to contact me is free, as part of my subscription. I’m in direct contact with these guys on a daily basis,” she says. “If they were then to request a picture of my feet or a fetish or something a little more explicit than I’d usually show on my main page then I’d attach a price to that or ask them how much they’d be prepared to pay.” Although she says its rare, occasionally someone crosses the line, including last week when a subscriber sent her a message telling her he couldnt stop looking at her page and wanted to spend the rest of his le with her. “I was honest and I said ‘I’m really flattered you feel that way but you’ve never met me, it’s lust, not love and you can’t lose sight of what this is. You’re never going to meet me or have a relationship with me’. If anyone does go like that I will put them right straight away.” Does that worry her  “Yeah, sometimes,” she says. “But I would get more incidents like that when I was working on the channels. I haven’t experienced anything I’ve been overly concerned about on OnlyFans yet. “There might be something in the future and it has happened with other girls I know where some guys get too attached. But I’ve been in the industry for quite a long time and I’m clear with the guys and I’ve never had any major problems.” There are also incidents where shes recognised while going about her day, which are less sinister but can be awkward. “I was having a coffee the other day and this guy came up to me, with his girlfriend, and he was asking me ‘Where do I know you from ’ And I was thinking ‘It’s going to come to you any minute and you’re just going to shut up and walk off’. “You can see people thinking ‘I know you from somewhere’ and then they realise and their expression changes.” After getting her shoot done for Mistress Monday, Dannii is packing to head off to Jamaica for a trip that will be part-holiday, part-work. Shes taking the person who takes most of her photos, and paying for her. Its an extraordinary lestyle for someone making her living on a website thats not even close to being a household name, nowhere near the level of Instagram, YouTube or even pornography websites like PornHub. “I pinch myself on a daily basis,” she says. “Never in a million years did I think this would be so successful. I thought I’d have a few years left on the Babe channels and fizzle out and retire. “I cleaned houses and pub toilets to fund auditions, earning pound. an hour. And I went from that to earning this money. It’s all new to me and I’m still trying to adjust to it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gran five 40 dubbed queen","story":"NewsGran-of-five, , dubbed Queen of Sex behind towns booming massage parlour sceneThe woman, known only as Dion, left her religious upbringing behind her to chase a career in prostitution in GrimsbyShareByDavid Coleman:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsDion left her religious background to pursue a career in the sex trade \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the grandmother-of-five dubbed the Queen of Sex believed to be behind the booming massage parlour scene in a town. Newcastle gran Dion, who claims to be , has built her own adult services empire in Grimsby, it is claimed. The entrepreneurial former pound-a-hour call girl is behind a number of adult-only massage parlours, it emerged today. Grimsby Live claim she is the boss of Top Notch Massage, the unassuming Grimsby terraced house exposed as a sex den back in August. Business there is busier than ever and Dion has now been linked to a brand-new parlour known as Desire Massage to help meet demand. A string of sources revealed to Grimsby Live Dions love of cash, saucy exploits and religious roots.  Married Dion described herself as a Hull-based escort who loves to please on an online profile last active a year ago. Hi im Dion a blonde Geordie, reads the profile, a sexy  yr old with long blonde hair, green eyed very tanned and toned size   with a enhanced gg bust. First class at sex, her profile offers  dferent sexual services including domination, exhibitionism and sex parties. Flaunting herself in leotards, strappy dresses and even just knickers, she promises to meet any fetish - for a price. It costs pound an hour to book in the very outgoing and bubbly prostitute who brazenly bears her surgically-enhanced, bare bosom in photos. Dions early le makes her promiscuous antics as a prostitute and later brothel owner particularly unexpected.   Brought up in a strictly religious household, she dramatically abandoned her faith aged  in favour of a le in the sex industry, studiously working her way to the top of Grimsbys sex underworld. Brought up in Newcastle, family sources told Grimsby Live her upbringing was extremely disciplined. One of five children, she left the North-east after recanting her religion and zig zagged across the country, finally arriving in Hull where she turned to prostitution. One of her punters, now a married businessman, told us he first encountered Dion under the sheets three years ago. She moved to Grimsby and away from the physical side of the industry a year later, he said, to fulfil the dream of owning her own establishment. Inspiration came from a friend in Hull who made a living running a brothel in the city. Bidding to build a smart, clean, high-class establishment, Dion wanted her Grimsby parlour to grow into Humbersides best.   Dion found luck with her opulently-decorated terrace den operating largely unnoticed until Grimsby Live blew the lid. Our anonymous parlour visitor described le-long working girl Dion as outgoing and a shrewd operator who used her experience to build Top Notch into one of the regions busiest, cleanest and best parlours. To be fair, the reason why Top Notch is dead busy is because its probably one of the best ones, he said. She runs a very clean establishment. But others who spoke to Grimsby Live were much less complimentary about the sex boss. One source, who worked with Dion, said the very feisty businesswoman would always get her own way. She appears to be nice but shes very manipulative, said the source. It is her way or no way. And one thing seems clear: Dion wants to make her businesses successful - and profitable.   The source said: She loves money. said the source. She always splashed out at Christmas and had a taste for finer things in le. The legal situation surrounding prostitution in the UK can be confusing. Prostitution in itself is legal, when it comes to the simple act of exchanging sexual activities for money. But many of the activities that surround prostitution are illegal, such as soliciting sex on the street, running a brothel and pimping. Grimsby Live spoke to Dion, who offered a range of contradictory explanations when asked about her activities. She accepted that she had run Top Notch but went on to claim she had now passed it on to another inidual.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their first child in Spring  and while many have been speculating about the royal baby, there is one thing we know for sure. He or she will not be a prince nor a princess unless the Queen steps in. Thats because King George V - Harrys great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in . This means Harry and Meghans first born, as a great-grandchild of the Queen, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH. The baby will be seventh in the line, pushing Princess Eugenie to th place.   George V declared that: The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male lineshall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms. The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his fathers lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debretts. So a first son of Harrys would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be LadyMountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons LordMounbatten-Windsor.  Sometimes the Queen does make changes to allow children to be HRHs and princes and princesses. Ahead of Prince Georges birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles. Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince. The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghans baby, but has not yet done so.  The duke may choose to heed the words of his cousin Zara Tindall when discussing such matters with the Queen, and deciding which titles his child should use. Zara, who was born Miss Zara Phillips, has spoken of how not having a title was a blessing. Ive been very lucky. My parents didnt give us titles, so weve been able to have a slightly more normal upbringing. As soon as youve got a title, its very dficult to shed it, she said. Harry too has told of the pressures of being a prince and has always stressed the importance of being seen as normal. He confessed in  that he once wanted out of the Royal Family. Harry said the time he spent in the Army - when he was just Harry - was the best escape Ive ever had and he once considered giving up his title.   Aside from discussion of titles, much has been talked about lately in regards to reports that the couple plans to raise the baby as gender fluid. However, Kensington Palace has said that those reports, which emerged in Vanity Fair magazine, are totally . The baby shower itself was also the topic of much scrutiny, with some analysing every little detail for clues as to what the sex of the unborn child may be. Some thought the food at the shower may signy the couple are expecting a girl, as there was a lot of light, pastel and pink shades. However some royal fans on social media are convinced they will have a boy - as one guest arrived at the shower carrying a blue gt bag. The pair are unlikely to officially confirm the gender until after the baby is born.

The eight-year-old, named only as Sebastian, was with other fossil hunters scouring the clf-face rocks along so-called Jurassic Coast in Dorset. The boy was taking part in one of Charmouth Heritage Coast Centres fossil walks on Charmouth Beach when young Seb found the tooth, from a ft tall woolly mammoth. Bigger than elephants, they plodded about during the Ice Age but gradually died out and became extinct. Alison Ferris, the centres deputy senior warden, said: It is an unusual find because our layers here are Jurassic, approximately  million years old, and mammoths are obviously not Jurassic. The tooth would have washed out from possibly the river from now-eroded layers from the last Ice Ages. As part of the West Dorset Fossil Collecting Code, it is an important find because it is rare for this area.   We usually find Jurassic fossils here from a marine environment, whereas this fossil represents a whole dferent terrestrial environment in a dferent age. It helps to piece together a little more of what Dorset could have been like thousands of years ago and what kind of animals were living here. We cant be sure where the tooth came from -it has travelled down the river, how far  But other Ice Age fossils have been found locally, such as the Honiton Hippo, so we know these animals would have been roaming in Dorset and Devon. It is great that anyone can help find these fossils and Sebastian did so in a safe place, following the collecting code of conduct. You dont have to be a professional collector to make these amazing discoveries.  Sebastian decided to retain his find and a photo of the tooth was sent to the centres Ice Age fossil expert, who said that although it was dficult to tell the exact age, it was likely around , years old. Professor Danielle Schreve, Royal Holloway University of London and patron of Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre, said It is part of a mammoth molar - I think eight enamel plates although it is hard to tell from the photo. It is very battered and worn so I am afraid I cant say more as to whether it is an upper or lower tooth, or indeed which tooth it is. However, it is definitely a woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, and therefore, although it could be as old as , years, the first appearance of this species in Britain, it is much more likely to date to the period between , and , years ago, the Middle Devensian, when these animals were very common in Britain, and , years old would therefore be a reasonable estimate.

Campaigners say Spain has , registered galgos and around a quarter of them are abandoned at the end of each season. Owners throw the dogs down wells and block the entrances so they cant escape.  Anna Clements leads a campaign to save these greyhounds and told Mail Online: This is Spains dirty secret and something tourists rarely see.We are expecting an influx of thousands of abandoned dogs but we, and other charities, cannot cope. We cannot save them all. They are brutally treated when the hunters have finished with them - some are thrown down wells and the well opening is blocked off with wood. But some survive and we had one recently who was saved when a passerby heard her cries. She was lying in water at the bottom of the well, was badly malnourished and had deep gashes on her neck. The fire brigade was able to winch her to safety and she is now recovering with a family where she is a loved pet. These working dogs are a distant relative of British greyhounds and are used for hunting and coursing.   This is where two dogs compete to to run down a hare over open land. Galgos that dont compete well are then discarded by their shamed owners. Because theyre regarded as working dogs, they dont come under Spains legislation on the protection of pets.  Footage shows a dog being rescued from a well in Toleda,  miles south west from Madrid, but happily the galgo is now living with a family in Barcelona. Anna says people should be more outraged by the practise but she says its a long-held tradition in some rural areas and some people are too scared to speak out. This cruelty is not what tourists see but the government is slow to take action because the hunting lobby is so powerful, she said.

Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park. I had actually planned it as a practice run before I cycle from London to Paris and back via Guernsey in the summer, but this might be an even bigger task.“That said, my biggest challenge could be surviving the weekend with Pat before I set off on the bike!”Once he’s on his way, Steve will complete the journey in stages and take in Brentford games at Middlesbrough and Sheffield United before arriving at Grfin Park just in time for the clash with West Brom later this month.And thanks to the support he’s already receiving, he hopes to pass a personal milestone with his fund- raising efforts.“I got into cycling a few years back and I’ve done a charity ride to Amsterdam to raise money. It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee.

Gary Mackay-Steven recovered from a knock to start with Niall McGinn dropping to the bench.Left-back Max Lowe gave the hosts a further boost by shaking off a knee problem, which had forced him off against Accies, to start.After a cagey opening Aberdeen hit the front from the penalty spot on  minutes.The spot-kick was awarded in the ninth minute when Lowe robbed James Tavernier on the left, Lowe drove forward and slipped the ball through for Mackay-Steven who was scythed down by Connor Goldson on the slide.Referee Kevin Clancy had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and after a two minute delay while Mackay-Steven got treatment Cosgrove stepped up and fired the ball into the bottom right corner with his right foot despite Allan McGregor getting a touch on the effort.The Gers tried to respond and shortly after Alfredo Morelos got the run on Andy Considine, but his low shot from the right side of the box was saved by Joe Lewis at the front post.On the quarter hour the Colombian striker was booked for a blatant e in the area with Considine at his back and seconds later Mackay-Steven had to be withdrawn, the winger still suffering after Goldson#s challenge which resulted in the penalty, McGinn came on.It was fine display from the Reds in the opening half an hour as they got on top of Rangers and didn#t give them a chance to play.In the nd minute it was nearly two when Greg Stewart#s free-kick from the left found Scott McKenna at the back post and his header was tipped over by McGregor.However the Dons were given a warning for minutes later. Tavernier appeared to trip Cosgrove on the edge of the box, but Clancy didn#t give it and Rangers broke upfield.Ryan Kent was sent clear down the left but Dom Ball chased back and did enough to cause him to lash high and wide.In first half stoppage time Ball made a timely intervention when Scott Arfield took advantage of Lewis Ferguson to find Tavenier, his low ball into the area looked like it would find Morelos but Ball came across to clear.After an excellent first half the Dons started the second period poorly and Rangers were level within three minutes.Stewart gave away a needless corner on the left after overplay and from Kent#s inswinging delivery Worrall was completely free at the back post to volley home from six yards.Aberdeen were rattled and on  minutes Lowe made a crucial challenge to deny Kent after he burst through two tackles.There was another warning just before the hour when the Govan side broke from an Aberdeen corner. Daniel Candeias sprinted down the right and intelligently played the ball for Kent on the left side of the area, the winger teed up Arfield who lted a shot over the bar.On  minutes there was a scramble in the Gers box from a McGinn corner McKenna had a header blocked and a Cosgrove shot was also thwarted before the ball was smuggled away.The game was becoming more fraught as it entered the last  minutes with players on both sides flinging themselves into tackles.On  minutes the Dons were wondering how they weren#t in front. McGinn swirled in a free-kick from the right, McKenna won the header, Ball hooked it across goal and then Considine#s low strike was saved by the foot of McGregor.Both teams were trying to win the tie in a frenetic finale, with two minutes of the  left Considine made a magnicent block to stop Morelos converting from Kent#s corner on the left.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Dominic Ball, Scott McKenna, Andy Considine, Max Lowe, Lewis Ferguson, Graeme Shinnie, Connor McLennan , Greg Stewart, Gary Mackay-Steven , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Stephen Gleeson, Stevie May, Michael Devlin, Dean Campbell.Rangers: Allan McGregor, James Tavernier, Joe Worrall, Connor Goldson, Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack, Glen Kamara, Scott Arfield, Daniel Candeias, Alfredo Morelos, Ryan Kent.Subs not used: Wes Foderingham, Jermain Defoe, Kyle Lafferty, Andy Halliday, Ross McCrorie, Nikola Katic, Lassana Coulibaly."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/SNS-18370543-Dons-v-Gers-e1549539860266-794x564.jpg ","title":"scott mckenna too sharp for needle match says joe lewis","story":"Joe Lewis insists team-mate Scott McKenna won’t repeat the mistake he made the last time Aberdeen played Rangers.Centre-back McKenna was sent off for retaliation during the - Premiership defeat at Pittodrie last month.The Scotland international kicked out at Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos after the Colombian – who was also sent off – had stamped on him.McKenna is set to start today#s Scottish Cup quarter-final tie between the Reds and Gers at Pittodrie and Lewis says the defender won’t be affected by his dismissal.The goalkeeper said: “Discipline can be important and it’s unlike Scott to act like he did in the last game.“He put his hand up after the game and said he’d made a mistake.“We move on because he is not a player who will do that again and I’m convinced of that.“If Scott is back in the team he will be looking to make amends by making sure the defensive performance is very good.“He’s a great guy, Scott.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"a look back at the centenary celebrated in 1959","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Centenary Week was held in  in celebration of  years since the founding of our town.With the joining of the roads to Oban, Inveraray and Campbeltown making for a convenient settlement, a petition was signed by  householders # , people # to make the village of Lochgilphead a burgh.The elected commissioners had their first meeting on May , .The th anniversary celebrations included a long list of events # a parade led by Provost A.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14082974.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/2_SexBeast.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

South Ayrshire Council’s attempts to open a pound million market have been hit by more inactivity. Bosses claim they are now targeting a May opening date – almost two years later than scheduled.

An initial revival date of September  was promised when council chiefs began their transformation of the site. Last February former Ayr Renaissance boss David Bell said: David Bell said: “Work is scheduled to be complete in late spring this year, when we’ll open the ground floor as a market square to help create a busy new attraction for Ayr town centre.” But the finished article has never materialised.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March .

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

However, local people and businesses are encouraged to get involved to help promote Hoggrsquos Borders legacy.Internationally, the anniversary will be celebrated in Washington DC.Enthusiasts can attend an event held in the Library of Congress where they will be talking about Hoggrsquos le and Borderrsquos traditions.Stirling University is known as the world centre of Hoggs work.And they are currently doing a project to collect all the poets work and republish it. So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

No-one has ever done a double take head move better than the boy from Larbert. Una McLeanScottish acting royalty McLean, from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire, can turn her hand to comedy sketch shows, panto, serious theatre and film. She is currently appearing in BBC Scotland drama series River City. Her career began at the Byre Theatre in St Andrews in  and in , she starred in Scotlands first one-woman television show, Did You See Una  Chic MurrayThe Godfather of surrealist comedy  Probably. Murray also had a free range style that allowed for music hall gags \"kippers ndash fish that like a lot of sleep\" and the rather more philosophical. \"Get into yourself to get yourself out of your self. Then try to lose yourself.\" They driest delivery this side of Gobi desert milk run also helped him sell surreal jokes such as \"I drew a gun. He drew a gun. I drew another gun. Soon we were surrounded by lovely drawings of guns.\" Most modern comedians worship at the altar of Murrays memory. Sanjeev KohliFor years Kohli, who as a youngster worked in his familyrsquos convenience stores, was the comic king of the cornershop, delivering us laugh after belly-laugh from behind a counter, as Navid Harrid, the grey-bearded shop-owner in Still Game, or as Ramesh Manju in award-winning, cult radio comedy Fags, Mags  Bags. Now a regular on River City, hersquos left the shop behind, playing banker-turned-baker AJ, and recently appeared in the biopic Stan And Ollie. Ivor CutlerIt was George Melly who maybe summed up the late Ivor Cutler best: ldquoVery funny in a sinister sort of way. The Scottish poet, songwriter and humourist grew up in a Jewish family in Govan, appeared in The Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour and was a favourite of John Peelrsquos. Proof that England doesnrsquot have a monopoly on eccentricity. Jerry SadowitzFew comedians dare take their stand-up to the places Sadowitz has been known to go, probably for good reason. The humour is as black as the trademark top hat, the material wince-inducingly controversial and the live shows chaotic and aggressive, meaning TV appearances have been rare . Despite this, the Glaswegian remains one of the most influential ndash and isive ndash stand-ups of the last  years. Bruce MortonBruce Morton did the best comedy show ever. March  at the MacBob in Stirling when he was touring Blood Below the Window, his autobiographical one-man show, which was hilar , but had a sucker punch of hurt at the heart of it. Apart from his dalliance with Channel  , Morton has always been too marginal a figure for his talent. But no one is better at hearing the comic music of the Scots tongue. Dorothy PaulThe undisputed Queen of Scottish comedy, the Dennistoun woman is as funny as she is loved by Glaswegians who love to be taken down memory lane to a world of jeely pieces and fumbles and the dancin. Paul convinced as an excellent actress in the likes of The Steamie, and more recently Still Game, but it was her live touring shows that revealed her glorious skills of holding an audience in the palm of her hand. Robert Florence and Iain ConnellThe duo behind sketch show Burnistoun brought us characters such as Jolly Boy John, Biscuity Boyle and Quality Polis, as well as co-writing the sitcom Legit which starred Clare Grogan, Jordan Young and Raymond Mearns. Florence will front topical satire series, The State of It, on the new BBC Scotland channel.Iain Connell: Work In Progress, Blackfriars Basement, March  and  Robert Florence is Biscuity Boyle: My Bastart Le - One Last Time!, Oran Mor, March  and  Ronni AnconaOne of the best impressionists of her generation, Ancona, who grew up in Troon, is also an accomplished stand-up and an impressive actor. But itrsquos her uncanny ability to capture everyone from Nigella Lawson to Audrey Hepburn, Victoria Beckham to Ruby Wax, Renee Zellweger to Jenner Saunders that continues to amuse. Scotland The WhatThe talented triumvirate of Buff Hardie, Stephen Robertson and George Donald ruled the North-eastin the s, s and early s with the now-neglected art of comedy revue. Dont miss the phone call to the Queen, inviting her to open Oldmeldrums sports day . Fern BradyFern Brady reached the finals of So You Think Youre Funny at the  Edinburgh Fringe and hasnt looked back since. The performer from Bathgate is bold, honest and at times startling ndash listen to her trashing of heterosexual marriages, or her take on Australias abortion laws ndash but never less than very funny. Whats not to like about a former journalist and stripper whos dryer than the inside of a sand lizardrsquos top lip and more blunt than the new Mary Poppins. Janet BrownThe Rutherglen-born actor and impressionist will always be best-known for her memorable impersonation of Margaret Thatcher at the height of her pomp, which cropped up throughout the s and s everywhere from Mike Yarwoodrsquos popular Saturday night show to Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Gerard KellyKelly, from Glasgow, was a panto favourite in the city and a talented serious actor, but his big break was as hapless bank worker and would-be author Willie Melvin in the BBC Scotland comedy City Lights. He was the lynchpin of a stellar cast . He died in  following a brain aneurysm. Jane McCarryShe steals the show as loveable busybody Isa Drennan on Still Game. As the hit BBC Scotland comedy bows out later this month, who wouldnrsquot love to see Isa and shopkeeper Navidget their own spin-off series  The campaign starts here. Robbie ColtraneColtranemade his name in the alternative comedy movement of the s before becoming a household name. He was brilliant as a criminal psychologist in Cracker he appeared in two Bond movies he was an outsize presence as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films. In the  C series National Treasure he was outstanding as Paul Finchley, an ageing comedian suddenly beset with allegations of historical rape and sexual assault. Richard WilsonIf you ever see Richard Wilson in the street, do not shout his catchphrase at him. In fact, donrsquot even think about the catchphrase. Yoursquore thinking about it now arenrsquot you  The thing is, Wilson was, and is, much more than catchphrase comedy. He once said that there was some of his dad in Victor Meldrew, star of One Foot in the Grave, and some of the writer David Renwick too, but the point is that, as he shakes his fist at idiocy, there is some of all of us in him. Arabella WeirShe coined the catchphrase \"Does my bum look big in this \" for The Fast Show, lit up our screens as long-suffering neighbour Beth in Two Doors Down and most recently had a star turn on comedy drama Pure as a mother whose OCD-suffering daughter is plagued by sexually explicit thoughts. Janey Godley and Ashley StorrieFrom Godleyrsquos ldquoTrump is a c*** sign held aloft as the US president visited his Ayrshire golf resort in  to Storriersquos hilarious parodies of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Handmaidrsquos Tale becoming viral hits, this mother and daughter are fearlessly chipping away at comedyrsquos glass ceiling. Godleyrsquos Nicola Sturgeon Theresa May Big Soup Pot skits are on the money.In Conversation with Janey Godley, City of Glasgow College, March  Janey Godley:  Years  Counting, Oran Mor,March - Ashley Storrie: Hysterical is at The Stand Comedy Club, March  and  Greg McHughThe Edinburgh born actor struck comedy gold when he dreamed up the character of Gary McLintoch, a soldier with a fictional Scottish regiment who delivers bon mots in broad Embra in much-loved mockumentary Gary: Tank Commander. McHugh also starred in Channel rsquos Fresh Meat, written by Peep Show creators Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. He has since moved on to straighter roles ndash hersquos currently in Channel  spy drama Traitors and Skyrsquos A Discovery Of Witches ndash but donrsquot think wersquove seen the last of Corporal McLintoch. Alan Cumming and Forbes MassonDrama school pals Cumming, from Aberfeldy, and Masson, from Falkirk, performed as musical double act and Kelvinside men Victor and Barry throughout the s and s, before finding success separately on stage and screen here and in the US. They briefly reunited in similar guise for the sarcastic, surreal cabin crew comedy The High Le alongside Siobhan Redmond. Stanley BaxterStanley Baxter once cleared the streets with his television specials that attracted m but the Glaswegian suffered all his le from anxiety and a need to be in control. As a result, Stanley, who lives in North London, offered up product sparingly, the world having the opportunity to see his Dietrich or his Coward only episodically. What he has created however is an incredible Bafta-winning legacy. LimmyIf you like your comedy surreal with a good dash of daft, Glaswegian Brian Limond has been the go-to purveyor for more than a decade. Arguably the first true UK comedian of the internet age, Limmy grew a loyal local online audience with his strangely loveable band of characters ndash who could forget former heroin addict Jacqueline McCafferty or frustrated adventure gameshow host Falconhoof  ndash but has found national recognition thanks to TV, live shows and two books.Limmy, Surprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny, Oran Mor, March , ,  and  Alastair SimYou have to be very serious to be good at comedy and Alastair Sim was very serious, particularly about his stage career. But itrsquos the films we love. Like A Christmas Carol. Is Simrsquos the greatest Scrooge  Probably. Or Laughter in Paradise in which hersquos a good man forced to go bad to inherit some moneyAnd The Belles of St Trinians of course in which he plays the headmistress Millicent Fritton. British comedy finds pretty much nothing funnier than a man in a dress but Alastair Sim did it best. Gregor Sharp and Simon CarlyleThe creators and writing partnership behind Two Doors Down which is hands-down one the funniest comedies to grace our TV screens in recent years with echoes of sitcom greats ndash from Abigails Party to The Royle Family ndash in its winning formula. More please. Gregor FisherThe ragtag Govan philosopher Rab C. Nesbitt was, as Fisher once noted, \"somebody who was forgotten, somebody from the so-called underbelly of society.\" Indeed he was, but Nesbitt managed to be one of the funniest comedy characters to emerge from Scotland, and one of the most poignant, too. He made us laugh but the laughs were sometimes uncomfortable ndash there were lots of acute social truths in them. Daniel SlossNetflix-approved and still not , Sloss has the armour-plated arrogance of youth. Sometimes that can come across as simply arrogance. But, as his latest show X, which tackles toxic masculinity, proves, he is ambitious for his comedy. He also has the stagecraft. In other words, hersquos good now, but how good is he going to be  years from now  Michelle GomezFrom unhinged staff liaison officer Sue White in Green Wing to murderous Missy in Doctor Who, Gomez brilliantly nails weirdly offbeat, deeply funny characters. The Glaswegian, also known for comic turns in The Book Group and Bad Education is currently appearing in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The KrankiesThe Krankies in the top  best Scottish comedians of all time  Are we mad-dabi-dozi  Not really: remember that Janette and Ian Tough were masters of three neglected areas of comedy: the club circuit, which is where they first made their mark in the s comedy for children on Crackerjack and the likeand pantomime, which the Krankies have dominated in Scotland for years. And no, wersquore not defending the single they released. It was not fan-dabi-dozi. No-one danced all night. And it was not all right. Rory BremnerHeonce fooled Margaret Beckett, then a minister in a Labour cabinet minister, into thinking she was talking on the phone to the Chancellor Gordon Brown. She wasnt, of course: it was the mischievous Bremner, who had Browns distinctive burr down to a T. The spoof was a reminder of his formidable impersonation skills and his gt for political satire. The hit Channel  show, Bremner, Bird and Fortune, is much missed. Rikki FultonNotmany comedians can make us laugh merely by saying lsquohellorsquo. Watch, on YouTube, any of Rikki Fultonrsquos turns as Rev I.M. Jolly on the Hogmanay Scotch and Wry shows, and you see just that: the lights going up, and Rikki, with an almost audible sigh, uttering that ineffably melancholy lsquohellorsquo. Fulton had been one-half of Francie and Josie, had starred in iety and panto, and was a serious actor, too. The Rev I.M. Jolly became a Hogmanay must-see for many Scots. Ashley JensenJensenwas fetchingly eccentric as Ricky Gervaiss best friend, Maggie, in the Gervais Stephen Merchant-penned TV hit, Extras. She has gone on to refine her comedic and acting gts in TV and in film, including Ugly Betty and Agatha Raisin. The good news is that she can be seen alongside Gervais again in After Le, Rickys latest dark comedy, in which he plays a man struggling after the death of his we. It starts on Netflix on March . Ford Kiernan and Greg HemphillThe co-creators, writers and stars of Still Game and Chewinrsquo The Fat have more than earned their place among the upper echelons of Scottish comedyrsquos hall of fame, gting the nation an enduring lexicon that includes ldquoTwo pints, p**** ldquoThatrsquos plenty! ldquoYoursquove taken that too far and ldquoTake a drink!. Ronnie CorbettBoth venerated and under-ratedEdinburgh-born Corbett came for the fore during the satire boom of the s. But it was in the s and s that his star truly ascended, courtesy of his double act with Ronnie Barker and the programme they fronted, The Two Ronnies. Notionally he was the straight guy, but only notionally as subsequent generations of comics knew full well: David Walliams, Matt Lucas, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were among those who sought him out in his later years. Frankie BoyleDark and pessimistic humour. Close to the bone jokes. Brutal analogies. Boyle stokes controversy with his no-holds-barred subject matter. A rare family-newspaper-friendly sample: ldquoLas Vegas and Glasgow have a lot in common: theyrsquore the only two places in the world where you can pay for sex with chips. Kevin BridgesImpish, irreverent, clever, the natural successor to Connolly on the comedy stage ndashhe has the desire to keep going. Bridges manages to take seemingly ordinary le experience and turn it into something far less than ordinary. And he clearly has a head for political satire. \"Working in Poundstretcher for no wageshellipworking in a shop where everything is worth a quid except you. Elaine C SmithA bona fide national treasure, Elaine C Smithrsquos career to date has encompassed not just comedy but also singing, straight acting , journalism, political campaigning, even teaching, all delivered with the aplomb and brio of a natural raconteur who excels at everything she turns her hand to.Typically, however, she has a more self-effacing take on the motives behind her genre-defying years in the spotlight. The idea, she once said, is to ldquojust keep moving ndash yoursquoll be less of a target. Seriously, though, nobody is likely to be taking aim at the star, who turned  last year: the charisma oozing from her when shersquos in character is unforced, and off-stage shersquos as warm, personable, generous and defiantly un-starry as you would expecther to be.Smithrsquos list of achievements and associations runs the gamut from Ato, wellnot Z than at least as far as W, standing for Wildcat Theatre. Smith first encountered its politically-inspired progenitor, :, at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow as an -year-old and, suitably inspired, performed regularly with Wildcat throughout the s, including in the original production of The Steamie. Among her other credits in serious acting roles are BBC One drama Two Thousand Acres Of Sky and Kay Mellorrsquos hit series The Syndicate.But itrsquos for her contribution to comedy that shersquos best known and in particular for the role filed under M: Mary Nesbitt, aka Mary Doll, aka the long-suffering spouse to Govan nersquoer-do-well Rab C Nesbitt, he of string vest and filthy gutties fame.Smith clocked up her first of many Rab C episodes when the show debuted with a one-off pilot episode in late , and she was still there in  for the New Yearrsquos Day Special which found Rab fighting the bedroom tax. As an integral part of the much loved and award-winning show, shersquos now firmly embedded in Scotlandrsquos cultural DNA.Nobody will ever hail Mary as a role model for Scottish women or a worthwhile advert for hands-off parenting, but as an iconic comic character therersquos no touching her, and itrsquos hard to see who  in the Scottish acting firmament could have done her justice.Away from the dysal world of the Nesbitt family Smithrsquos comic skills have been put to good use in pantomimeand in less nihilistic TV sitcoms such as City Lights, in which she starred alongside the great Gerard Kelly, and in current hit Two Doors Down .Importantly, Smith also developed her own one-woman show, first mounting it in the mid-s and blazing an inspiring trail for a generation of younger Scottish actresses and comics to follow. And follow they have, another reason Elaine C Smith sits so high on our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.An Audience with Elaine C Smith, Kings Theatre, March  Armando IannucciIn an era when fake news is both a reality and a slur to be flung at reputable media organisations by emotionally incontinent politicians, it often feels ascurrent affairs and the reporting off them have moved way beyond satire. Which may explain why Glasgow-born writer, producer, director and arch-satirist Armando Iannucci is heading into space for his next project ndash Avenue , a sci-fi comedy for HBO starring Hugh Laurie.Butthe next chapter in the Scotrsquos comic journey takes place off-planet he leaves behind a treasure trove of earth-bound gems and itrsquos on account of that three decade back catalogue that he ranks so highly in our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.Cerebral and opinionated, with a liking for the scabrous and possessed of the outsiderrsquos eye which is vital for satire, Iannucci cut his teeth at BBC Radio Scotland in the late s on the likes of Norsquo The Archie McPherson Show. But those same gnashers first left their mark on the wider cultural landscape when he co-created Steve Cooganrsquos Alan Partridge character for BBC Radio rsquos On The Hour in . In  Iannucci and On The Hour co-star Chris Morris took the show to television as news parody The Day Today but Coogan and Iannucci would continue the Partridge association across three more series following the inimitable Alan, surely one of British comedyrsquos greatest creations, from the highs of television stardom to the lows of a static caravan and a berth on Radio Norfolk.In , Channel  gave Iannucci his own self-titled show. Inexplicably, it ran for only one season but had it not then we may have missed out on the show that came next ndash The Thick Of It, a fly-on-the-wall style mockumentary which debuted in  and burrowed its way into the heart of the New Labour machine where it dispensed satirical headbutts to one and all. Many, though not all, of these were delivered by another inspired Iannucci creation, spin doctor and full-time sociopath Malcolm Tucker. He was played in the show by Peter Capaldi, another Glaswegian of Italian descent whose family were actually near-neighbours of the Iannuccis in Springburn.Of course with so much of the UKrsquos political and media landscape being influenced and affected by the United States, the endlessly ambitious Iannucci was never going to limit himself to these shores. In , he adapted The Thick Of It for cinema and dropped hapless British government minister Tom Hollander into Washingtonrsquos then un-drained political swamp where he was pitted against boorish American general James Gandolfini. The film was called In The Loop and it won Iannucci an Oscar nomination.Three years later he created Veep for HBO. Starring former Seinfeld stalwart Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the US Vice President it took the TTOI format and tweaked it to create a hilarious political comedy which did for le in the West Wing what TTOI had done for the fictitious Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship . Veep is now in its seventh and final season and the previous six were all nominated for Emmy Awards. To date it was won , including Outstanding Comedy Series for the last three years running.So, itrsquos space next for Armando Iannucci, a place where no-one can hear you scream . Butthe Scot remains true to form, donrsquot think you wonrsquot be doing exactly that. Billy ConnollyWHAT makes Billy Connolly not only the greatest comedian in the UK, but the world  Wersquove long attached superlatives to his name, long tried to wonder what makes the Glaswegian so funny. There are those who cite Sir Billyrsquos surrealist streak and highlight how the former shipyard worker was influenced by the great Chic Murray.But what is it about Connolly thatrsquos allowed him to become a global superstar, a comedian, actor, documentary film maker and half decent banjo player  What defines him INSECURITY: All the great comedians are blessed with tragic insecurity and Connolly is no exception. It instils constant searching, an analysis of the world around which they keep trying to make sense of, in the hope that along the way it can provide comedy gold. ldquoI think my securities far outweigh my insecurities, he said. ldquoI am not nearly as afraid of myself and my imagination as I used to be.But that wasnrsquot always the case at all. Recalling the seven year-old schoolboy who fell in a puddle and was laughed at, Connolly realised that being mocked was far better than being beaten by nuns, or the Aunt who looked after him, or his father who sexually abused him. He knew then that escape from perpetual misery involved making people laugh and actually enjoyed his puddle moment. But he also knewhe were to become a comedian he would have to cultivate a personality, to ldquomake myself look windswept and interesting.It took time however. The quest involved the teenager experimenting with several worlds, from libraries to the Scouts, to cycling clubs to a religious group with whom he would travel to houses and read the Rosary to those ldquowaiting to watch the Beverly Hillbillies.CAMPERY: Even during his years in the shipyards, Connolly was never reluctant to draw attention to himself, with outrageous footwear and outfits so far away from the regulation Burton The Tailor two-piece. Later on, this inveterate show-offrsquos stage outfits were never quite a threat to Elton,but he came close. No opportunity was ever missed to surprise, whether appearing in lurex, banana boots or deck chair jackets. The result provided a delicious incongruity the insecure clown on stage telling jokes about his grim childhood, yet doing so with a continuous flick of highlighted hair, or a swish of the silky poncho.HAIR: Connolly certainly put his hair to good use. He has always had a very good head of it, which allowed him to leave the shipyard aged . Anyone with less hair would never have dared to enter the milieu that was the Scottish folk scene in the Sixties. The folk scene was really a front however for his true intent to follow Jimmy Logan and Stanley Baxter onto the entertainment circuit, and make the world laugh. But the hair suggested dferent characters he could be the urban philosopher, he could be a hippie, before later taking on a grander power and nailing his audience with the Crucixion.AWARENESS OF REALITY: Connolly was shaped, moulded, battered and plated by the experience of working as a boilerman in the shipyards, from the ages of -. Yet, while that provided reams of raw material for a comedy act, Connolly hadnrsquot yet worked up the courage to make the leap. Indeed, it took a colleague in the yards who told him to leave and never come back, to see him go off and pursue the dream.Connolly, however, was clever enough to know he wasnrsquot ready to go it alone and for a while held the hands of Humblebumsrsquo musicians Tam Harvey and Gerry Rafferty. And he was aware, that when matched with Rafferty, he was out of his depth. ldquoIrsquove got a voice like a goose farting in a tunnel, he admitted. ldquoAnd Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge.BOLDNESS: Comedy, not folk music, was the future and success grew in Scotland with the release of his live albums. In , a taxi driver told Michael Parkinson how good the Big Yin was and he landed an invite. But how many comedians when offered the chance to appear on the biggest chat show in the land would tell a joke about we-murdering, sexual depravity and cheeky bicycle-parking  Connollyrsquos manager Frank Lynch figured this career was over before it really began. Wrong, Frank. So wrong.REFUSAL TO BE CONSTRAINED: If Billy Connolly once had to battle with an inferiority complex, being told he was useless by the aunt he lived with, he did a very good job of hiding it as his career rolled on. If anyone every bothered to tell him he could never become a playwright, he certainly didnrsquot listen.If anyone mentioned he couldnrsquot become a pop star, that too fell on deaf ears and he appeared on Top of The Pops several times with pastiches of Tammy Wynettersquos DIVORCE and the Village Peoplersquos In The Navy. .What was also apparent was Connolly wasnrsquot afraid to cause political upset, to create ide, at one time describing the newly devolved Scottish government as ldquoa pretendy wee parliament. The man who at one time owned homes in Aberdeenshire, New York and Malta, believed himself to be a citizen of the world. And somehow he got away with his critiques because, well, he was above it all.SOCIAL CHAMELEONISM: Connolly has been able to adapt to and fit in to a iety of worlds. His film career brought him into the orbit of the showbiz greats, the likes of Robin Williams and the Pythons, but far from feeling out of his depth, the Scot not only thrived but fed on his new source material. He discovered being Glaswegian could be a bonus. He made Glaswegians, for the first time, believe something very positive could come out of a housing scheme.WRITING: But itrsquos his comic writing that confirms the manrsquos genius. Aged , he moved to the Glasgow housing scheme, Drumchapel. He said later, ldquoDrumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, itrsquos in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation. His similes are close to perfect. After appearing on the same bill as Elton John in the States in , the Scot was hit on the head with a pipe. ldquoThey made me feel as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit, he said later.HErsquoS A VARIETY ARTIST: While Connolly could come up with Chic Murray like aphorisms ndash ldquoMarriage is a great invention ndash but then so is the bicycle repair kit, or brilliant parodies such as the Crucixion, he has never been afraid to bend towards the Bernard Manning ldquoIf women are so bloody perfect at multi-tasking, how come they canrsquot have a headache and sex at the same time. Or how about: ldquoA biker goes to the doctor with hearing problems. lsquoCan you describe the symptoms to me rsquo lsquoYes. Homer is a fat yellow lazy b****** and Marge is a skinny bird with big blue hair!AND A PSYCHOLOGIST: Connolly offers big performance. No Rich Hall -side-of-mouth-jokes. He doesnrsquot just tell you a funny story. He throws it right onto your face. But he also understands and highlights the fragilities and complexities of the human condition, revealed with his line, \"Never trust a man, who when left alone with a tea cosey doesnt try it on.\" Even his throwaway comments ldquoBigotry is a hobby in Glasgow canrsquot fail to resonate.SELF-DEPRECATION: He can be in your face and seemingly confident but knows his limits and when to rein it in. Connolly, for example, points out he is usually killed off in the first  minutes of his movies. But he can act as he revealed in Queen Victoria biopic Mrs Brown, a perfect vehicle for his ability to switch from aggression to tenderness in the flick of an eyelid. But itrsquos also hard to see past his deliciously quixotic role in  dark comedy What We Did On Our Holiday.HErsquoS A SALESMAN: Connolly has sold Glasgow to the world. Okay, it wasnrsquot a shortbread tin version of his hometown, more a rusty Spam tin, with bits of stale meat still inside, but he never, ever failed to make it funny. Where Joycersquos Ulysses transformed the image of Dublin from a backwater to a metropolis, Connolly too has sold his hometown, its colour and vibrancy, its humour as dark as a boilermakerrsquos overalls.HErsquoS A FIGHTER: Billy Connolly offers up the black comedy line, ldquoIrsquove got Parkinsonrsquos Disease. And I wish tae f*** hersquod take it back. But at the same time Sir Billy is entirely aware of the impact hersquos had on so many people. And so he should be. \"Im very lucky in as much as I made a bit of a mark, and you think, well, I must have done something right.The Glasgow International Comedy Festival runs from March -.

He wants to pitch himself as a potential First Minister and present his party as a united family to voters.Gary Smith, who leads a trade union that employed Leonard for more than  years, appears not to have been sent the harmony memo.According to Smith, Scottish Labour has failed on Brexit and been weak on anti-Semitism. Damningly, he says Leonardrsquos strategy of ldquoriding on the coat-tails of Jeremy Corbyn wonrsquot work. In boxing terms, Smith has delivered a first-round knock-out.His analysis also happens to be shared by a growing body of opinion within Scottish Labour. I accept Leonard and Corbyn are close politically, but ideological similarities do not require a leader to surrender his autonomy and behave like a parrot.Brexit is his biggest failure. Leonard, much to the frustration of his MSPs and party members, has echoed Corbynrsquos Euroscepticism and opted to say as little as he can get away with on a second referendum. Both men want to strangle this option.Leonardrsquos hostility to a public vote is against the backdrop of over % of voters in Scotland supporting Remain in . Opinion polls show that backing for staying in the European Union has grown since the referendum. And yet, despite these facts, Leonard has bizarrely manoeuvred himself into the position of being the most pro-Brexit leader at Holyrood.His sleepy approach to the anti-Semitism row provides further evidence that his gut instinct is to defer to Corbyn. When the UK Labour leader resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism last year, Leonardrsquos response should have been swt and decisive.ldquoThe party should sign up to the IHRA and all the associated examples, without hesitation. We must make amends with the Jewish community, the statement should have read.Leonard instead gave a feeble interview to the BBC during which he offered warm words to Jews, but nothing . Corbyn eventually performed a U-turn and, asby magic, so did Leonard. It is clear some of his supporters believe the anti-Semitism scandal has been exaggerated to damage the Corbyn project.As a result of his back-seat leadership, Leonardrsquos fortunes are now tied to the electoral performance of Corbyn. He has failed to exercise the autonomy many of his predecessors worked so hard to extract from the UK party. His team is effectively a satellite of the Leader of the Oppositionrsquos Office at Westminster.He may also regret trying to use Corbyn as his meal ticket to Bute House, as there is little evidence of a ldquoJC bounce in Scotland. As Smith pointed out, although Scottish Labour made gains at the last general election, the party only put on , votes compared with the previous poll. Around , of these were in Edinburgh South, where Ian Murray was explicitly anti-Corbyn.Two rows are brewing that will inevitably fuel Labour faction-fighting. On Holyrood selections, Leonard allies want him to use his majority on the partyrsquos Executive to hand-pick List candidates for next Scottish Parliament election. Such a move would be brutal, and could inject fresh blood into a jaded group of MSPs, but it would backfireit was used to install middle aged under-achievers from the trade union movement.The partyrsquos ldquoorganisational review, led by deputy leader Lesley Laird, is the other potential flashpoint. Scottish Labour Kremlinologists see it as an attempt to restrict the power of general secretary Brian Roy and his team. Insiders say UK Labour is already micro-managing Scottish Labour finances in an unprecedented way.Leonard is a nice man. He has a big heart and was a more authentic representative of Labour values than Anas Sarwar, who he defeated for the leadership. But he is flailing and his party is heading towards another thumping defeat. Scottish Labour needs a leader, not a follower."},{"url":null,"title":"the-seuss-the-whole-seuss-and-nothing-but-the-seuss","story":"IF you look back on your le yoursquoll be surprised to discover just how deeply Ted Geisel is embedded in the heart and soul of your family. For me, it started with my grandmother teaching me to read at the local library the summer before I went to primary school. She chose books by Geisel - beloved around the world under his pen name, Dr Seuss. Green Eggs and Ham, and The Cat in the Hat set me up for a lelong love affair with the written word.I taught my own children to read with Dr Seuss, and to this day my two daughters and I still read The Grinch together every Christmas Eve. Theyrsquore  and . They tell me theyrsquoll read the same books to their children, and I imagine in years to come those children reading Seuss to their own sons and daughters long after Irsquom gone.After I published my first novel, I began writing stories for my children, but I soon realised Irsquod never have the magic of Seuss - whorsquos been called the Milton, the Renoir, of childrenrsquos writing. So I began studying the le of Ted Geisel - I wanted to know what shaped this genius.Itrsquos a good time to tell his story: yesterday was Dr Seuss Day, when hersquos celebrated around the world, and Thursday is World Book Day - an excuse for children to dress up as their favourite literary characters. Unsurprisingly, the Cat in the Hat is one of the most ubiquitous outfits.Ted was a complex man, his soul could be as light as a childrsquos, yet his le - which charted the th century and took in many of its great themes such as war, wealth, race and changing social values - was often full of the pain of adulthood.He was born into a wealthy immigrant German family in the town of Springfield, Massachusetts, in , and named Theodore Seuss Geisel. Itrsquos thought Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, set his anarchic cartoon in a fictional Springfield in homage to Seuss. From the very beginning, Tedrsquos le was a mix of word-play and imagination. The brewery his father owned - Kalmbach and Geisel - was known locally as lsquoCome Back and Guzzlersquo, and his mother, from a family of bakers, sang weird nonsense songs to him about pies.His father helped run the local zoo, and encouraged Ted to draw the animals he saw there. Tedrsquos pictures were strange caricatures - with too many knuckles, or spindly legs. His first character came from one of these lsquozoo drawingsrsquo - a beast with ears nine foot long which he called a lsquowynnmphrsquo.His niece Peggy Owens - who was as close to Seuss as a daughter - said: lsquoHe never lost the ability to see things through the eyes of a child.rsquo That ability to retreat into a world of imagination became more important to Ted as he got older. When the First World War broke out, Ted found himself bullied by other children because of his German roots and with the coming of prohibition in peace time, the family brewery was closed.Ted was no great scholar but he excelled at English, and after school he went on to Dartmouth College. While there, he spent most of his time writing for the collegersquos magazine Jack-O-Lantern - which carried cartoons and comic stories. Classes forgotten, hersquod be found in the morning, sleeping at his editorial desk. His niece Peggy said: lsquoHe simply never stopped playing hookey from the real world.rsquoA run-in with the law over a gin party during prohibition saw him banned from the magazine. But Ted got round the punishment by writing under a nom de plume: Seuss. Phyllis Cerf Wagner - the actress, socialite and writer who married Tedrsquos publisher Bennet Cerf, and was instrumental in the shaping of the Seuss legend - said: lsquoHe took his motherrsquos maiden name, Seuss, as he was saving Geisel for when he wrote the great American novel.rsquoFor now, though, the dizzying heights of literature were to evade him. He went to Oxford University in the hope of becoming an English professor, but dropped out. He spent most of his time at Oxford doodling in his notebook - which brought him to the attention of a bright young American woman called Helen Palmer. Looking over his shoulder in a lecture, she saw one of his pictures - a flying cow - and told him he should become an illustrator. Not long after, they ed to America and married. Helen was less a muse and more a mentor - she encouraged and helped shape his work, and she brought order to his le.Ted was no party animal - he was shy, nervous in public, and liked the company of close friends not big groups, though he did love a vodka on the rocks and plenty of cigarettes - however, the strictures of adulthood were not for him. Without Helen, it was said, he wouldnrsquot have been able to balance a chequebook.Ted became a jobbing cartoonist and by now had added lsquoDrrsquo to his pen-name - an in-joke about the doctorate hersquod failed to get at Oxford. His big break came by chance. In the s, Flit was a popular brand of fly-spray. Ted drew a one-off cartoon for Judge magazine showing a medieval knight who canrsquot sleep because therersquos a dragon in his bedroom. The punch line reads: lsquoDarn it all, another dragon. And just after I sprayed the whole castle with Flit.rsquoHe was hired on the spot to do all Flitrsquos ads. lsquoThis became one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history,rsquo one of his biographers, Janet Pascal, says. Financially comfortable, Ted now turned his attention towards his lelong ambition: writing and illustrating childrenrsquos books.Ted was infamous in his family for exaggeration - he was always embellishing the truth . His first big success was more than a little autobiographical. The book lsquoAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Streetrsquotells the story of a child out for a walk who imagines a fantastical adventure. A suburban afternoon becomes filled with make-believe giraffes, magicians, police - and a man with a ten foot beard.Initially, publishers turned the book down - it didnrsquot have a moral, they said - but finally it was bought and in  became a critical hit. Beatrix Potter was a fan, saying she adored lsquothe truthful simplicity of the untruthfulnessrsquo.Publicly, Tedrsquos le was on the up, but privately there was much sadness. His mother died before seeing his success, and his beloved sister Marnie drted into alcoholism and died whilst estranged from Ted. He and his we also learned they couldnrsquot have children. Ted would later invent an imaginary child lsquoChrysanthemum-Pearlrsquo and heartbreakingly dedicate a book to her. His friend and biographer Judith Morgan said: lsquoPart of his protection was to not allow himself to spend his le in grief, and perhaps thatrsquos why he found such joy in doing the outrageous books he did.rsquoHis next successful book, Horton Hatches The Egg, added the morality that Mulberry Street was seen to lack. It tells the story of an elephant, Horton, who finds an egg, abandoned by its mother, and sits on it in the hope of hatching it, in the face of threats and even the risk of being shot. lsquoShootyou must,rsquo says Horton, lsquoI wonrsquot run away. I meant what I said and I said what I meant, an elephant is faithful,  per cent.rsquoIt was a smash hit. Tedrsquos editor, Michael Frith, said: lsquoIn the hands of a gted preacher therersquos nothing more powerful than a great lesson.rsquoHorton appeared in . As war loomed, it would be seven years before Ted wrote another book. lsquoWhile Paris was being occupied by the clanking tanks of the Nazis,rsquo Ted said, lsquoI could no longer keep my mind on drawing pictures of Horton the elephant.rsquoToo old to fight, Ted enlisted and became a captain in one of the most remarkable propaganda outfits ever - the US armyrsquos First Motion Picture Unit. He worked with Mel Blanc , Chuck Jones , and Frank Caprachurning out films like Private Snafu - army slang for lsquoSituation Normal: All F****d Uprsquo - to boost the war effort.After the war, there was a social panic over the effect of TV on childrenrsquos literacy. Ted was challenged by his publisher to write a story for children learning to read using just  simple words. The limitations were tortuous but after a yearrsquos labour The Cat in the Hat was born - the story of a trickster cat who causes havoc in the lives of two young children.The book has been poured over by literary scholars. Itrsquos been subjected to Freudian analysisand to racial interpretations . To most, it simply captures the anarchy of childhood. Janet Schulman, an editor who worked closely with Ted, said: lsquoHe allowed a childrsquos imagination to guide him.rsquoTed was now re-writing the rules of how children learned to read. With Green Eggs and Ham, he reduced the number of words in the book to just  - making it a perfect primer - and was hailed as the saviour of childrenrsquos literacy, replacing stale Peter and Jane with the crazy Fox in Socks.Now the most important childrenrsquos author in the world, Tedrsquos stories became more political. The Sneetches savages American racism The Butter Battle Book mocks the Cold War The Lorax is an environmentalist fable. His politics often upset conservative America.In , after struggling with ill health, and depression over Tedrsquos affair with Audrey Stone Dimond, a friend of the family, Helen took her own le. Ted married Audrey less than a year later.Tedrsquos last book is one of his most loved - Oh, the Places Yoursquoll Go. Itrsquos Tedrsquos joyous take on le - his valediction to readers young and old. His agent, Jed Mattes, said it was lsquolike a wise grandfather sitting down and talking to a younger generationrsquo.In his last days, Ted, too unwell to make it to his bedroom, slept in his studio. He died in , just a few feet from his drawing board. After his death, the students of his old college, Dartmouth, recited his works for a full day, as a mark of respect to a man who had single-handedly shaped their childhood, and the collective childhood of us all."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  28 days to go and Westminster won   t even reject no deal  let alone back a People   s Vote","story":"I could give you a pious expression of naive hope.

Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-28-days-to-go-and-westminster-wont-even-reject-no-deal-let-alone-back-a-peoples-vote","story":"I could give you a pious expression of naive hope.

It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"settlement-was-offered-three-years-earlier-to-glasgow-city-council","story":"Stefan Cross of Action  Equality Scotland, which represents the majority of the , mainly female workers who secured the mammoth settlement in January, said he approached the council in June  with the intention of bringing an end to the long-running dispute.ldquoWe had a short meeting with [then council leader] Frank McAveety and [HR director] Robert Anderson to discuss the possibility of resolving these matters, he said.ldquoThe basis was thatthey paid our clients what we thought they were entitled to under payment protection we would end the legal proceedings.ldquoOur estimate was that it would be about pound million but we would have to very the figures as we hadnrsquot seen the pay data.ldquoThat was the nature of the discussion it was us making a presentation trying to break the log-jam and them not responding at all. We didnrsquot succeed - thank god for that.At that time, the council had won an employment tribunal case saying that a job evaluation process it had completed a decade previously was sound. An appeals tribunal, however, had ruled that its practice of protecting bonuses that had previously been earned by male staff only was discriminatory.While the women were appealing the first decision and the council the second, Mr Cross said he would have been willing to draw a line under all proceedings to settle the payment protection part only.ldquoStatistically, therersquos only a % chance of overturning a tribunal decision so we knew there was a massive risk that we would lose the appeal - it was much more likely that we would lose than we would win, he said.ldquoWe thought we wouldnrsquot win until we got to the Supreme Court, although we didnrsquot even knowwe would get the possibility to get to the Supreme Court.ldquoWe didnrsquot know we would win at the Court of Session - that was the risk we were running - but it happened to be that we got a bench that clicked.After losing both appeals the council, which passed from Labour to minority SNP control in May , agreed to settle the claims, with the poundm deal being agreed this January after a year of negotiations. To help foot the bill the local authority, which will increase council tax by % this year, is mortgaging a portfolio of properties including the Riverside Museum and SEC Armadillo, with the annual cost of servicing that debt expected to run into tens of millions of pounds.Mr McAveety and Glasgow City Council both confirmed that the informal and unminuted meeting with Action  Equality took place, although they denied that the poundm figure had been discussed.ldquoThis did not happen, a council spokesman said. ldquoRepresentatives of ActionEquality restated their position that the council should stop defending equal-pay claims.ldquoHowever, officers are clear that no offer was made and that figure was not put to the council.Mr McAveety said that while he personally would have been in favour of negotiating an end to the dispute, his hands were tied by council officials who wanted to follow legal process.ldquoSenior officials said lsquothis is in the courts and therersquos been an employment tribunal ruling that has favoured the councilrsquo, he said.ldquoThe general discussion [at the meeting] was around the issue of the number of folk that Action  Equality were representing, an observation on the role of the trade unions and, from Stefan Crossrsquos point of view, that we should try to settle.ldquoIt was left to Robert Anderson and the chief executive [Annemarie OrsquoDonnell] to deal with and I never came back [to Action  Equality] because I thought there was no authorisation from the council.The eventual bill for the local authority is signicantly higher than Mr Crossrsquos original estimate because, in addition to the number of claimants more than doubling since June , it is compensating affected workers for having their jobs undervalued as well as for not being able to share in bonuses.The poundm figure covers the period from , when the discredited pay system was put in place, to either  or , with a further settlement expected to be negotiated to cover the period from that end point to when a new system is put in place.The new scheme is not expected to be implemented until  at the earliest, with , inidual jobs having to be assessed, compared and signed off by both the council and the womenrsquos union representatives first.The staff who are part of the claim are expected to start receiving their cash in the summer, with average payments in the region of pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-documentary-george-osborne-wanted-westminster-to-run-indyref","story":"The controversial idea was considered, but rejected, after Liberal Democrat Ministers insisted the rules of the plebiscite should be set north of the border.The programme also revealed that former prime minister Gordon Brown wanted half of the money raised by the No side to go to Labourrsquos standalone campaign.The first episode of a three-part documentary - Yes No ndash Inside The Indyref - will look at the events which led to the announcement of the independence vote, the role of social media, and how the teams developed their strategies.It contains exclusive interviews with the key players during the referendum, and was made by Paul Mitchell, who was behind Inside Obamarsquos White House and The Death of Yugoslavia.The first episode includes the reaction amongst senior Westminster figures to the SNPrsquos landslide victory at the  Holyrood election, which paved the way for a referendum.However, in a  meeting of the ldquoquad - the key figures in the Tory LibDem coalition at Westminster - there was a discussion on London making the key decision.Nick Clegg, who at that point was the deputy prime minister, said: ldquoI remember at that meeting, George Osborne arrived late, and said half-seriously, half-jokingly, lsquocanrsquot we just run the referendum from London  Thatrsquos what they would do in Spainrsquo.Michael Moore, the then Scotland Secretary and Lib Dem MP, told the programme: ldquoHowever he meant it, it was considered.

Ham is currently hogging American headlines due to an ongoing dispute with atheist pressure group the Freedom From Religion Foundation ndash who believe Ham is a bit of a swine. The FFRF promotes the separation of church and government ndash a rather bold endeavour in a state where Governor Matt Bevin recently declared ldquoThe Year of the Bible. Perhaps, understandably, FFRF mostly carry out their protests by way of the internet ndash you canrsquot shoot the head off an online petition, after all.The group is furious that pound million in state tax incentives have helped fund Hamrsquos creationist theme park, yet ndash to be fair ndash some state officials did try to stop these generous tax breaks after learning the hardcore creationist entrepreneur would only hire Christians. Fuelled by the stimulant of self-righteous indignation, however, Ham decided to sue the state in federal court ndash and brought home the bacon by winning his case. Impressed Kentucky politicians then saw fit to reward his indefatigable faith with another wee rebate check for . million. Praise the Lord, indeed.With the penny finally dropping that there may perhaps be some sympathetic fundamentalist mindsets on governmental boards, FFRF has now recalibrated its aim and taken direct action ndash sending letters to more than , public schools around Kentucky to highlight the mind-warping dangers of taking advantage of Hamrsquos offer of free class field trips to Ark Encounter.Certainly, the statue of a smiling diplodocus at the entrance is indicative of a wilfully ignorant and wildly subjective interpretation of the Earthrsquos four-and-a-half billion year history. Yet, where traditional theme parks such as Blackpool Pleasure Beach ultimately confirm there is no God, Ark Encounter solely exists to solidy belief in a ine creator and His miraculous six-day endeavour.A gay old timeARK Encounterrsquos piegravece de reacutesistance is, like it says on the tin, an ldquoaccurate -feet-long recreation of Noahrsquos Ark ndash complete with animatronic models of dinosaurs and humans living together in harmony, just like in The Flintstones. And Job :ndash,creationist Biblical interpretations of the word ldquobehemoth are to be believed.Yet, in a move not quite in the spirit of Christrsquos New Testament message of acceptance and love, all employees at the park are required to sign a ldquostatement of faith which explicitly prohibits them from employmenttheyrsquore ldquogay, bi, or a person who has attempted to alter gender by surgery or appearance.Itrsquos perhaps then no surprise that Ham also has a concurrent campaign to, ahem, ldquotake back the rainbow. Which was,we recall Sunday School storytime, first gted to the Earth by temperamental Old Testament tyrant Yahweh himself ndash in a plea for forgiveness after killing everyone in a pique of petulant fury at our so-called ldquosins, such as homosexuality and the like. Itrsquos certainly ironic that despite being heavily influenced by The Flintstones, Ham certainly wonrsquot ever tolerate a ldquogay old time.Jockrsquos on usSCOTS are, of course, children of the Enlightenment, sensibly secular of mind and progressively liberal enough to have earned a wee condescending chuckle at the backward beliefs of some of our American cousins.Despite all evidence to the contrary, however, many of us remain within the confines of this self-gratying bubble of ldquowharsquos like us  nonsense. The truth is, wersquore perhaps even more societally regressive than any dusty, confederate backwater in the American heartlands.In , MSP Alasdair Allan ndash who was the Minister for Learning, Science and Scotlandrsquos Languages ndash saw fit to officially respond to pressure from the militantly atheist Scottish Secular Society , boldly stating the obvious to his peers in Holyrood: ldquoGuidance provided by Education Scotland does not identy Creationism as a scientic principle. It should therefore not be taught as part of science lessons.And neither should enriching uranium yet no-onersquos banned that yet. So, perhaps with that in mind, Allan fell short of outlawing the teaching of a six-day creation period by a prankster transdimensional magician ndash adding a rather timorous postscript that any precedents of governmental intolerance would inevitably lead to ldquocalls for bans on other issues and the curriculum would risk becoming mired in legal arrangements.One wonders whether Allanrsquos a**e is still numb from such an awkward perch on the fence. His non-committal stance does, however, echo successive Scottish and UK governmentsrsquo deeply ingrained reluctance to condemn, or even recognise, the bleeding chasm of ision for which religious dogma is almost entirely responsible. Most folk free from the micro-management of thought caused by this ancient virus can clearly see its butterfly effect of societal paralysis, and on a micro scale, calcying the neurones of its host to protect itself against rival contagions ndash or any wildly idealistic notions of utopic unity and global harmony.That the sediment of fear and superstition remains the fundamental layer we build our communities and education system upon in  is bad enough, but the fact religionrsquos stagnated stench still clogs the corridors of power is surely the ultimate absurdity ndash with Scottish local authorities still being legally obliged to cower under the overriding authority of Tha Lawd on council education boards.Return of the JediITrsquoS a law that surely proves wersquore all either numbed within a collective hypnotic state or that reality truly is a simulation run by malevolent aliens ndash the absurd ruling that Scottish councils are still legally required to appoint three education committee members to represent a transdimensional creator skyspirit. Legally, all require one Catholic representative, one Church of Scotland and one ldquoother. Perhaps a Jedi would be appropriate ndash as therersquos more chance of a Darth Vader figure existing in an infinite universe than a temperamental creator with suspiciously human traits such as jealousy, fury and regret.Yet, despite the comedic costumes being a dead giveaway to their shoogly grasp on reality, the pious are somehow bestowed with entirely unearned respect and privilege in our society, particularly within the corridors of power ndash despite their myopic belief systems infecting every warped thought and utterance.Itrsquos surely right that we question why unelected purveyors of fancul fiction can operate freely from voter accountably and bear influence on how our children are educated. South Lanarkshire Councilrsquos Dr Nagy Iskander is one such presence ndash a creationist who has said that evolution is ldquoreally illogical.Incidentally, Iskander counts Ark Encounterrsquos Ken Ham as a personal friend ndash perhaps admiring how he has earned a very comfortable living by convincing the naive and desperate that his self-serving porkies are the gospel truth.And finally ...PERHAPS there really is no need to rush any official ban on teaching creationism in Scottish classrooms.It could be argued itrsquos putting the cart before the horse in a country where we still appoint believers in ancient Abrahamic superstitions to education boards ndash and continue to segregate children in accordance to parental allegiances to a supernatural entity who only ever existed in our speciesrsquo minds.At least our Kentuckian cousins donrsquot believe their omnipotent comfort blanket has any allegiance to a particular sports team. Just last week, ldquoProtestant ldquoCatholic and ldquowest of Scotland were among the highest trending terms on UK twitter.Perhaps The Flintstones has simply evolved into a social media reality show, starring yabba dabba you and me.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

Any interruption to supply raises serious concern and may result in avoidable deaths.“There are many other drugs and medical supplies which are equally critical to health.“We are urgently calling on the Scottish Government to produce the detail required to reassure the Scottish public that all relevant organisations involved in the supply, storage and local distribution of medicines in Scotland, have robust systems and agreements in place.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So does Nicola Sturgeon’s comment about the possibility of forming a coalition government with Labouranother snap election’s called at Westminster. Askedshe might form a Labour-SNP coalition, Nicola Sturgeon said last week she was “ready to work with other parties” to oppose the Conservatives’ disastrous Brexit plans. The Conservatives also seem to be upping the ante. Last week an anonymous government minister warned “there’ll be no escaping the Brexit disaster for Scots”. He or she was apparently just one among “a number of senior figures” briefing the BBC against the prospect of another indyref. Methinks they doth protest too much. Meanwhile there are suggestions that the Scottish Tories have urged the Prime Minister to “keep hold of all the cards” in the event of a second referendum so that London decides the date, question and franchise – a clear acknowledgment that allowing under-s and non-European citizens to vote again would be enough toa small Yes vote right now.In  most EU nationals voted No, after scare stories that an iScotland would be forced to quit the EU. But since the Brexit vote and the UK government’s failure to guarantee rights to folk who’ve made their entire lives in Britain, almost every EU national still here will back independence second time around. They won’t be fooled again.Similarly, , - and -year-olds voted in  and around  per cent backed independence, according to a poll carried out by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft. Since the next indyref will also determine access to jobs in Europe, the result’s likely to be an even stronger Yes vote among young Scots next time. Last week’s ridiculous claim by David Mundell suggests he also knows how Brexit may soon change the political landscape north of the Border.The Scots Secretary said Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP actually want a no-deal Brexit to “pursue their fantasy of independence”. Mr Mundell insisted: “They pretend to oppose no deal, yet no deal is their real aim. They hope it will cause chaos, confusion and boost support for independence. Everything  that they do or say on Brexit has been a publicity stunt.”Now a man who shares party membership with Chris ‘no resignation’ Grayling, Boris ‘zipwire’ Johnson and Jacob ‘backstop-ultimatum’ Rees Mogg has clearly had practice in recognising the hallmarks of the cynical gesture and the empty stunt. But suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wants a no deal Brexit – are you having a laugh  Since Mr Mundell has clearly been on another planet for the last two years, he’s missed the fact that Sturgeon’s been getting pelters from Yessers for appearing more interested in saving Britain than readying Scotland for indyref. Chaos might well look like “the best backdrop for another campaign for independence” to politicians who are quite prepared to break up Britain and wreck livelihoods over hysterical fears about foreign workers and dogmatic beliefs about the benefits of unregulated free trade, but there’s been no occasion over the last two years when the First Minister has forgotten the entirely negative long-term impact of Brexit on Scotland, realising that dferent cross-border trade arrangements aren’t ideal birthing conditions for any new state.You can only conclude that the sudden eruption of rattling by Tories north and south of the Border means Whitehall expects the SNP leader to call for another Section  order sooner rather than later.And why might that be – because any kind of Brexit, hard or soft, on  March or a few months later, opens up a whole new set of scenarios for Scotland.Once Britain has actually withdrawn from the EU, it’s likely that the EU and the smaller trade body EFTA will approach Scotland offering rival membership deals in the event of a vote for independence second time around.Senior officials in Iceland are openly discussing the many advantages of having Scotland as a new member of the EFTA halfway house and thereby creating a powerful bloc with three contiguous North Atlantic states controlling vital sea routes, fishing grounds, oil and gas fields and a vast wind, marine and geothermal renewable energy resource. If Gavin McCrone was writing another memerandum to ministers today about the strategic and economic potential of such a move, he might again conclude an independent Scotland “would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree”, eventhe big income from decades of oil and gas predicted  years ago has largely been squandered by successive UK governments.Meanwhile, academics at the recent Oxford conference on Rewriting the UK Constitution have predicted that the EU will make a public offer to Scotland once Brexit means there’s no further risk in offending Britain and no conflict of interest in wooing the Scots instead. And why wouldn’t the EU want us  Regaining five million generally progressive, pro-EU citizens in the wake of Britain’s acrimonious departure would be an important boost to the European project.Any bidding war between EFTA and the EU would serve to bolster the viability of Scottish independence, consolidate a new Brexit-oriented strategy and increase support for another Scottish vote. Of course who knows what will happen next with Brexit Theresa May’s deal may get the go-ahead, but her new assurances on the Irish backstop may not satisfy Brexiteers. An extension to Article , allowing time for a second Brexit vote, might let the SNP trade support for an understanding on a future Section  order. In short, things are hotting up on the independence front even though the issue and the SNP have been virtually cut out of mainstream political debate.Momentum is building and those opposing Scotland’s right to self-determination in the light of Brexit know it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli celebrities like stacey dooley should think twice about comic relief","story":"There are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country#s complicity in their plight, writes Dani GaravelliIt’s a shame an important discussion about the tone of Comic Relief has been focused so directly, and so vituperatively, on one woman – Stacey Dooley, and I can’t help wonderingthe fact she’s glamorous and female has something to do with how she has been targeted. I am not suggesting the Instagram photograph she posted with a random black child on her hip is unproblematic. MP David Lammy was right to point out it plays on all those tired old “white saviour” tropes. But Dooley is not just some C-list celebrity who has popped her head into Uganda to boost her own profile. She may currently be dancing on Strictly, but she is also a documentary maker with a track record of tackling serious subjects: sweat shops, people trafficking and child soldiers. Forcing her to take the flak for the cloying paternalism of Comic Relief seems harsh and lets an awful lot of other people off the hook.Thirty years after Live Aid, most people of my generation, who sang along with gusto to Do They Know It’s Christmas  cannot hear the line: “So tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” without a visceral sense of shame. We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage. I went to a clinic for HIV sufferers, and I went to a slum’.”Dooley is not a villain. She shouldn’t be expected to carry the can for Comic Relief’s enduring colonialism. But perhapsshe and others were exposed to more voices like McGrath’s, they would think twice about treating black children like some sort of fashion accessory. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"liam fox brexiteer tests are genuine attempt to resolve deal impasse","story":"The prospect of the UK government#s Brexit deal being backed by MPs has edged #closer after a senior Cabinet member welcomed a move by rebel MPs to find #common territory#.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a series of tests unveiled by the Brexit-backing European Research Groupwhich would secure their support was a “genuine attempt” to resolve the current impasse.It comes amid growing speculation that Brexiteer Tories, along with dozens of Labour MPs, are preparing to vote for the government’s deal rather than risk the growing possibility of seeing Brexit delayed or even overturned through a second referendum.Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential  Committee of backbench Tories, expressed optimism that a breakthrough on the Irish border backstop was close.The hardline ERG, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has indicated a more conciliatory tone on the issue. Three tests have been drawn up by the group which the government must pass to win backing, according to a newspaper report yesterday. The stance has been drawn up in conjunction with the DUP.In private talks with Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the ERG called for a legally-binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the government’s legal advice, the newspaper said.Mr Fox said: “I hope it’s a ­genuine attempt – and I think it is – to try to map out common territory.”He claimed that the offer to MPs of a vote on delaying the UK’s departurePrime Minister Theresa May’s deal does not get through Parliament would not mean Brexit was overturned. Labour is now backing a People’s Vote and momentum is building towards a second referendum.But Mr Fox added: “To attempt to have a delay mechanism in order to thwart the process of Brexit itself is actually politically completely unacceptable. And, as I have said before, would provoke a backlash amongst voters.”Sir Graham made clear he could swing behind the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement ahead of crunch Commons votes.Writing in a Sunday newspaper, he said: “The whole country is tired of vacillation and delay. When the right compromise is offered, we should pull together behind the Prime Minister and help her to deliver our exit from the European Union on  March.”Many Brexiteers have expressed opposition to the Irish border backstop as it would mean the UK obeying EU customs rulesno wider trade deal is agreed after a transition period.Sir Graham – who branded the government’s handling of Brexit negotiations as “lions led by donkeys” – indicated there was a growing mood for a deal in the Commons. He said: “My conversations with senior diplomats and politicians from across Europe have given me cause for optimism that a breakthrough is near.”Michael Tomlinson MP said the group needed to see “black and white” text in good time before the Commons votes.He said: “There is a spectrum and a range of options that the Attorney General has.

That must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control.“These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell branded the initiative a “desperate bribe”.He said: “This towns fund smacks of desperation from a Government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation.”The Independent Group’s Brexit spokeswoman Anna Soubry said the move was a “desperate measure to buy votes”.Ms Soubry said: “Voters will not be fooled, especially those in areas which voted Leave and are now demanding a People’s Vote because they know, whichever way you do it, Brexit will harm their futures.”The Stronger Towns Fund, launched today, will be “targeted at places that have not shared in the proceeds of growth in the same way as more prosperous parts of the country,” ministers said.Of the £ billion being allocated using a needs-based formula, the North West gets £ million, the West Midlands £m, Yorkshire and the Humber £m, the East Midlands £m, the North East £m, the South East £m, the South West £m and the East of England £m.Another £ million will be available through a bidding process to communities in any part of the country.The ERG has set out three tests that they will judge Mr Cox’s efforts to secure changes to the backstop on.The group wants a legally binding, treaty level arrangement, the language must not just simply reiterate the temporary nature of the backstop, and there “needs to be a clear and unconditional route out” of the arrangement.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his party must see legally binding and treaty-level changes to the withdrawal agreement regarding the backstop in order to support it.He told BBC Radio ’s Westminster Hour: “We need something which, whatever its legal form, has legal binding effect and which changes the current meaning of the withdrawal agreement.“And which makes clear that it cannot be indefinite, and it cannot be a trap both for the United Kingdom generally and for Northern Ireland in particular.”The PM said thather deal is rejected, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, andthat is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article  and delay Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots outlander fans to get chance to quiz creator diana gabaldon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Outlander fans are being offered the chance to quiz author Diana Gabaldon at a stately home that features in the hit TV show.The US writer will take part in a conversation event at Hopetoun House near South Queensferry on March .Fans will recognise the attraction from the screen adaptation of her historical time travel series, which concluded its fourth season in January.Author James Crawford will chair the evening in the Red Drawing Room, which appeared as the home of the Duke of Sandringham in series one.Outlander follows the adventures of English nurse Claire Randall, who travels back in time from s Scotland to the th century, where she meets and falls in love with Highlander Jamie Fraser.• : Outlander quiz: How well do you know the Scottish series The first book was published in  and it was adapted for television in .Fans of the series have since flocked from Europe and North America to visit locations featured in the show.The Hopetoun House event has been organised by VisitScotland and Publishing Scotland, with support from United Airlines.Jenni Steele from VisitScotland said: “The Outlander books and subsequent TV series have had a huge impact on tourism in Scotland, inspiring thousands of travellers to visit our shores.• : Outlander continues to drive record figures at Scotland’s heritage sites“It is only fitting that fans will get the chance to hear from the award-winning author in the sumptuous Hopetoun House, which will be familiar to viewers.”Marion Sinclair from Publishing Scotland added: “Books and storytelling have long been the source of cinematic and TV adaptations and Outlander is one of the major page-to-screen stories of the past decade in Scotland.“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from Diana Gabaldon about how her writing served as the inspiration for the series.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"700k of premium bonds prizes unclaimed in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s them interacting, and my favourite part is I’ll ask questions and they’ll type in their little answers.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  So engaging are the reading sessions that families have started tuning in from across the USA, something it’s fair to say has taken Dr George by surprise.“It’s a little weird! I’m a very open person, I love kids and to me I’m just reading a book to my babies,” she said. The success of Tucked-in Tuesdays has inevitably led to authors reaching out, with some sending books and even offering to come and read at the school.Meanwhile Dr George has extended invitations to authors to join her as guests, while one student has been so inspired that he has been writing a story for her to read.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But Dr George believes that perhaps the biggest lesson isn’t an educational one.“On Tuesdays I don’t go anywhere after I read because it would be horriblethe kids saw meI tucked them in and then I’m out!” she said. “That’s my Tucked-in-Tuesday as well. “The biggest lesson isn’t even educational, it’s that the kids know their principal cares beyond the end of the day. And all the other stuff, the reading and the writing, it’ll come.”"},{"url":null,"title":"this comedy writer is trying to convince everyone milk coke is a popular drink","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brummies love it. We can all move on from this discussion now, I will be taking no further questions. pic dQRbgUAO— James FeltonMarch , “I’ve been drinking it since I was a child and had the metabolism to cope with the calories involved,” he told the Press Association.Since a discussion between Mr Felton and some of his friends on Twitter about the drink on Friday, talk about milk coke has surged, with the drink receiving mixed reviews.Tried my first milk coke after learning about it on Twitter earlier today. I expected it to be bad, but I have to say my expectations were completely right. Its not good. I do not recommend mixing coke and milk— Wild GeertersMarch , Twitter user @classiclibral commented: “I expected it to be bad, but I have to say my expectations were completely right. It’s not good. I do not recommend mixing coke and milk.”Mr Felton claims the drink comes from Birmingham, saying: “The Brummie side of my family all drink it, and I have several Brummie friendswho have confirmed it’s a Brummie thing.“However it’s also a South African thing, and they call it‘Brown Milk’.”The discussion about the liquid refreshment has even seen politicians get involved, with Labour MP Wes Streeting looking to test the Birmingham theory.@jessphillips What is your position on ‘milk coke’ please — Wes Streeting MPMarch , “What is your position on ‘milk coke’ please ” he posed to fellow politician Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley. She said she had “never heard of it”.However, Mohammad Mubashir Hussain, , works in Birmingham at a legal firm and agrees with Mr Felton’s assertion that milk coke is from the city.“I work in Birmingham and was introduced to it by a colleague, at first I was repulsed and apprehensive but now I love it,” he said. “Don’t knock it till you try it. It’s a Brummie thing.”So how to drink milk coke  Well, Mr Felton says the best mixture is one third milk to two thirds coke.“You have to pour the milk in first otherwise it’ll curdle,” he added. “You’ve got about  minutes to drink it once you’ve made it, before it separates.“And trust me, you do not want to drink a separated milk coke.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Felton recommends people try milk coke “because it’s delicious” and has “all the flavour of a coke float without the hassle of having to own ice cream”.But he also offers some words of caution.“It definitely shouldn’t be a craze, I don’t want to give the whole UK diabetes,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"martin galvin former noraid chief deported derry uncovers document linked exclusion order","story":"EXCLUSIVEA leading American campaigner for Irish reunication has said the emergence of a previously classied British document is proof he was banned from entering the North in the s because of an offer to engage with British Government officials and leading unionist politician-not because he supported the IRA campaign.Martin Galvin has also revealed that when the exclusion order against him was eventually lted in , he was told of the decision by British agent within Sinn Fein and the IRA Denis Donaldson, later murdered by dissident republicans in a remote area of Donegal in .Martin Galvin was served an Exclusion Order in  barring him from entering Northern Ireland.  At the time, he was publicity director of Northern Irish Aid - a NewYork based organisation founded at the outset of the Troubles in .NORAID was founded to raise money for the families of republican prisoners but became caught up in major controversy when its organisers were accused of using the funds to supply arms to the IRA.The New York based lawyer last visited Derry around two weeks ago as part of a U.S. Ancient Order of Hibernian delegation. And, it was just before his arrival in Derry for the visit that he learned of the surfacing of the British document in question.In August,  Martin Galvin led a group of  Americans on a fact-finding tour of the North organised by Sinn Fein. The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation. When we met in the Guildhall with eight councillors and Deputy Mayor Derek Hussey, I referred to the memo and noted that the last time I brought an American delegation to the north and requested a meeting with the British and unionists I had been sent an Exclusion Order in reply.\"CAPTION: Martin Galvin being arrested by the RUC at Free Derry Corner in . The late Martin McGuinness can be seen on the fringe of the left handside of the phoptograph."},{"url":null,"title":"mobuoy toxic dump clean dependent funding says government department","story":"A government department has said that remediation works at the Mobuoy Road “toxic super dump” in Derry will not commence unless funding is secured.The comments made by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairscome ahead of a scheduled community meeting at Drumahoe Primary School on March  at which people have been encouraged to demand answers and a clean-up of the site after years of inaction.The Mobuoy Road waste site consists of two distinct parcels of land, namely the City Industrial WasteSite and the Campsie Sands and Gravelssite – situated .km east of Derry and occupying a signicant  hectares of land – the equivalent of  rugby pitches.It has been acknowledged by environmental experts that the illegal dump poses serious risks to the River Faughan, which runs alongside it, and supplies % of the city’s drinking water.Eamonn McCann has been vocal about the urgent need for a clean-up operation over the years and raised Mobuoy in his first speech at Stormont as an MLA.  He also said that people were aware of illegal activities at the site.Yesterday, Mark H. Durkan MLA described it as a “ticking time bomb” which could turn a “huge environmental crime” into an “even bigger environmental crisis”.Previous waste management activities on the CIW site include an old landfill regulated by the legacy Derry City Council.At the stakeholder meeting on November , , the estimated volume of controlled waste illegally disposed at the Mobuoy waste site was reported to be a minimum of , m.The nature of the illegal deposits includes municipal waste, construction and demolitionwaste and municipal waste mixed with CD waste.Both the CIW site and CSG site have been subject to illegal waste disposal activities, according to local council officials.Paul Hughes has been a member of the Mobuoy Road Stakeholders Forum which has been meeting at regular intervals over the past number of years.The forum is made up of local youth and community representatives, elected representatives as well as members of the River Faughan Anglers.‘Justice for Mobuoy’At recent meetings remediation options have been explored and outlined by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency in terms of cleaning up this illegal toxic “super dump” - which is understood to be one of the biggest illegal landfills in all of Europe.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Hughes said: “We are continuously told that that the Department is working towards cleaning up the dump. Its time to make it happen. At a recent meetingthe Councils Environment  Regeneration Committee the officer charged with heading up the clean-up said that they have been lucky with Mobuoy so far. What a statement to make.“Mobuoy Dump must be cleaned up without further delay. The floods of August  proved just how fragile the situation is.  The River Faughan remains under constant threat from pollution.“We should all be concerned about the issue.  We must all stand up for the Faughan.  I would encourage everyone to get along to this meeting and ask questions. I would suggest that everyone writes down all their questions and puts them directly to the NIEA on Wednesday th of March.”He added: “Our elected representatives have failed Mobuoy and have failed the River Faughan.  Despite a public inquiry having been unanimously agreed back in , it never ever happened.“Its time for concerned citizens to take control of this process and now is the time to demand that Mobuoy Dump be cleaned up once and for all and lessons learnt do that a disaster like this is never allowed to happen again.“It’s time to stand up for the River Faughan.  Make a point to attending this meeting, demand answers, demand a full clean up, demand a public inquiry. Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier.

I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of. The pupils of Downpatrick and beyond have amalgamated through collaboration at GCSE and GCE level.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal.

But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.\"Mrs May said she would seek \"legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The deaths has been reported to the coroner.It comes as almost , patient accidents or falls were reported between November  and December .Of the five unexpected deaths to patients known to mental health services, one was found hanging at home but the cause of deaths of the other patients are not yet confirmed.One dental patient was diagnosed withsquamous cell carcinoma ndash a form of skin cancer ndash having previously been downgraded from urgent to routine.Another patient suffered a stroke after ldquofollow-up processes were not followed and had not started blood thinning treatment, while another patient died whilst on the cardiac surgery waiting list.In another serious incident, an eye disorder patientrsquos sight ldquodeteriorated signicantly after not being offered a follow-up appointment.A regulation  report ndash which is sent to organisations when a coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent further deaths ndash has also been sent to the health board since the end of November.The report relates to an inquest in which the coroner concluded that a patient died after taking a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication on an in-patient ward at University Hospital of Wales.The medication was not locked away in his bedside cupboard, which contravened the medicines code patient property policies, a health board report says.The health board report says: ldquoThe management of patientrsquos own medication is one which presents a particular challenge in the healthcare environment. Following the incident the UHB has carried out a benchmarking exercise across the UK and it does not appear that there is anyone centre that has managed to put an effective solution in place.ldquoWhile patients are always encouraged to hand over all medication or to send it home with family, there are many practical issues that make this dficult to implement and monitor robustly. Medication is the patientrsquos own property and they can refuse to hand it over should they wish. Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Tories have slashed many billions from budgets of poorest councils since   now they want us to feel grateful for the pittance they intend to dole outover six years. Its corrupt, patronising, pathetic. All to appease the Brexit monster.mdash Chris BryantMarch , Launching the new pound. billion Stronger Towns Fund package,Mrs May said: ldquoFor too long in our country prosperity has been unfairly spread.ldquoCommunities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change ndash that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control.ldquoThese towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.Mr McDonnell branded the initiative a ldquodesperate bribe.He said: ldquoThis Towns Fund smacks of desperation from a Government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation.But Mr Brokenshiretold BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that the money was not linked to getting the deal through.ldquoThis funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our

Geoffrey Cox has reportedly abandoned key demands over the Brexit backstop Asked about the Dailyreport, Mr Brokenshire said: ldquoThe Attorney General continues with his work to ensure that we get legally binding changes to ensure that we are not locked in the backstop.He said Mr Cos would be ldquoback to Brussels this week to continue the discussions to make sure that we can get those legal

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share.

But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
