His name? I\u0027ll never tell\u0027.           The 70-year-old details her heartbreaking losses and struggles in her new memoir, Don\u0027t Stop Believin\u0027, released TuesdayAs a little girl growing up in Australia after moving from Cambridge, England, in the 1950s, Olivia loved hiding in an alcove halfway up the stairs and watching the glamorous friends of her academic parents arrive to pick them up for evening festivities.If they were staying in and she was allowed downstairs - she rushed down to light cigarettes for everyone.\u0027I liked the smell of the sulfur of the match and the burning tobacco and paper\u0027.Her father even smoked when he was reading her bedtime stories.Olivia writes: \u0027I must have associated comfort with smoke, although now I know cigarettes and secondhand smoke are toxic for your health\u0027.When her mother saw her lighting cigarettes at a university function, she suggested that Olivia try one and handed her an entire pack.\u0027I was nine and thought this was a splendid idea. I sparked up a cigarette\u0027.She took a deep breath on her mother\u0027s suggestion only to cough violently and swear off smoking forever.Years later when living in London, she took up smoking again thinking it would give her a sultry singing voice like Julie London. But she had the same coughing reaction.\u0027I can still remember my father\u0027s smoke lingering on the sleeves of my pink cotton pjs. I\u0027d go to sleep smelling him with my nose pressed to my pajama sleeve\u0027.Her father\u0027s death from liver cancer in 1992 would be her first exposure to cancer, and in a cruel twist of fate - he died the same weekend she was diagnosed with breast cancer.          Olivia shot to stardom with her role of Sandy in Grease in 1978 with co-star John Travolta Newton-John writes: \u0027Honestly, I had thought that I would retire, that it was the end of my career, but music kept appearing to me in my head and in my heart.\u0027I didn\u0027t retreat from my career but rather I went through the fire and reinvented it\u0027. Following her first bout with cancer and the breakdown of her marriage to Lattanzi in 1995 - Newton-John recalls her doctor Dr. Khalsa asking her if she was having any troubles with a man because \u0027some believe cancer in the right breast corresponds to a male figure\u0027. Olivia met her second husband John Easterling through mutual friends while walking the Great Wall of China. \u0027True love found me when I wasn\u0027t looking\u0027, she writes.Easterling had spent the better part of his life working with plants in the Amazon Rain Forest in Peru and was known as Amazon John.She found him fascinating but he thought anyone from Hollywood involved in the music scene \u0027must be some kind of nutcase\u0027.                             He was my first major movie star encounter! His name? I\u0027ll never tell. While traversing the Great Wall, Easterling suggested he take her to meet curandero healers in Peru.Eventually she made it there with friends and he suggested drinking a hallucinatory plantvine blend guided by an experience shaman – for a mind-altering experience.Olivia wasn\u0027t interested in connecting with her higher self at the time and was afraid of any mind-altering results.But Easterling convinced her that this was \u0027just a taste so your body can receive the energetic imprint of this important medicine\u0027, John is quoted.He poured a capful and she sipped the thick, dark liquid that tasted good. Everyone began singing and then they hiked back through the forest and then off to their huts.Olivia woke up so ill around midnight, rushing to the bathroom to vomit.She crawled back to her hut and Amazon John was knocking at the door. \u0027I feel so sick\u0027, she moaned.\u0027It\u0027s not that you\u0027re sick. You\u0027re just so sensitive that you\u0027re integrating with the rain forest and the animals,\u0027 John promised her before hurrying back to his hut to retrieve a portable record player and his favorite healing music.          Olivia Newton-John revealed earlier this month she was using cannabis to treat her pain and that her second husband John Easterling (pictured) grew the plant at their California homeHe told stories about his life and what followed was what John described as \u0027a life experience together\u0027.By morning, Olivia felt clear-headed and was off of antidepressants for the first time in six months.\u0027My entire body was at peace.

She revealed earlier this month that she\u0027s using cannabis every morning and at regular intervals throughout the day to treat the pain caused by her stage four breast cancer, adding that she is seeing the benefitsOlivia writes that one of the best medicines is her husband John, who is a natural health entrepreneur, Rainforest conservationist and environmentalist who created the Amazon Herb Company.He is the love of her life and she laughs at the years of \u0027rumors that I was a lesbian, even though I had been married or had a boyfriend through most of my career\u0027.She revealed earlier this month that she\u0027s using cannabis every morning and at regular intervals throughout the day to treat the pain caused by her stage four breast cancer, adding that she is seeing the benefits.Olivia said: \u0027My husband hands me all these herbs every morning and makes me a green algae drink. \u0027He grows the plants and makes them into liquid for me. I take drops maybe four to five times a day.\u0027The couple live at a ranch in Southern California, where cannabis is legal for both medicinal and recreational use. Olivia said she decided to write her own story after being the subject of a television biopic.\u0027I think it was really prompted by the fact that they were going to do a TV movie about me and I didn\u0027t know what they were going to say,\u0027 she said.A dollar from each copy of the book sold will go towards the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness \u0026amp Research Center in Melbourne. Olivia Newton-John\u0027s book Don\u0027t Stop Believin\u0027 is out Tuesday.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Rightmove reveals Britains five viewed properties 2019","story":"    A luxurious mansion in Prestbury, a hot-spot for celebrities in the north west, valued at £3,950,000 has taken out the top spot of the most-viewed propertyA luxurious mansion in Prestbury, a hot-spot for celebrities in the north west, valued at £3,950,000 has taken out the top spot of the most-viewed property. Dubbed one of Britain\u0027s poshest villages, Prestbury has been home to the likes of Wayne and Coleen Rooney and Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy who lived in multi-million pound homes.

Steve Baker tweeted at 1am suggesting leaving the Conservatives was a possibility following a night of votes in which MPs effectively shut the door on a no-deal Brexit          Mr Baker has taken an increasingly hard line approach to Brexit and suggested the ERG would try to thwart moves to delay departure beyond March 29          Mr Baker was a Brexit minister until he quit last July over Mrs May\u0027s handling of negotiations with the EU. He stepped down at the same time as Brexit Secretary David DavisThey quit to join eight centrist Labour MPs in the Independent Group (TIG) which is demanding a second referendum.Labour\u0027s Jo Stevens, a Best for Britain supporter said: \u0027After last night\u0027s crushing rejection of a no-deal Brexit, it\u0027s no wonder Steve Baker has gone into a full-on sulk.\u0027The truth is he overplayed his hand. That\u0027s what he\u0027s really upset about. \u0027He\u0027s whinging because he thought he and his gang of Brexit extremists could bully Parliament and the country to follow his ideological daydream. That flopped spectacularly.\u0027That\u0027s the problem with the ERG. They only like Parliament taking back control when it suits their hard right project. \u0027Now it\u0027s time for the people of the UK to take back control through a public vote.\u0027Mr Baker was a Brexit minister until he quit last July over Mrs May\u0027s handling of negotiations with the EU. He stepped down at the same time as Brexit Secretary David Davis. The ERG highflier\u0027s comment came in response to a tweet from Andrew Lilico, a Brexiteer economist.The EU opens the door to delaying Brexit by up to TWO YEARS:...May will hold a THIRD vote on her Brexit deal next week as...Share this articleDr Lilico had written: \u0027So, like a lot of you, I guess, I\u0027m in search of a political party.\u0027I have in mind a party with at least a passing regard for playing by democratic rules, so obviously that rules out the Conservatives.\u0027I\u0027m neither a Communist nor an anti-Semite, so of course Labour\u0027s out.\u0027The PM\u0027s deal will be put to another vote next week, just 15 days before the country is due to leave the EU on 29 March, after MPs including a \u0027gang of four\u0027 rebellious Cabinet members helped to vote to permanently rule out No Deal Brexit.Mrs May told the Commons that is she loses a third time she will forced to ask Brussels for a long delay to Britain\u0027s departure from the EU at a summit on Thursday.Mr Baker had been one of a number of Tory MPs who had backed a unity amendment designed to allow the UK to leave without a deal, but delay that departure until May.But that amendment was heavily defeated in the Commons as MPs moved towards a longer delay to Brexit.Last night Mr Baker branded the situation a \u0027fiasco\u0027, telling ITV\u0027s Peston the ERG could try to prevent the law being changed to alter the scheduled exit date from the EU.    The PM\u0027s deal will be put to another vote next week, just 15 days before the country is due to leave the EU on 29 MarchHe said: \u0027As a matter of practice, unless the law is changed, we leave on March 29.\u0027There are some things that we could do to prevent the law going through in the time that is available.\u0027He also lashed out at ministers who abstained from the no-deal votes without having to quit, adding: \u0027It is, of course, extraordinary to see such a collapse in discipline.\u0027And in any other circumstances, of course, they would be fired.\u0027Of course I\u0027m sad about it.

but the UK will still crash out on March 29 unless a deal or an extension is agreed before then. Mr Grayling has been under fire over the Brexit planning process since it emerged that a shipping firm which won a Government contract did not own any ferries.The £13.8million deal with Seaborne Freight sparked widespread concern and ridicule, and was terminated last month.   The Government was forced to pay £33million to Eurotunnel to settle a legal action over the contracts, prompting further calls for Mr Grayling to resign.             Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured in Downing Street this week, has faced pressure to quit over his handling of the Brexit preparations           Lorries parked in a queue during a trial at the former Manston Airport site in Kent of a government plan to hold lorries there in the event of post-Brexit disruption          A picture from 1989 showing planes at the then-Kent International Airport Manston was first used as an airfield in 1915, during the First World War when military aircraft used the site for emergency landings. It was heavily used during World War II, including by Hawker Typhoon and Gloster Meteor squadrons, according to planning documents. During the Cold War it was put into used by the United States Air Force, who used it as a strategic air command base for fighter and bomber units. It became a civilian and RAF airport in 1960 when American forces withdrew, and was rebranded as Kent International Airport in 1989. The Ministry of Defence sold the site in 1998 and never made a profit after that, passing through several owners until it closed in 2014.  Short-lived budget airline EUJet had used the site as a hub, launching services to 21 European destinations, but the firm collapsed in 2005. "},{"url":null,"title":"MPs vote AGAINST second referendum time","story":"Share this articleTheresa May warned a dozen Eurosceptic ministers could quit to back a Brexit Malthouse \u0027Plan B\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Medics tie violent psychotic pregnant woman perform C section","story":"    A judge ruled that the woman did not have the mental capacity to make birthing decisions (stock image of pregnant woman having a scan)At a hearing in London, the judge concluded that the woman lacked the mental capacity to make decisions regarding birth options and that a caesarean would be in the best interests of both her and the baby.Mrs Justice Knowles analysed evidence at a hearing in the Court of Protection, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions.She said the woman could not be identified in media reports of the case.Publish EVERY word of Mueller: House of Representatives...\u0027Papa\u0027s not breathing!\u0027 Gambino boss Frank Cali, 53, is...A bloody outrage: Veterans\u0027 fury as ex-British soldier WILL...Share this article    The judge was also told that the woman\u0027s sister was in favour of delivery by caesarean section (stock image of pregnant woman above)Bosses at two NHS trusts with responsibility for the woman\u0027s maternity care and mental health treatment had asked the judge to rule that delivery by caesarean section would be in the best interests of the woman and her baby.The judge said neither trust could be named in media reports and that journalists could give no indication of where in England the woman lived.She said she did not want to run the risk of reporters creating an information jigsaw which might reveal the woman\u0027s identity.Mrs Justice Knowles, who is based in the Family Division of the High Court in London, heard evidence from specialists and legal argument from lawyers representing the two trusts and the woman.The woman was represented by staff from the office of the Official Solicitor, who help vulnerable people at the centre of litigation.She was told that the woman\u0027s sister was also in favour of delivery by caesarean section."},{"url":null,"title":"RAF fliers nicknamed Doorknob Bamber Tornado flight","story":"    Squadron leader Ian Dornan (left) and Squadron leader Stephen Beardmore walk away from their jet after the final Tornado flight over RAF Marham in Norfolk           A final flypast of a single Tornado aircraft takes place over RAF Marham in Norfolk, during a disbandment parade for the final two Tornado Squadrons          RAF personnel look to the skies as the final flypast of a single Tornado aircraft takes place in Norfolk after almost four decades of service for the supersonic jet The black box that could solve Boeing crash mystery: Flight...Unexploded WWII bomb discovered at airport earmarked by...Share this articleA disbandment parade takes place for the final two Tornado Squadrons at RAF Marham today.

But I don\u0027t, like, squirm away initially, because I\u0027m like, \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 And then he lays down on top of me,\u0027 said Rapp, who detailed being pressed up against the bed before being able to squirm away and ultimately leave the house without being assaulted by Spacey.          Usual suspect: Spacey is also on trial in Massachusetts for allegedly groping a teen, who said he was 23 at the time, while out at a bar in Nantucket (above in January at his arraignment) Spacey made the decision to come out of the closet in a statement apologizing to actor Anthony Rapp, who said in an interview that the actor attempted to sexually assault him in 1986, an incident Spacey says he does not remember.Rapp was 14 at the time while Spacey was 26.The actor did get a bit of good news last week in his criminal case.Lawyers for the disgraced Oscar winner presented multiple motions to the judge, and while none of those motions have been ruled on, the judge did order that the man accusing Spacey of assault and his girlfriend-at-the-time preserve their phone and cloud records.The defense wants to extend the time period for which they can obtain any texts of saved information in the accuser\u0027s cloud from January 2017 to December 2017.That was the lone decision handed down on Monday, with the judge promising to rule on the other motions at the next hearing on April 4 in Nantucket.Spacey was not in court, after being told back in January that he would not be needed for the appearance.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook shares tank nearly two cent 17 hour partial outage","story":"    Facebook\u0027s stock dropped nearly 2 per cent (depicted above) after a 17-hour partial outage made the world\u0027s largest social network inaccessible to users across the globe          But by then Facebook\u0027s shares fell 1.72 per cent in morning trading on Thursday.

File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe The organisers of the Drogheda St Parick’s Day parade have cited health and safety as the reason behind their curb on Irish dancers and gymnasts performing along the route. The organisers sent out a press release to local media saying they had been advised by gardaí that the tradition of groups stopping to perform for the crowds during the parade was “unsafe” and could not be continued. A spokeswoman said: “It’s unfortunate, as people do enjoy watching the Irish dancers or other performance schools, but this causes delays and gaps in the parade, and can be unsafe as other groups catch up. “So we are appealing to groups to show themselves off, keep on marching, and ensure that the parade moves along smoothly together. It’s out of our hands at this stage, and we hope to see all our participants from Drogheda, Louth, Meath and further afield taking part again on Sunday at 12 noon.” The chairman of Drogheda’s St Patrick’s Day parade, Anthony Lynch, said some of the media coverage of the decision had got “completely out of hand”. Mr Lynch stressed Irish dancers had in previous years performed in front of the main stage along the route, but this had held up the parade for those following on behind. “It was causing a massive gap in the parade. We’ve been trying to stop it for years,” he said. “We shifted the viewing stand to stop these gaps.” Mr Lynch pointed out that in previous years the gaps were so wide that many spectators thought the parade was over and went home. “We have from four-year-olds up marching in the parade. They will be in these flimsy little uniforms and March is no time to be stood around waiting on a cold and windy street.” Mr Lynch stressed that Irish dancers will still be able to perform, provided they keep moving while they are dancing. This is the model that has been adopted in the American parades. “We are running this parade for the last 33 years. It has never been suggested to ban anything. It has been taken out of proportion,” Mr Lynch said. The decision not to allow the dancers to stop and perform prompted a headline in the Irish Daily Star stating that “the jig’s up”, with the paper saying it was a case of “health and safety gone trad”. The Drogheda parade will feature 70 community groups, clubs, societies and local businesses. It will be lead by the Drogheda Brass Band and will also include the local Lourdes Brass Band, as well as a band from Northern Ireland.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May is seen in the House of Commons, London, on Thursday. Photograph: UK parliamentJessica TaylorPA WireMPs have voted to delay Britain’s departure from the EU by at least three months as talks continue between Theresa May’s government and the DUP in an effort to save the withdrawal agreement. The government’s motion calling for an extension of the article 50 negotiating deadline passed by 412 votes to 202.But most Conservatives voted against the motion in a free vote that saw eight cabinet ministers including Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay oppose it. The prime minister hopes to put the Brexit deal to a third vote in the House of Commons before next Wednesday and if it passes, she will seek a short extension until June 30th to pass implementation legislation.If the deal is rejected, she will seek a longer extension and offer MPs a chance to vote on alternative options on Monday, March 25th. European Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that he would ask EU leaders to be open to a long extension “if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy and build consensus around it”.The government is seeking to persuade the DUP to support the Brexit deal if attorney general Geoffrey Cox can change his legal advice about the risk of the Northern Ireland backstop enduring indefinitely. The two sides are also understood to be talking about guarantees from London that Northern Ireland will not have to erge from British regulations and about extra funding for Northern Ireland.Along with Barclay, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss and Gavin Williamson voted against the government motion, to delay the scheduled March 29th exit.Emerging optionsSpeaking in Washington, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed the House of Commons vote, saying it reduces the likelihood of a cliff edge, no-deal Brexit on March 29th.“But we now need to hear from London about what purpose an extension would serve and how long it would last,” he said.He said there seems to be “two emerging options”. These are “ratification of the withdrawal agreement followed by a short extension into the summer”, or “a much longer extension that would give the UK time and space to decide what they want to do”. This would include “considering options that had been taken off the table like participation in the customs union and single market”.“I think we need to be open to any request they make, listen attentively and be generous in our response,” Mr Varadkar said.“This matter will be now discussed further at next week’s European Council meeting and hopefully we will have more clarity from London in the meantime about their intentions. Unanimity by the 27 will be required for any extension.”Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told RTÉ earlier on Thursday: “If you have a long extension of, say, 21 months, to the end of 2020 — whatever the period would be — then Britain has a legal entitlement to have representation in the European Parliament” and so must take part in forthcoming EU elections.Second referendumDuring Thursday’s ballots, British MPs voted against an amendment for a second Brexit referendum, after voting on such a proposal for the first time.MPs also rejected a cross-party amendment submitted by Labour’s Hilary Benn and supported by his fellow Labour MP Yvette Cooper plus seven others, including the Conservatives Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve.A further amendment to this “indicative votes” plan, tabled by Labour’s Lucy Powell, was rejected. It would have limited to June 30th any extension of Brexit talks to discuss parliament’s preferred option.A Labour frontbench amendment was also defeated in the Commons. The amendment instructed Mrs May to seek an unspecified extension to article 50 to avoid exiting the EU on March 29th without a deal and “to provide parliamentary time for this House to find a majority for a different approach”.That would have implied a long extension, as few believe that a radically different Brexit deal to the one already negotiated by Mrs May can be agreed quickly with the EU.A fourth and final amendment from Chris Bryant, a Labour backbencher, was withdrawn. Mr Bryant wanted MPs to vote on whether to block a third “meaningful vote” on Mrs May’s existing Brexit deal.Third voteAhead of the ballots, it emerged Mrs May was set to put her twice-rejected Brexit deal to a vote in the House of Commons again, piling pressure on rebel politicians to back her battered agreement.The latest developments come amid reports the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has signalled her party is ready to do a deal to end the Brexit impasse. Tory eurosceptics told the  that they and the DUP could be persuaded to back Mrs May’s Brexit deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gave clearer legal advice about how the UK could withdraw from an international treaty.Mr Bercow unexpectedly selected the second referendum amendment from Sarah Wollaston. Ms Wollaston, who recently defected from the Conservatives to the Independent Group, had won support from the Liberal Democrats for her amendment.It said that the UK’s exit from the European Union should be delayed for the purpose of “legislating for and conducting a public vote” in which staying in the EU is an option on the ballot paper.Many members of Labour abstained from the vote on the second referendum, after all of the party’s MPs were ordered to do so.ComplaintsThere were complaints in the Commons after Mr Bercow refused to select another amendment, opposing a second referendum, which had attracted the support of 111 MPs, mostly hardline Brexiteer Conservatives, with the support of the DUP and a handful of Labour MPs.It called on MPs to declare that “the result of the 2016 EU referendum should be respected and that a second EU referendum would be isive and expensive and therefore should not take place”.Signatories of the amendment in the name of the Conservative MP Lee Rowley included Boris Johnson and Bill Cash, plus the DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Labour MPs including Gareth Snell, Denis Skinner, Kate Hoey and John Mann.Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reported on Thursday night that Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable will step down as the leader of his party after local elections in May.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: European Parliment\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSabine Weyand, deputy negotiator for the EU. Photograph: Dario PignatelliGetty Brussels has said a vote by UK MPs to block a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances is a meaningless move, with one senior EU negotiator describing it as “the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way”.A European commission spokesman offered a withering assessment of the decision by MPs to ignore Theresa May’s assertion that no deal was the default position unless there was a deal in place by the time of the UK’s departure.“We take note of the votes in the House of Commons this evening,” the spokesman said. “There are only two ways to leave the EU: with or without a deal. The EU is prepared for both. To take no deal off the table, it is not enough to vote against no deal – you have to agree to a deal. We have agreed a deal with the prime minister, and the EU is ready to sign it.”British MPs voted by 312 to 308 to support a backbench amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit and striking out a phrase in a government-backed motion noting that no deal remained the default position in UK and EU law if an agreement was not ratified.On Thursday, MPs will vote on whether to request an extension of the article 50 negotiating period beyond March 29th until June 30th.MPs will have also the opportunity to vote on up to four amendments to Mrs May’s proposed delay to Brexit on Thursday, speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said.Mr Bercow said he had selected an amendment put forward by a group of independent lawmakers calling for a second referendum on Brexit, as well as one proposed by the Labour Party that calls for Mrs May to use a Brexit delay to give parliament time “to find a majority for a different approach”.The final two selected are a plan to take control of the parliamentary agenda with the aim of forcing a discussion of Brexit options, and one that takes issue with the prospect of the government bringing Mrs May’s deal back unchanged for a third “meaningful” vote.Extra timeMichel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, speaking to the European parliament in Strasbourg earlier on Wednesday, questioned whether the EU should offer extra time for talks, leading officials to prepare for all options to be on the table at a leaders’ summit next week.“Why would we extend these discussions?” Mr Barnier asked. “The discussion on article 50 is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement. It is there.”During a private meeting before his public comments, Mr Barnier advised senior MEPs that at present there was no consensus among the EU’s member states over an extension, let alone on the conditions that would be attached.At the same time, the EU’s deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, told EU ambassadors that she feared the Commons was “orced from reality”.Quoting private remarks by the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, Ms Weyand concurred with his description of the decision to vote for no deal as “like the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way”.Ms Weyand said the second defeat for Mrs May’s deal on Tuesday night showed that “a short technical extension” of article 50 talks should be ruled out. A long extension would only be on offer in the event of a general election or second referendum.But France and Germany are among several countries who want to see more flexibility.It is understood the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had let it be known during a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh last month that she would regard an extension until the end of June, by which time European parliament elections will have been held, but MEPs will not have sat, as relatively straightforward.Dr Merkel had said an extension up until the European elections at the end of May was “very easy”, with a delay until the chamber convenes in July described as “easy”.The ambassadors concluded at the meeting with Ms Weyand that an extension could be decided only by EU leaders, who will assess the question at the summit next Thursday, and will need to agree unanimously on any response to a request.While various extension times have been mooted – from five weeks to 21 months – there is no consensus. Member states have refused to endorse a commission proposal that any extension should be a one-off.Thorny problemThe thorny problem of the need for British MEPs in the event of an extension beyond the European elections starting on Mrs May 22nd was raised during the meeting with ambassadors.The EU’s lawyers said it was a “grey area” if the UK remained a member state between Mrs May and the end of June but that MEPs would almost certainly be needed to be elected after that.The lawyers said a mooted treaty change to avoid such a scenario was not possible as the shortest such revision had taken two and a half years. “That’s dead,” said a diplomat involved.With Downing Street likely to try to put Mrs May’s deal to the Commons again in the coming days, the German foreign minister, Heiko Mass, said: “Germany has prepared itself in the best possible way for the worst-case scenario. However, we still hope that we can avoid an unregulated Brexit – it is still in the hands of the House of Commons to do that.”– , ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photographer: Callaghan O’HareBloombergIn a country where “liberalism” means big government and “neoconservatism” implies utopian daring-do, the mangling of another abstract noun was probably due.What US politics has done to “socialism” over recent months is no less regrettable for that.Whether in the mouths of Democrats, who are warming to the word, or of Republicans, who still spit it out, it has come to mean something more familiar to a European as social (or Christian) democracy.Fiscal transfers, universal healthcare, powerful trade unions: not only do these things not add up to socialism – Denmark is no command economy – a true stickler for that creed would actively oppose them as efforts to buy off the revolution.They are not designed to replace the market so much as to stop the masses turning against it.All of which provokes a counter-intuitive thought. Hardened capitalists should vote for a Democratic president in 2020 – even a fairly left-wing one – rather than a Republican.The market system is under greater popular stress, after all, than at any time since the 1930s. One answer to the resentment is to give no quarter at all. A wiser one is to contain the anger by making pragmatic concessions to it.Donald Trump won the presidency by taking the second approach but has governed, mystifyingly, with the first.Colour-by-numbers RepublicanismHaving begun his White House campaign with a pledge to save not just Medicare (which serves the old) but Medicaid (which serves the poor), he has cut taxes and is now seeking welfare efficiencies to make up the budgetary shortfall.After all his vaunted “disruption” of GOP orthodoxy, he seems set to run on a platform of colour-by-numbers Republicanism, at least in domestic affairs.If this is the right’s plan to save the free-market system, then capitalists should take their chances with the left. There is a plausible future in which a more generous welfare state, funded by taxes on those who have been enriched by a decade’s asset inflation, drains some of the anti-capitalist pus from the body politic.There is no plausible future in which another round of unreconstructed supply-side economics does the same.One more presidential term of this stuff would be a tactical gain for free-marketeers, true, but what of the strategic risk?For the short-term pleasure of lower marginal tax rates and thinned-out regulations, they risk the further disillusionment of an electorate that already worries about the fairness of the system. Millennial attitudes to capitalism should keep them up at night.The transient nuisance of a “progressive” administration should not. The priority of capitalists is not the election of Republicans. It is the maintenance of public support for capitalism.If this is best achieved through some redistribution and regulation, it would not be the first time.As ever in politics, the trick is to distinguish between lesser and greater evils.Consider the sulphurous unpopularity on Wall Street of Elizabeth Warren.Even potential Democratic donors wonder what they will do if the Massachusetts senator becomes the party’s candidate in 2020. Her crime?A taste for wealth taxes and financial regulation. It is natural for bankers to worry about these policies.But they should also worry about the anger that will be stored up if some variation of her reform does not happen.Warren is “a capitalist to my bones”.She wants more, not less competition in the economy. If capitalists think that four or eight years of her leftish technocracy is the worst that can happen, they are not using their imaginations.Better her than a more severe reckoning with public opinion down the line. Better a controlled explosion than a random, all-engulfing one.Right now, the political debate concerns the excesses of capitalism. In no time at all, it will move on to the fundaments of the system itself.Too much beliefThe preservation of capitalism through its moderation: there is no paradox here.Dwight Eisenhower understood it as basic statecraft, as did Richard Nixon and other Republicans who reconciled themselves to big government. Trump reached a similar intuition in 2016.At least as far back as John Maynard Keynes, the truest friends of capitalism have understood that it cannot command an electoral majority in its purest form.Franklin Roosevelt turned out to be a better custodian of the system than those who cried philosophical betrayal at first whiff of the New Deal.He knew that an idea can die of purity. Too few now do.There is more to the defence of free markets than the resistance of all reform as a red menace.If Republicans have become dangerous to the cause, it is because they believe in it too much.– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras celebrations new orleans pictures","story":"From children clamouring for tossed strands of beads, to revellers dressed up as blind referees poking fun at the NFL, to high school bands marching down the street, people in New Orleans, USA, celebrated Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) with flair and fun.Here: A members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure ClubComment: With no-deal off the table, Mrs May could pull off an unlikely triumphMatt Hancock mocked after saying that some nurses still stand up when a doctor enters a room, as NHS worker quips \u0026#39it isn\u0026#39t Downton Abbey\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Theresa May to hold third \u0026#39meaningful vote\u0026#39 on her deal after MPs vote to extend Article 50Exclusive: The Geoffrey Cox legal advice that Theresa May hopes will save her Brexit dealSir Vince Cable to step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats in MayPresident of European Parliament apologises for praising Benito Mussolini\u0026#39s fascist regimeSeven Cabinet ministers defy Theresa May to oppose Brexit delay as more than half of Tory MPs vote against PMComment: Does Theresa May\u0026#39s geography degree explain the mess we\u0026#39re in?Amber Rudd writes to her constituents to explain why she defied whips to keep no deal Brexit off the tableMore than 500 offenders with multiple knife crime convictions escape jailTheresa May fights off Remainer attempt to seize control of Brexit by just two votesWhat happens next now Article 50 extended and Brexit to be delayed?

But things were done, he added.With some MEPs in Brussels and politicians in Italy calling for his resignation, Mr Tajani put out a statement apologising for his remarks.As a convinced anti-fascist, I apologise to all those who may have been offended by what I said.“My remarks were in no way intended to justify or minimise an anti-democratic and totalitarian regime.”In a tweet, he wrote: The fascist dictatorship, racial laws and the deaths it caused are the darkest page in Italian and European history.Antonio Tajani, an Italian politician, is the president of the European ParliamentA close ally of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and a member of his Forza Italia party, which is in opposition, there was speculation that Mr Tajani made the remarks to appeal to Right-wing voters ahead of the European Parliament elections in May.Mr Berlusconi and his party, once dominant on the political scene, have been eclipsed by the hard-Right League, led by the pugnacious Matteo Salvini, who is both interior minister and deputy prime minister in the current coalition government.The statements by the president of the European parliament are unworthy and absolutely unacceptable, said Ska Keller, a German MEP and the head of the Greens-European Free Alliance grouping in the European Parliament.Stefano Buffagni, a junior minister in the Italian government and a member of the Five Star Movement, one half of the coalition, said: “Tajani has shown his true colours and should be ashamed of what he said about Mussolini.Please review our commenting policyComment: With no-deal off the table, Mrs May could pull off an unlikely triumphMatt Hancock mocked after saying that some nurses still stand up when a doctor enters a room, as NHS worker quips \u0026#39it isn\u0026#39t Downton Abbey\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Theresa May to hold third \u0026#39meaningful vote\u0026#39 on her deal after MPs vote to extend Article 50Exclusive: The Geoffrey Cox legal advice that Theresa May hopes will save her Brexit dealSir Vince Cable to step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats in MaySeven Cabinet ministers defy Theresa May to oppose Brexit delay as more than half of Tory MPs vote against PMComment: Does Theresa May\u0026#39s geography degree explain the mess we\u0026#39re in?Amber Rudd writes to her constituents to explain why she defied whips to keep no deal Brexit off the tableMore than 500 offenders with multiple knife crime convictions escape jailTheresa May fights off Remainer attempt to seize control of Brexit by just two votesWhat happens next now Article 50 extended and Brexit to be delayed?

The rest of the week then allows developers to get to grips with that new software and other launches.The conference will see the launch of software updates for every one of its products: new versions of\u0026nbspiOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.As well as those software updates, Apple often uses the WWDC event as a moment to reveal the future of other products, too. This year, much of the focus is going to be on the possibility of Apple\u0027s long-promised new Mac Pro, though it\u0027s likely other announcements will be made at the same time.“WWDC is Apple’s biggest event of the year. It brings thousands of the most creative and dedicated developers from around the world together with over a thousand Apple engineers to learn about our latest platform innovations and to connect as a community,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.“Our developers are incredibly passionate about creating the next generation of mind-blowing experiences for the world through apps. We can’t wait to get together with them and share what’s next.”Developers can apply for tickets from today until 20 March through Apple\u0027s special WWDC website. Developers will be told the day after applications close whether they have been successful in the ticket lottery that decides who gets tickets.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No deferral looks likely and the accompanying written ministerial statement refers to a consultation on the detailed design and implementation.”Large companies taking advantage of smaller ones by taking months to make payments will also face tougher rules. Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit committee of every large business, and to report back through the annual report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner.”Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on 29 March.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Police in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.Irish European affairs minister\u0026nbspHelen\u0026nbspMcEntee said the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was “appalling” that farmers have only just been given the\u0026nbspopportunity to see the tariff rates –\u0026nbspa fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller.

(Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power.

Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1418 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.1718 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

No deferral looks likely and the accompanying written ministerial statement refers to a consultation on the detailed design and implementation.”Large companies taking advantage of smaller ones by taking months to make payments will also face tougher rules. Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit committee of every large business, and to report back through the annual report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner.”Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on 29 March.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Police in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.Irish European affairs minister\u0026nbspHelen\u0026nbspMcEntee said the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was “appalling” that farmers have only just been given the\u0026nbspopportunity to see the tariff rates –\u0026nbspa fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Where new vehicles sold for use on British roads don’t conform to emissions standards, DVSA will work with other government agencies and manufacturers to ensure the vehicles are fixed as quickly as possible.”Concerns about vehicle emissions have grown since the Volkswagen diesel scandal emerged in September 2015.The German carmaker agreed to pay a €1bn (£880m) fine in Germany last year after it was revealed to have cheated tests on diesel engines in the US and Europe.In January, JLR announced it would cut 4,500 jobs to make £2.5bn of cost savings. The luxury carmaker blamed growing uncertainty about\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand slowing demand in China.The majority of those cuts are expected to be in the UK.Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The company said in a statement: “Jaguar Land Rover is conducting a voluntary recall following the identification of CO2 performance variability with certain Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles fitted with 2.0l diesel or petrol engines.“Affected vehicles will be repaired free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out.”Natalie\u0026nbspHitchins, head of home products and services at consumer group Which?, said: “Consumers must be able to fully trust the claims of car manufacturers, particularly after the emissions scandals of recent years.“Jaguar Land Rover must now act quickly to tell affected customers so that they can have their vehicles modified appropriately.”The issue was discovered by the Vehicle Certification Agency, a branch of the Department for Transport.Neil Barlow, head of vehicle engineering at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which administers the vehicle recall process, said: “DVSA’s priority is to protect everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles.“This includes vehicles that are damaging our environment. Where new vehicles sold for use on British roads don’t conform to emissions standards, DVSA will work with other government agencies and manufacturers to ensure the vehicles are fixed as quickly as possible.”Concerns about vehicle emissions have grown since the Volkswagen diesel scandal emerged in September 2015.The German carmaker agreed to pay a €1bn (£880m) fine in Germany last year after it was revealed to have cheated tests on diesel engines in the US and Europe.In January, JLR announced it would cut 4,500 jobs to make £2.5bn of cost savings. The luxury carmaker blamed growing uncertainty about\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand slowing demand in China.The majority of those cuts are expected to be in the UK.Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

A charity encouraging education through photography is trying to change that, writes Will WorleyClick to followThe Independent‘I look at this place in a new way,’ says Victor, 12There is little expensive technology flaunted on the streets of Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, often called the largest informal settlement in Africa.\u0026nbspSo it is a disorientating sight to see children gathering in the corner of a ramshackle bus terminal on the slum’s outskirts, clutching a disparate\u0026nbspcollection of flashy cameras, ranging from DSLRs to GoPros, as well as the occasional e-tablet.\u0026nbspThe children of this juxtaposed scene are students of the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, a local space dedicated to caring for some of the most disadvantaged children in Kibera. The cameras they hold have been donated by iniduals and manufacturers, and are distributed among the kids by Photostart, a growing charity that aims to teach children life skills through photography.Children living in Kibera – and other sub-Saharan African slums – grow up in an environment tough beyond the comprehension of most westerners. While there is some local praise for the area’s erse community and lively atmosphere, poverty runs deep and many people live on less than a pound a day. There are few services, infrastructure is dire and planning is almost non-existent, particularly in the poorest area known as “Chocolate City”, after its muddy paths.Kenyan youth in general face significant challenges. Only 32 per cent\u0026nbsphave finished secondary school or have some vocational training, and there is little prospect of stable work – only 5 per cent\u0026nbspof Kenyan youth were in formal employment last year, according to research by Well Told Story, a development communications group. Circumstances are even tougher for those from Kibera, who say they are often tarnished by their association with the area, which has a reputation for crime and political violence.\u0026nbspHow one Kenyan woman escaped FGM and saved thousands more from the cutBut when its youth are given the chance and resources to prove themselves, they flourish. Photostart students have achieved far beyond what their society expected of them, and their pictures have won awards, featured in exhibitions in Nairobi’s most important cultural centres, and even been placed in The\u0026nbspNew York Times.The children’s starting point at the bus terminal is testament to the scale of their achievements. The Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, run by Shosho Pascalia Nduku for 19 years, is the closest many of its 128 children have had to a formal education. But it has been constantly beset by financial problems, meaning Shosho struggles to pay teachers and maintain the building.She gives The Independent a tour of the dilapidated classrooms, where some of the children with no other home also sleep. “My wish is God will help me find a bigger place,” she sighs. Seven classes are crammed into just three small rooms. The paint is faded and the furniture falling apart, and in one the only light is provided by a plastic drinks bottle protruding through a hole in the corrugated metal ceiling.Shosho\u0026nbspPascalia\u0026nbspNduku\u0026nbsphas run the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre for 19 years\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)“The kids are so good,” she says. “But to pay the teachers is a tricky thing, so they are always changing and they cannot be stable.”\u0026nbspThe centre has no regular sponsorship and running it is a constant struggle for Shosho, but she says it is “a dream God gave me”. When she first began her work, she says, she would sometimes find children’s bodies in piles of rubbish in the street.\u0026nbspShe houses orphans, their parents taken by HIV, who sleep\u0026nbspon rags on the floor in the centre. Some of the children lack birth documentation and don’t even officially exist, demonstrating how far removed they are from mainstream society.\u0026nbsp“I have so many kids who don’t have ID, I don’t know what to do,” says Shosho, “I talked to the government about it, but they say they are waiting for reports.”Sometimes, children with families fare little better, and Shosho says she occasionally sees children who have been sexually abused by brothers or fathers. It doesn’t take long for her to spot them, she says: “They come in the next day with a changed face.”\u0026nbspSexual and gender-based violence is a key challenge facing the youth of Kibera, according to Thomas Bwire, a local journalist who runs a community news website and focuses on health. He says: “Rape can happen within the family or in the close community. Students are also vulnerable when they go to school.”Shosho has mostly run the centre alone for the two decades it has existed, though a volunteer, Ann, is preparing spinach and potatoes for the children’s lunch during The Independent’s visit. “The way a child is behaving, you can tell if they have eaten or not,” says Shosho. “When a child is hungry, they can be sick.” Malnutrition is also known to have an impact on a child’s development and particularly educational attainment.Created with Sketch.From Cairo to Cape Town: In and out of Africa with National Geographic Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A ghostly Nuba glee club bathes in ashes to ward off evil spirits before singing at a sanda festivalKenyans trudging along a road battle clouds of ﬂying locusts.

He says this has a poor impact on their physical development and mental health. “Kids still want to play, but often they do it in ditches where there is sewage,” Bwire adds.Photostart, founded by an American, David Lehman, aims to further the children’s abilities and belief in themselves. In addition to teaching the children to use digital cameras and tablets, it also schools them in organisational skills like data entry and digital asset management – thus grounding them with an education in technology that is not available to them in their normal schooling. “There’s not much theory, lots of it is practical,” he says.\u0026nbspLehman, 35, also highlights “soft skills” Photostart encourages in the kids, like planning, preparedness, expression and building their self-confidence. It’s also key that the children are taken off the street, something Lehman reckons Photostart has done for roughly 20,000 hours across their projects in Kenya and South Africa. “If they are on the streets they are with the gangs,” he says.\u0026nbspOutside the rescue centre, the children, aged around eight into the early teens, are ready to venture into the slum. The group must wait for two young men who provide an informal security presence – their equipment is, after all, a valuable commodity.Photostart, a charity aiming to teach children life skills through photography\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)On their arrival, the children rapidly take to the streets with their cameras. Shosho, who has no classes today, joins the group as they make their way through the dust-red maze of paths that make up Kibera. As they leave their everyday lives behind them, the children’s spirits rise and excitedly, then more methodically, their view of their everyday environment alters as they document it through a lens.Dr Gil Pasternak, reader in social and political photographic cultures at De Montfort University, says photography encourages its practitioners to acquire a fresh perspective as it compels to\u0026nbspthem to go out into a new environment. “They need to make decisions: what to photograph, what angle to use, how to frame it, what to include, what to exclude,” he says.\u0026nbspThere are other benefits too. “The process of going out with camera can potentially make them aware of ersity and complexity,” Pasternak adds. “It can lead them to understand that information can be delivered in different ways and can also be manipulated.”He says this may help some children develop their critical thinking and lead them to question what is given to them as objective information and to explore further, possibly “developing their curiosity more broadly”.Lehman guides the children on the walkabout, pointing out when someone’s elbow is in the frame, or why the shutter won’t close (the timer’s on). “You can see progress in their work, especially older kids,” he says.\u0026nbspAs the children move deeper into Kibera, stray dogs, slumbering in the afternoon sun, suddenly find themselves models for an impromptu photo shoot. An open rubbish pit, smouldering and noxious, becomes the backdrop for portraits of friends posing together. Next to it lies the railway track which cuts through the slum as it links the coastal city of Mombasa to Uganda, and a view of Kibera’s expanse opens up.\u0026nbspThis railway was where Kibera began, when the British colonial government granted ethnic Nubian soldiers who served the empire land next to the tracks in the early 20th century. It used to be a wooded area – the name comes from the Nubian “Kibra”, meaning “forest”. The slum grew as more people, of all ethnic groups, migrated to the city, and the railway sustained economic activity.Inua Mimi Rescue Centre in Nairobi (Will Worley)But despite being a gateway to Nairobi for many Kenyans, Kibera has gained a reputation for political violence, which emerged along ethnic lines after elections in 2007. Election-related violence also swept through the slum in the aftermath of a disputed poll in 2017, and left its mark on the children living there.“The election was a challenge, people liked to fight,” says\u0026nbsp14-year-old orphan Abrut Wakesa, of the bloodshed, which led to the deaths of dozens people.Children often witnessed violence during this period and sometimes even subjected to it, according to Bwire, leaving them vulnerable to mental health problems. “But there are no trauma centres or counselling,” he says. “People can’t share what they saw. They are left to heal on their own.”As the children continue on their walkabout through the winding alleys and open sewage of Chocolate City, they become more animated. Objects of visual excitement, like a lone white rabbit which cautiously emerges from behind a fence, prompts a flurry of shutters.Shosho, who an hour before seemed to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders, laughs in between playing with a DSLR.“My heart is shining, I am the happiest woman,” she beams. “My kids really need this. They are the poorest of the poor.”Lehman says that an important part of the walkabouts he organises – with different groups across Nairobi – is to get the children “out of their heads and classrooms” for a little while, and to forget about their troubles.“Kids who were very shy, we now see brightness in them when we do this,” he says.Pasternak says the simple practice of being out with a camera may be conducive to improving confidence and other attributes in young photographers.\u0026nbsp“Being in a new environment, they will meet people out there, which means the photographer can learn about different perspectives, different values and different types of behaviours,” he says. “They might have not encountered these elsewhere.”\u0026nbspPasternak continues: “Encountering a range of iniduals and personalities can compel some children to learn how to talk with different types of people.\u0026nbsp“It can help them develop their expression skills and it can consequently help them develop new vocabulary, both verbal and emotional.”Pasternak adds that meeting new people and learning how best to deal with them can also “encourage them to empathise better and help them understand that not everybody is the same”.\u0026nbsp“All of these are transferable skills they can take to other areas in life,” he says.\u0026nbspWe ignore Islamist terrorism in Africa at our peril‘The city is very quiet’: Nairobi left reeling after latest attackCanadian among six suspects in court over Nairobi hotel attackNairobi attack a grim reminder of spectre of terrorism over KenyaThe “harder”\u0026nbspskills, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet, are turned into lessons that are “most assuredly shared with friend, neighbour or stranger”, says Lehman. Each walkabout is followed by a debrief, and older children often take responsibility for training younger students.\u0026nbspWhile the student’s pictures have been widely recognised within Kenya, perhaps their most valuable achievement is taking it upon themselves to share the benefits of their experiences.“Knowledge spreads fast,” Lehman says. “These students are anything but selfish about learning, they make sure their peers are keeping up, and relish showing off how much they have learned.”Locals have received the project well, and hope that it will both benefit more of their children and give the area a voice.“It’s a good platform for kids to do something different and a change in activity from the classroom,” says Jaymosh, a Kibera resident who works with another charity operating in the area. “There are a lot of untold stories in the slum.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The assembly calls on Khan to do “an urgent updating of his carbon reduction targets to make London carbon neutral by 2030”. It is only eleven years to 2030 and transport is Britain’s largest source of greenhouse gas\u0026nbsppollution. There is no time to wait for new technologies to be developed and proven in service.London is already introducing electric buses that charge when stopped, but only on the least demanding routes. The biggest benefits for climate and regional air quality come from switching the longest, fastest and busiest routes to electricity. The good news is that battery trolleybuses are ready to replace diesel buses. Battery trolleybus technology is well proven the system in Rome\u0026nbsphas been in operation since 2005.It is tempting to think that a climate emergency program could see large numbers of new tram lines built quickly. However, most urban roads cover an array of pipes carrying water, sewage, gas, and storm water that have to be accessible for maintenance and repair. (Tearing up tracks every time an underground pipe springs a leak is not much of an option.)It can be very expensive and disruptive to relocate pipes so tram tracks can be built. It is not just the financial cost that needs to be considered, digging up and replacing pipes, and laying heavy concrete beds for steel rails creates pollution. This is where battery trolleybuses could be a game changer. Not only are they cheaper and quicker to introduce, they only need overhead power infrastructure on a fraction of the route.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Car traffic quickly expands to fill expanded road space in urban areas. And the opposite is also true when you make a car lane into a bus lane traffic disappears. And traffic speeds don’t usually change much. In her 1961 classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs wrote about how after the road through Washington Square Park in New York was closed to make it a safer and more pleasant space “cars – just disappeared into thin air”. Traffic did not increase on the surrounding streets as many had predicted. Many similar experiences of disappearing traffic have been documented.Any serious climate action plan must include measures to reduce car travel. And one of the most effective ways to cut vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is to re-allocate road space to anything other than vehicle travel or parking. Creating pedestrian streets, protected bike lanes, tram lines, or bus lanes all reduce VMT and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution. But bus lanes for electric buses are an obvious choice in a climate emergency. A well designed bus lane can carry ten times as many people as a lane of cars, and make many polluting automobiles disappear, for a very modest cost.Modern trams are long vehicles with two or more articulated sections. Most of the buses used in bus rapid transit (BRT) lines are similarly articulated or double articulated “bendy buses”\u0026nbspwith capacities of up to 220 people. Double-decker buses, and standard buses, are also used on some BRT lines. New battery trolleybus lines are also being installed for BRT lines. Bus rapid transit utilises bus lanes, typically in the centre of the road, and other features to make bus service faster and more convenient. I recently test rode the BRT line in Castellon, Spain, which is about ten years old. The quiet electric buses run connected to overhead trolley wires on a car-free bus lanes for much of the route, but run off-wire through Castellon’s charming historical centre. A new battery trolleybus BRT line will open in Rimini, Italy later this year.Mayors call for £1.5 billion fund to remove polluting vehicles from UKCities expanding their use of battery trolleybuses include Zurich, Switzerland, which is also expanding its very extensive network of bus lanes – some of which meet BRT standards. After the 1973 oil shock, Zurich\u0026nbspcreated a still unmatched network of exclusive transit lanes and signal priority for both trams and buses. Zurich is building new bus lanes, and improving older ones to get closer to its goal of never having transit passengers delayed by cars. Zurich now has the highest transit ridership in Europe, largely created with cans of paint and cleverly applied electronics controlling traffic lights. And traffic congestion is less of a problem than in most European cities.The climate emergency is far more serious than the oil supply crisis of the 1970s was, and cities like London must more than match Zurich’s past efforts. Lyon, France, is also an interesting example. In recent years Lyon has built and upgraded bus lanes and BRT lines, added trolley wires to new routes, and upgraded to battery trolleybuses with considerable off-wire capabilities. Lyon’s BRT and tram lines complement the metro network in the urban centre, and serve outlying areas that don’t have metro lines.Trolleybus BRT lines are not isolated to Europe. Two of the three BRT lines in Beijing, China, have been converted to operate with battery trolleybuses. And San Francisco is constructing a BRT corridor on an existing trolleybus line. The oldest trolleybus BRT line has been carrying heavy passenger loads since 1995, in Quito, Ecuador. The capacity of BRT lines is similar to tram lines, even though the vehicles tend to be smaller a line with 200 passenger buses arriving every six minutes has more capacity than a line with 300 passenger trams every ten minutes. Since BRT lines are less expensive and quicker to build than other forms of rapid transit, electric BRT is a crucial climate solution – we are in a climate emergency and humanity is running out of time.Electricity is the only energy source up to the jobIn the climate emergency, it is essential to know what really works at the necessary scale. The London mayor’s office touts hydrogen to power buses. Hydrogen cars, trucks and buses have been held up as a solution to the range limitations of battery electric vehicles for decades. But repeated tests of hydrogen transit buses have been dead ends. In my part of the world, the hydrogen bus trial in Whistler, Canada, saw the buses sold off at scrap value after only five years. Moreover, much of the present hydrogen supply is created from natural gas, and the carbon dioxide pollution is released into the atmosphere.Creating hydrogen from renewable electricity is much less efficient and more expensive than using the same electricity in battery trolleybuses, and liquid fuels created by combining hydrogen and carbon are even less efficient. For lighter duty routes, efficient battery buses with stationary charging work fine. A recent report from the Brussels-based Transport \u0026amp Environment (T\u0026ampE) research group, How to decarbonise European transport by 2050, states that: “Given the much lower efficiencies of hydrogen but in particular electrofuels, these are optimally used only where no other alternatives exists.” This report calculates that hydrogen buses use 2.6 times as much energy as battery electric buses. T\u0026ampE’s 2018 report Electric buses arrive on time concludes that “trolley buses with batteries or fast charging e-buses are the preferred solution to address range limitations”.The mayor’s office also promotes biodiesel from waste materials. The supply of truly climate-friendly biodiesel (made from contaminated vegetable oil skimmed from sewer grease traps and the like) is tiny compared to the demand for diesel fuel. Much of the present biodiesel supply comes from food crops, and is more dangerous to climatic stability than conventional oil. And burning food when climate chaos is starting to disrupt agriculture does not seem like a bright idea.Biomethane made from waste organic material can be burnt in natural gas buses. But like biodiesel the climate friendly sources of organic material are extremely limited. Your kitchen scraps and left over chips don’t produce much biomethane. The limited quantities of biomethane are best used to displace fossil natural gas in uses such as restaurant kitchens. Renewable electricity from wind, solar and other sources is rapidly becoming less expensive – and it can be scaled up quickly. Transport for London is already working to purchase renewable electricity and expand renewable generation in the UK. Biodiesel and biomethane are also not much better for air quality than conventional diesel. Acting on the climate emergency can produce much cleaner air with a switch to electricity.Local air pollution causes thousands of premature deaths every year in the UK, as well as contributing to widespread chronic illness in adults and children. All fossil fuel vehicles are more polluting than the manufacturers claim, not just Volkswagen’s diesel machines, though accurate data is tough to come by. Cars, trucks and buses are the most dangerous sources of air pollution since exhaust fumes are released directly onto streets full of people.A few thousand deaths a year pales in comparison to the climate emergency, which threatens the futures of every younger person on the planet. But cleaner air is an important co-benefit of climate action. T\u0026ampE calculates that when noise and air pollution costs are included, electric buses cost about the same as fossil fuel buses. When climate pollution is included, electric buses and bus lanes are a grand bargain.Electric buses for busiest routesBattery trolleybuses charge their batteries off overhead trolley wires while moving, and operate like other battery electric buses off-wire, and can cover at least the same distance in a day as a diesel bus. And the overhead wires only need to cover between one-fifth and two-thirds of the route, so costs are not much more than burning diesel. Modern trolleybus poles connect and disconnect from the wires with a driver operated switch. Reconnecting is done at stops with plastic “rooftops” to guide the connector onto the wire. If the driver has to lower the poles to go around construction, the driver just goes to the next stop that is equipped with “rooftops” and flicks a switch to reconnect.Many more, and better, bus lanes will be needed to meet the aspirations of the climate emergency declaration. A bus crawling along in traffic, or in a so-called bus lane jammed with taxis, does not use much energy. A bus using good quality transit lanes covers much more distance, will attract many more passengers, and will therefore use much more energy. I attended the 6th\u0026nbspinternational e-bus conference in Solingen, Germany, in November and heard how the cities in the best position to quickly shift to electric buses on energy intensive routes are those that already have trolleybus wires in place. “It’s a no brainer\u0026nbsp... To use electric buses which are powered with in motion charging,” said Erik Lenz of Kiepe Electric.Solingen’s transit agency has stopped ordering fossil fuel buses and is using their existing trolley wire network to charge battery trolleybuses. “It is a very efficient system, and that’s why they went for it,” said Lenz. Solingen is aiming for 80 per cent electric buses within four years, and will phase out burning fossil fuels as older buses are replaced. Cities with existing trolleybus wire networks (such as Lyon Vancouver Seattle San Francisco Shanghai Beijing and over 300 other cities around the world) already have powerful charging systems in place for electric buses.Unfortunately, no UK cities kept their trolley bus systems. London and other UK cities switched from electric buses to “modern” diesel buses, and removed their extensive trolley wire networks in the 1950s and 1960s. However, installing new trolley wires to create charging roads is not necessarily more expensive than installing many charging stations for the same number of buses. If the climate emergency declaration is taken seriously, there will be a major investment in charging infrastructure of some kind.Some cities are bringing the trolleybus back. For example Verona, Italy, closed its trolleybus system in 1975 it will have two new battery trolleybus lines in operation by 2021, with off-wire operation in the city centre. Experts from cities such as Berlin and Stockholm told the e-bus conference that different types of electric bus charging systems are required for different transit lines. Overnight charging works for smaller buses that don’t travel far per day. Electric buses that stop and charge at fast chargers can have a role on moderately demanding lines. But the heavy lifting is best done by battery electric trolleybuses, which are the most practical technology for large buses on the busiest and most demanding routes.London council accused of putting ‘lives at risk’ over air pollutionHigh air pollution alert issued for London, Scotland and YorkshireAir pollution puts city residents in bad mood, study suggestsBattery trolleybuses can accelerate and climb hills faster than equivalent diesel buses, so on hilly routes they can be significantly faster. Using other types of electric buses on the most demanding routes would require buying and operating more buses, with each bus driving a shorter distance per day. With larger buses even the most powerful fast chargers often take longer than the time available at end points. This would be impractically expensive in large cities where land to park and charge buses is not readily available.In small cities, larger fleets of electric buses using stationary charging may be a reasonable choice. Regardless of the charging system chosen, the investment needed to switch to electric buses will be considerable. The UK’s contracting system for buses will have to be eliminated or radically changed to make this investment in charging infrastructure possible – private companies are not going to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in charging systems if their contract is up in five years. Letting Margaret Thatcher block climate action from the grave would be a very sad joke.Cities that use a lot of double-decker buses, such as Berlin and London, face an extra challenge in electrifying their fleets. Large double-decker buses weigh a lot when full, and don’t have as many tyres as an equivalent bendy bus. Adding large batteries would cause costly damage to roads, and it may be challenging to fit large batteries into existing bus designs.A promising solution is to add trolley poles to an existing double-decker bus design to allow usage on the most demanding routes if the batteries can be charged while the bus is in motion the batteries can be smaller and lighter. Most historic UK trolleybuses were double-deckers, and there is no obvious obstacle to adding modern trolley poles to a modern electric double-decker bus. On very busy routes, the better option may be to switch to double articulated buses that can carry up to 220 people.Everyone knows that companies make exaggerated claims about their products. Electric bus manufacturers routinely base their claims for how far their electric buses can go between charges on ideal conditions. But real world performance with heavy passenger loads and power-hungry heat or air conditioning operating is a different matter. Unfortunately, the world’s largest manufacturer of electric buses has been reportedly beset by “poor performance” including driving ranges that fall short of company claims in the US, leading disappointed transit agencies to delay the transition off fossil fuels. But transit agencies everywhere can learn from European experience with what each type of electric bus can really do.With battery trolleybuses there is no need to wait around for the battery industry to make improbable technical leaps – while batteries getting cheaper they are still very heavy, and weight will likely still be a big issue a decade from now. T\u0026ampE’s electric bus report suggests increasing the allowable weight for electric buses so they can carry as many passengers as diesel buses. This is reasonable, but the cost of repairing damaged roads needs to be considered when comparing lighter battery trolleybuses to heavier electric buses with larger battery packs.Prices will come downBattery electric buses and battery trolleybuses are now becoming variations of the same product – and prices will come down as a result. Electrical equipment manufacturers ABB and Kiepe Electric both told the e-bus conference participants about how they use the same components in battery electric buses that charge only while stopped, and buses equipped with trolley poles. This means that as the volume of electric buses goes up, prices of all types of electric buses will come down with economies of scale.Trolley:motion, which is funded by the European Union, organised the e-bus conference. Their mission includes improving battery trolleybus technology, and bringing prices down by expanding the number of manufacturers offering trolley charging on their electric buses. Soon, Trolley:motion will be assisting with the conversion of an ordinary battery electric bus to a battery trolleybus capable of operating all day on very demanding routes. If this goes as expected, most bus manufactures should soon offer trolley poles as an option on their electric buses.If big cities, such as Berlin and London, step up and order thousands of battery trolleybuses it will bring prices down globally as the scale of production jumps to a new level. All major bus manufacturers are capable of producing battery trolleybuses, and will respond to demand from big customers. At the United Nations COP 24 climate conference in December, teenage school climate strike organiser Greta Thunberg demanded that adults start taking the climate emergency seriously\u0026nbsp“because we are facing an existential threat and there is no time to continue down this road of madness”.

sheets across Greenland and Antarctica.At the point where two plates collide, they create mountain ranges containing “sutures” – clear fault lines containing newly exposed rock.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology realised the emergence of sutures over the course of millennia coincided with the onset of each major ice age.Giant fish washed up dead in Japan raise fear of earthquake or tsunamiThey also found that while some sutures, such as the one located in the Himalayas, had over time moved away from the equator, each one had its origins in the tropics.“We found that every time there was a peak in the suture zone in the tropics, there was a glaciation event,” said Dr Oliver Jagoutz, a geologist at MIT who led the study.“So every time you get, say, 10,000km of sutures in the tropics, you get an ice age.”While the reaction of substances like calcium and magnesium in the rocks with CO2 was the starting point for global cooling, it has also had a role in ending each ice age.Once all the rock that was available to react with the CO2 had been weathered away, it could no longer store any more climate-warming gas, leading to temperatures rising.Despite the planet currently experiencing a relatively icy period, global temperatures are rising as human activity pumps huge volumes of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.While employing the planet’s geology to somehow reverse this process seems like an appealing idea, Dr Jagoutz said it is unlikely to be much help.“The Earth does this in a slow, geological process that has nothing to do with what we do to the Earth today. And it will neither harm us, nor save us,” he said.These results were published in the journal Science.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.The complaints about the date are relatively obvious. Most places around the world use a different system to the US, where Pi Day was born.There’s no such thing as ‘Pie Week’ in Wigan – it’s always pie weekBy far the most popular date format is daymonthyear, as is used in the UK as well as much of Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. It is not\u0026nbsppossible to write Pi day using that format, but it is easy to write Pi approximation day.In China and many other countries in south-east Asia, dates are written yearmonthday. It is possible to do Pi day in that format since the day (14) does follow the month (3), but the year comes first and throws that off slightly.But the complaints about the competitor to Pi Day, Tau Day, are much more aggressive – and campaigners for the change have made a website and a full manifesto, laying out exactly why the world is wrong.That manifesto, written by Tau fan Michael Hartl, is dedicated to the “true circle constant”, which he says should be referred to by the Greek letter Tau.The number itself is simply Pi, but doubled – 6.28318, and so on. That makes it easier to use in many applications, campaigners claim.But those behind the Tau manifesto admit that they are facing a difficult challenge: “a powerful conspiracy, centuries old, determined to propagate pro-Pi propaganda”.But they hope that they can prove that Pi “is a confusing and unnatural choice for the circle constant”, they say, even if the name of the constant and its day doesn’t actually change.To settle the argument, some people have taken to celebrating a specific “Tau time” on Pi day – 6.28pm. That is when, for instance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sends out its admissions decisions over the internet, which was\u0026nbspa change made to welcome Tau into the celebrations.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The animal, which died when it was about seven-years-old, is one of the best preserved mammoths known to science. The team extracted tissue samples from the animal’s bone marrow and muscle, which they described as “well preserved”. They then began searching for cell nuclei remains. In total, 88 nucleus-like structures were collected from the muscle sample.Created with Sketch.Woolly mammoth found in Siberia to be displayed in Tokyo Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A 39,000-year-old female woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia arrives at an exhibition hall in Yokohama, south of TokyoThe snout of a 39,000-year-old female Woolly mammoth, which was found frozen in Siberia, Russia.

The team said following the procedure a “pronucleus-like structure budded from the injected … mammoth nucleus”.They also found possible signs of repair to damaged mammoth DNA.Despite the successes, the scientists did not observe the further cell ision necessary to create a viable egg, “possibly due to the extensive DNA damage in the transferred nuclei”.This marks a “significant step toward bringing mammoths back from the dead”, researcher Kei Miyamoto, one of the study’s authors told Japan’s Nikkei news outlet.“We want to move our study forward to the stage of cell ision,” he added, but acknowledged “we still have a long way to go”.Woolly mammoth DNA found in illegal ivory samples seized in CambodiaLast woolly mammoths on Earth ‘killed off by lack of water’Farmer digs up 15,000-year-old woolly mammoth in fieldMost mammoth populations died out between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk\u0026nbsppeninsula of Siberia until 9,650 years ago.But the species survived for another 5,000 years on Siberian islands, which became cut off from the mainland by retreating ice following the last ice age. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago – well beyond the dawn of human civilisation, but finally becoming extinct around the time of the construction of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. There is no scientific consensus on the chief cause for the creatures’ demise, but climate change significantly reduced habitable parts of the globe for mammoths, and they were also hunted by humans.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.Will can then be seen for the rest of the clip attempting to adjust to his new home.Cooper said on social media that more than 100 people worked on the trailer, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes.The trailer has been watched more than a million times on YouTube.\u0026nbspThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u0026nbsporiginally aired from 1990 to 1996 and retains a strong fan base to this day.The Fresh Prince of Bel-AirThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During the 2016 Brexit referendum, the countryside was seemingly covered in huge billboards, presumably placed there by farmers and landowners, urging a Leave vote.And yet now, as the outraged response from the National Farmers’ Union makes clear, agriculture seems set to be one of the biggest losers from Brexit, especially under the no-deal\u0026nbspscenario currently\u0026nbspunder discussion.Their fear, if not their earlier voting record, is easily explained.On the one hand, much of British farming is protected by the European Union’s common external tariff regime. This is basically an import tax on products such as meat, dairy products, cereals and sugar from the rest of the world, ranging up to almost 40 per cent. It has helped such business survive and prosper, in some cases, and helps to fund the common agricultural policy. From there the money is used to support farm prices and incomes. (Not all types of produce are inside the CAP: for example, apples, cabbages and carrots are excluded.)\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch. highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote  highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Take those EU tariffs away, or reduce them, and those who make their livelihood from, say, wheat crops, will find themselves squeezed or perhaps driven out of business by overseas competition. Cheaper products from the rest of the world – Australia, Argentina, Africa, the US – would soon undercut the British equivalents, leading to lost orders, lower prices, redundancies and bankruptcies.Brands such as Weetabix or McVitie’s can source ingredients such as sugar and grain just as easily from America as, say, East Anglia. Partial government promises about future farming financial support are only of limited comfort – those subsidies may not exist for ever.Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no-deal condemned as ‘madness’On the other side, if the EU were to maintain its existing tariffs and then slap them on British agricultural exports, farmers would find themselves effectively locked out of their close European markets. The EU might also implement costly and time-consuming customs checks on perishable goods and live exports, and require certification under “rules of origin” for the likes of confectionery and frozen meals.Everything from Scottish salmon and Welsh oysters to English beef and frozen cod pie would be badly hit in such conditions.\u0026nbspSo hard Brexit\u0026nbspwould be a colossal double whammy, impoverishing already vulnerable countryside industries in a way not seen since the depression of the early 1930s. For an economist, the argument is a classic example of the consumer interest (cheaper food bought at the lowest possible prices on world markets) being set against the producer interest (maintaining farming incomes).Either way, it is probably not tactful or helpful to remind people in our rural communities that many of them voted for Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

In it he quotes the authority on parliamentary procedure, Erskine May: “A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.”The problem is that, as Captain Barbossa explained when Keira Knightley tried to appeal to the pirate code in the\u0026nbspPirates of the Caribbean sequel, “the code is more what you’d call guidelines than actual rules”.\u0026nbspHow do you define a change “in substance”? Theresa May had a reasonable case on Tuesday, when she asked the Commons to vote again on her Brexit deal. The withdrawal agreement and the political declaration were the same documents that had been rejected by a record 230-vote margin in January, but this time they had new documents attached.\u0026nbspThe opinion of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, was that “the joint instrument and the declaration provide a substantive and binding reinforcement of the legal rights available to the UK”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch. highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote  highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote That argument might be a bit thinner next week, but the government will produce new documents and possibly new legal advice from Cox, so it will argue that MPs are once more\u0026nbspvoting on a new proposition.\u0026nbspIt would then be up to John Bercow, the speaker, to rule as to whether or not it was “in order” for the government to seek another vote. Bercow’s independence of the government is well known, and has caused friction, but I do not believe he would rule against the prime minister on a question as important as this.\u0026nbspThere are two other principles in Erskine May that might influence him. One is that his rulings should help the Commons to reach a decision. The other is that it is for MPs themselves to decide in difficult cases.\u0026nbspIn the end Chris Bryant didn’t press the amendment to a vote because he knew it would lose.\u0026nbspIf MPs as a whole do not agree with him that the prime minister should be banned from putting her deal to another vote, then that is what our sovereign House of Commons has decided.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Welsh secretary Alun Cairns abstained.Parliament chose to reject that deal. So we now have to confront the difficult position that decisions taken by parliament have left us inA further 27 junior ministers and 11 whips also voted against the approach Ms May is taking, including the outspoken Conservative deputy chairman James Cleverly and other Brexit ministers Kwasi Kwarteng and Chris Heaton-Harris. Three other whips, including chief Julian Smith, declined to vote.A Downing Street spokesman sought to play down the splits in the cabinet and wider party, pointing out that the prime minister had granted them a free vote so it was normal that they could chose to act they wished.He went on to point the finger of blame squarely at the Commons, when discussing why the delay was necessary: “The prime minister absolutely wanted and strived for the United Kingdom to be leaving the EU on 29 March.“Everything she has done since she came to office was intended to deliver that. She did not want there to be an extension. She brought forward a meaningful vote twice having agreed a deal with the EU in November.MPs reject a second Brexit referendum“Parliament chose to reject that deal. So we now have to confront the difficult position that decisions taken by parliament have left us in.”Earlier in the day, tensions peaked when Ms May sat at the cabinet table to discuss events the night before, when remainer cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Mundell rebelled against her orders that they should oppose a plan to strongly rule out a no-deal Brexit.UK to ask EU for Brexit delay until at least JuneClimate change, not Brexit, is the biggest threat to our countryReports suggested that Mr Smith attacked the remainers, and then stormed out when business secretary Mr Clark tried to explain himself.Following the bust up, Ms May agreed to allow a free vote on Thursday’s motion on delaying Brexit in an apparent attempt to keep Brexiteer ministers happy and avoid a damaging split.In other votes on Thursday, the prime minister’s Conservative MPs did follow orders allowing her to successfully block opposition proposals that would have allowed parliament to seize control of Brexit and decide what to do next.The result confirms that Ms May will now try to win a third vote on her Brexit deal, after it was defeated by 149 votes on Tuesday and 230 votes earlier in the year.The Independent understands that Ms May will likely schedule the vote for Tuesday next week, allowing her a few days to try to convince the DUP and Eurosceptic Tories to back it.Discussion with the DUP were set to continue through the weekend, with the party’s leader Arlene Foster said to have not yet bought her ticket back to Belfast.She said: “We are talking to the government and to the attorney general at the moment to try and make a deal happen because we want to see Brexit working, we want to see it working for the whole of the UK in a way that doesn’t leave Northern Ireland behind.”The prospect of a lengthy delay to Brexit had also prompted some Tories to admit that they might now back Ms May’s deal.Conor Burns, a close ally of Boris Johnson, said: “I am now looking for a reason to support it. The pretence that this parliament has honoured this referendum result is now slipping away.Another, Lucy Allan, wrote on Twitter: “Last night, Labour MPs together with a handful of hardcore Conservatives voted to take no deal off the table. So now we will not be leaving the EU on 29 March…and they cheered.“Now the option we are faced with is Theresa May’s deal or no Brexit.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Any extension will need to be approved by all 27 EU member states.The government has said that if a Brexit deal is agreed by MPs by 20 March, it will seek a delay until 30 June.But if no withdrawal agreement is in place by that date, the extension is likely to be much longer - possibly up to two years.\u0026nbspNo10\u0026nbsphopes the deadline will convince Eurosceptic Tory rebels to step into line, knowing that failure to back the prime minister\u0027s plan is likely to lead to a lengthy delay to Brexit.\u0026nbspBefore approving the government\u0027s motion, the Commons narrowly rejected an alternative plan, proposed by a cross-party group of senior backbenchers, that called for the\u0026nbspdelay to Brexit to be used to find a way forward that can command majority support. The proposal would have seen a series of indicative votes held to establish what sort of Brexit deal MPs might support. In a bid to see off the amendment, ministers promised to hold a series of similar votes if Ms May\u0027s deal is rejected again\u0026nbspnext week.MPs also voted down an Independent Group amendment that would have triggered another referendum.The government motion passed by MPs\u0026nbspsaid the Commons notes the resolutions of the House of 12 and 13 March, and accordingly agrees the government will seek to agree with the European Union an extension of the period specified in Article 50.Pressure will now be piled on Eurosceptic Tories, who have twice\u0026nbspvoted down Ms May\u0027s exit plan, to finally back it in order to avoid a long delay to Brexit.\u0026nbspThe prime minister had given Tory MPs a free vote on\u0026nbspthe Article 50 motion in order to avoid any of her ided cabinet ministers having to resign. That allowed several senior members of her government to vote\u0026nbspher motion, including Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, defence secretary Gavin Williamson and international development secretary Penny Morduant.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMs May will now ask the EU for an extension to the Article 50 period, most likely at a summit in Brussels at the end of next week.Before then, she is expected to hold a third vote on her withdrawal agreement in a last-gasp bid to persuade MPs to approve it.

She had agreed to allow her MPs a free vote on that motion in order to let her ided cabinet ministers vote as they pleased without having to resign.Her hand was forced, however, when backbenchers put forward an amendment calling for a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out at any stage - not just on 29 March.\u0026nbspLabour abandons support for referendum on May\u0027s Brexit dealThat motion narrowly passed, despite the government whipping its MPs to vote against it.The amended motion was then put to another\u0026nbspvote, with Ms May forced into the farcical\u0026nbspsituation of ordering her MPs\u0026nbspto oppose the\u0026nbspmotion - now amended - that she herself had put forward.\u0026nbspBut her efforts were in vain, as MPs backed the proposal by 321 votes to 278 - a majority of 43.Four cabinet ministers - Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Mundell - and a handful of junior ministers\u0026nbspignored party orders to vote against the motion and instead\u0026nbspabstained, raising the prospect of them being\u0026nbspsacked.During another evening of dramatic votes in the Commons, MPs also comprehensively rejected a proposal that would have seen the UK leave the EU without an exit deal on 22 May.\u0026nbspSpeaking immediately after suffering her latest Commons setback,\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbspsaid the government would now bring forward a motion, to be voted on tomorrow,\u0026nbspproposing an extension to the\u0026nbspArticle 50 process.The motion says that if the Commons passes a Brexit deal by 20 March, Brexit will be delayed until the end of June. If no deal is agreed by 20 March, however, the motion suggests that a much longer extension is likely to follow.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass815 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMs May\u0026nbsptold the Commons: If the House finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to Article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU.But let me be clear: such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place.She continued: Therefore, the House has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to Article 50.\u0026nbsp Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019.I do not think that would be the right outcome, but the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

If they did, we wouldn’t be in this mess.Some Remainer MPs will back Mrs May’s deal, knowing it’s doomed. It will be their last remotely pro-Brexit act.Once they see Leave MPs pass up perhaps their last chance to secure our exit they will pretend they have done their best by the .million majority and set about defying their will more openly.We wish it were otherwise, but voting down the deal doesn’t lead to No Deal.It leads to Mrs May begging the EU for help which it will not supply because it wants Brexit reversed at any cost.It leads to the panicked postponement of Article , then the softest possible Brexit — unrecognisable to Leavers — or a second referendum the Establishment will do its utmost to skew for Remain.It leads to the upending of our democracy, the possible collapse of the Tory party and the world’s fth biggest economy then being handed over to Marxists and Communists who loathe the West and back anti-Semitic terrorists.Such mayhem should petry everyone. But especially Leave-backing Tories.Yet they are poised to reject a deal which, while very far from perfect, they would have gladly taken had it been offered up before the  referendum.They must think again.ONE thing unites many of Corbyn’s top team: they are rolling in inherited wealth.Take Laura Murray, one of the few self-styled enemies of “the bourgeoisie” who is descended from aristocracy and whose mother sold a Picasso for £million.Or millionaire Seumas Milne, whose papa ran the BBC and sent him to one of Britain’s priciest public schools.Or Corbyn himself, raised in a country manor and sent to prep school.Never having experienced poverty, these super-rich poseurs consider it romantic and noble rather than a trap to be escaped through opportunity.Their failed ideology would turn that poverty into squalor and early graves.But what would these phoney class warriors care  It will never touch them.WE welcome Sajid Javid stripping more terrorist brides of UK citizenship.They deserve nothing from the country they and their genocidal IS husbands swore to overthrow.

But Remainers, like Nick Boles and Amber Rudd, also need to wake up to how their party has changed. It is not the Cameron outfit of three years ago. Brexit has changed it, for the time being at least.The Tories are polling a healthy  per cent only because of Leave voters. They are the Leave party. No one knows what Labour is — that’s partly why its ratings are in freefall.So it will be fatal to the Toriesthey betray .million voters by failing to secure Brexit on or around March  — and preside over a delay long enough to enable Boles’s unsustainable Norway- Plus sham, or even a new referendum.In a snap election millions of Leavers or natural Tories would never vote for Corbyn. Instead they would stay at home or maybe opt for Nigel Farage’s new party once it emerges.  Either will annihilate the Tories and put Corbyn in power.Theresa May’s Brexit deal is not as good as the Government claims, nor quite as bad as its detractors believe. Most Leavers vastly prefer No Deal and fair enough. We just do not believe they will ever get it. Remainers will do anything to prevent it.Mrs May’s deal gets Brexit over the line, as Michael Gove argues.  It avoids a far, far softer one.  It kills off a second referendum. And the future is then up for grabs.We greatly admire Tory backbenchers who have stuck to the Brexit promises on which they were elected. Buttoday they still cannot swallow their pride, hold their noses and back this deal, we fear the consequences.Their party may well pay a terrible price — and the country with it.THE best way to prevent morons invading football pitches and punching players is to make them a hate figure in the stands.Some idiots at Birmingham City cheered and clapped Paul Mitchell as he was escorted away after his sickening assault on Villa’s Jack Grealish.

But given how much the web has changed in the past  years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next .If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.To tackle any problem, we must clearly outline and understand it. I broadly see three sources of dys affecting today’s web:The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that changes incentives.And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right we will need to come together as a global web community.At pivotal moments, generations before us have stepped up to work together for a better future. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, erse groups of people have been able to agree on essential principles.With the Law of the Sea and the Outer Space Treaty, we have preserved new frontiers for the common good.Now too, as the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good. This is why the Web Foundation is working with governments, companies and citizens to build a new Contract for the Web.This contract was launched in Lisbon, Portugal, at Web Summit, bringing together a group of people who agree we need to establish clear norms, laws and standards that underpin the web.Those who support it endorse its starting principles and together are working out the specic commit-ments in each area.No one group should do this alone, and all input will be appreciated. Governments, companies and citizens are all contributing, and we aim to have a result later this year.Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.We need open web champions within government — civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientic fact or public safety.Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind. This year we’ve seen a number of tech employees stand up and demand better business practices. We need to encourage that spirit.And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web,we don’t do our part to foster constructive, healthy conversations online,we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity.The Contract for the Web must not be a list of quick fixes but a process that signals a sht in how we understand our relationship with our online community.It must be clear enough to act as a guiding star for the way forward but flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change in technology.It’s our journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive future.The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. Butwe dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The country needs a new head of government before we all plunge our heads in the nearest khazi.It was bad luck that Mrs May should succumb to late winter lurgy and lose her voice this critical week at Westminster, just when she needed it most. But in politics, and le, luck sticks to winners like burrs to a sheep’s fleece.With Mrs May we have become depressingly used to things going wrong. She called a general election and somehow mislaid her majority.She made a speech at a Tory conference and the back-wall lettering started to fall off, like something from TV’s Reggie Perrin.She travelled to Germany and the door of her limo became stuck.Let’s face it: She’s a bit of a Frank Spencer, but without the laughter.Ill-fortune alone is not the reason she should go. It is her serious and serial failures as a politician, as a leader, as a communicator and parliamen-tarian that qualy her for the chop.Back in , when Gordon Brown was crowbarred out of Downing Street, some of us reckoned we would never see a worse Prime Minister.Alas, Mrs May has made calamity Brown look like Alexander the Great.She’s even less suited to the premiership than poor old Huddersfield Town.To be Home Secretary demanded mastery of small print and remorseless hard work.She lasted six years in the job and was held to have been a success .To be Prime Minister is a dferent matter. It requires vision, a sense of political philosophy, an ability — at the risk of getting flowery — to think in poetry, not prose.A good Prime Minister is like a powerful preacher, selling beliefs and soothing the people’s fears. Mrs May, as PM, has only ever stoked fear. She has made us all feel miserable.It did not help that she never believed in the  referendum’s Leave vote. She herself practically vanished in the referendum campaign, saying she supported Remain but doing almost nothing for her side. That’s cowardly.Then, when it suited her purposes, she said “Brexit means Brexit”. Her volte-face did not convince the European Commission, which clocked her as a bluffer. When she said “No Deal is better than a bad deal”, Brussels knew she would fold.A proper political leader delegates. Mrs May, however, has a mania for secrecy and it was this that led to the damaging resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson after she ambushed them with her Chequers plan last summer.She had failed to keep them informed of her plans for Brexit.The loss of those two men meant she no longer had the support of numerous pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers.Then there is her personal manner. This is going to sound ungallant but at Westminster the personal is political.She lacks an easy touch with her Parliamentary colleagues.She is an awkward mixer. Even when her voice is working, it lacks honey.One can over-state the importance of front-of-house charm — David Cameron had it in buckets and he still came a cropper — but you do need social cop-on to be an effective leader, particularly of a minority Government.I am not saying Mrs May is a bad person. She is a churchgoing soul without personal greed.She is financially honest — unlike at least one of her recent predecessors — and remarkably resilient, not least in the way she has coped with her diabetes.But you do wonder why someone so hesitant in speech and character ever went into politics. Should she not have become a judge or civil servant instead Her record of appointments has been fy. She made that sly dullard Philip Hammond her Chancellor. Have we ever had two people so unscintillating as PM and Chancellor She kept filling her Cabinet with Europhiles, even though they had little hunger for a proper Brexit.She also reappointed Amber Rudd to her top team as Pensions Secretary just a few months after former Home Secretary Rudd had left amid the Windrush scandal.How did lelong Euro-obsessive Rudd repay the favour  By plotting against May and colluding with Tory Remainers to try to block Brexit.A proper leader would not have tolerated smirking snoots like Dominic Grieve and Sir Oliver Letwin, two Tory backbenchers who have conspired against Brexit in direct contravention of their  election promises.A proper leader would have ripped into them, laying bare their elitist disregard for the millions of working-class voters who demanded that we leave the anti-democratic EU.May just simpered and dithered.She will probably have to stay for a few weeksuntil we finally leave the wretched EU, but after that the Tories must find a new leaderthey are to have any hope of winning the General Election that looks imminent.Tory activists love Boris but it is hard to see envious MPs putting him through to the final two on the ballot. Jeremy Hunt would be another May. Sajid Javid comes across as metallic and bald in more than one sense.The likeliest bet may be Andrea Leadsom, the pro-Brexit Leader of the Commons, though she needs to work on her profile.But really it could be anyone.

I always reckoned they — our betters — would never let it happen. Yes, it’s a betrayal of democracy and we should be angry. We should march and stuff.But it won’t do much good. Because this is what happens when you have a House of Commons, House of Lords, Civil Service and broadcast media all massively in favour of Remain, against the wishes of the majority of the people.There are ten parties in the House of Commons,you count Sinn Fein . Nine are by a majority in favour of Remain.Recently, a new group of so-called Independents formed, drawn from the Labour and Conservative parties. They are even MORE in favour of Remain. So a proper Brexit was never going to get through.But it’s not just Brexit. On loads of other issues, the party ides in the House of Commons do not remotely match the ide which exists in our country. That’s because all of the parties in Parliament are basically liberal, except for the tiny DUP.So, take immigration. All of them are in favour of the vast numbers entering the country each year. While more than  per cent of the British people want an end to untrammelled immigration.It’s a Conservative government which is insisting that junior school kids be taught about transgenderism, same-sex partnerships and so on. None of the major parties will stick up for the traditional family — which often offers the best outcomes for children.But all of the major parties will stick up for Islam, despite the sincere reservations many of the rest of us harbour. They are scared of taking tough action against jihadis whohere from Syria. Most of us would like them booted out of the country, right now.And they act like this because they are liberals — a dying political creed which is on the run across Europe and the USA and South America. And which has never been very popular in Asia.I think we need to spend more money on stuff like the NHS, housing and regional development. I think there’s a corrosive ide in the UK between North and South and between the haves and have- nots. I like the idea of our railways being in state hands. That should make me a Labour supporter.But I cannot abide that anti-Semitic rabble, their loathing of the UK and the nation state — and their support for every form of victimhood which raises its screeching head. Or their support for anti-Western, racist terrorists and failed communist states. Nor, indeed, their generosity in handing out taxpayers’ money to the perpetually idle. My rule is,you don’t give, you don’t get.My guess is a lot of people feel the same way. But in the House of Commons there is no party to vote for which squares that circle. Outside Parliament there is — the Social Democratic Party, which is growing rapidly and ticks all those boxes I mentioned above. I joined them recently.But otherwise we have a House of Commons which, on a whole bunch of crucial issues, does not reflect the opinion of the majority of the country.If this Brexit catastrophe tells us anything, it’s that our politics MUST change. The people must be given a voice.And nine million people in the world die every year as a consequence of global air pollution.These are pretty shocking statistics.But two thoughts occur.First, almost everything we’ve done to reduce air pollution hasn’t worked. For example, we tried to force everyone to drive diesel cars.Then discovered they were even worse than petrol engines.Second, isn’t it simply because there are more and more of us on this crowded island and on this crowded planet HERO of the week is Countdown star Rachel Riley. She just won’t back down, ever. She’s spent the past year calling out the Labour Party for its repulsive anti-Semitism.For her trouble, she was mercilessly trolled by Corbyn’s groupies.

That is a bra.She continued: I don’t want to criticise you Emily but we live in a world today where we get all these sexy selfies.I think we have to wake up and wise up about the fact that you are demeaning what we’ve been trying to fight for all this time.The incident occurred on March  when Emily, from Solihull, was embarking from Birmingham on a flight with six pals to Tenere.She explained: I wore that outfit through security, through the whole of the airport and then I got onto the plane.The flight attendant said that I was inappropriately dressed and I needed to cover up.The flight manager and the flight staff all came over and stood there, then said: If you dont put a jacket on now were taking you off the plane.A guy two rows in front of me shouted: Shut up you pathetic woman, put a f***ing jacket on and they all just let him shout at me.A gent two rows behind me was wearing shorts and a vest top and nothing was said to him.They were going to kick me off the flight and held it for  minutes.

as the PM has promised for the past two years.Tonights vote to delay our departure - by  votes to  - comes after MPs blocked a No Deal Brexit yesterday.But in a blow to Remainers who want us to stay in the EU permanently, an amendment calling for a second referendum fell to a landslide defeat.Mrs May will next week bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for a third meaningful vote.She says thatit passes, she will then ask the EU for a short technical extension until the end of June, to give Parliament the time to force through the necessary legislation.Butthe deal is defeated again, the PM has warned that Britain will have to stay in the EU beyond the summer and take part in European Parliament elections.It is still possible for EU leaders to block Mrs Mays request for a delay when they meet in Brussels next week.But most have signalled they will accept a relatively brief extension as long as Britain is still on track to leave with a deal.A spokesman said tonight: We take note of tonights votes. A request for an extension of Article  requires the unanimous agreement of all member states.Before voting to back a delay, the Commons defeated a Remainer plot to seize control of Brexit entirely by taking the parliamentary timetable out of the Governments hands.By a margin of just two votes, Mrs May saw off the revolt which would have been an unprecedented power grab by backbench MPs.Nearly two thirds of Tories voted against delaying Brexit even though the PM and most of her closest allies were in favour of an extension.Seven Cabinet ministers went against Mrs May in opposing the delay - Brexiteers Stephen Barclay, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom and Penny Mordaunt, plus leadership hopefuls Liz Truss and Gavin Williamson.Ms Mordaunt said tonight: We must deliver the result of the referendum, and hurry up about it!Top Eurocrat Donald Tusk warned earlier today that the delay could end up lasting a long time, saying: I will appeal to the EU to be open to a long extensionthe UK finds it necessary to rethink its #Brexit strategy and build consensus around it.Irelands foreign minister Simon Coveney added: If you have a long extension of Article , that opens up the debate in a much broader way to the overall approach that the United Kingdom takes to Brexit.His boss Leo Varadkar called on Britain to stay in the EUs single market and customs union.Tory veteran Ken Clarke, known for his Europhile views, added: I think we should suggest to the Europeans a good, long delay.As well as the main motion, the Commons voted on a string of Remainer amendments after Speaker John Bercow infuriated Brexiteers by blocking an anti-second referendum motion.More than  MPs from three dferent parties signed up to a proposed amendment calling on the Government to respect the result of the  referendum.After Mr Bercow - who voted against Brexit - refused to select the motion, he was accused of being biased as Bernard Jenkin asked, What are we to conclude of your own views on these matters He picked four dferent amendments all tabled by Remainer MPs - including one calling for a second referendum and another giving the Commons total control of Brexit.Mrs May plans to hold another meaningful vote on her deal next week. She hopes Brexiteers will be bounced into backing the deal for fear of an endless postponement.The DUP is currently locked in talks with ministers as the PM ramps up her charm offensive to try and win over the Unionists.Its another blow for the PM as shes been forced to go back on her word.And even though it was technically a free vote so everyone could vote how they liked, seeing  of her own Tories go against what she opted for tonight makes her look incredible week.BUT, BUT, BUTActually, tonights votes could strengthen her.Shes effectively telling her Brexiteers that shes going to have to kick Brexit into the long grassthey dont back her deal.Many of them will be afraid of a long extension to Article  which would effectively give enough time for a general election or a second referendum.The PM now plans to bring back her deal next week in another attempt to push it through.If she gets it rejected yet again shell go to the EU and ask for an extension to Article  at the Council meeting at the end of next week.If it passes, shell ask for a short extension to get everything sorted.Theres no guarantee that they will say yes to an extension unless they know exactly what we want. If its just to legally cross the is and dot the ts, it will probably get voted through.COULD THERE BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM As it stands, not now.MPs tonight voted against a second Brexit vote, saying it wasnt the right time to push for it.But evenLabour had decided to back it, then it still wouldnt have passed, meaning its unlikely to ever get through the Commons at the current time.However,the EU force Britain into a long delay you can be sure the Peoples Vote campaigners will be out in force again campaigning to overturn the  result.ARE WE STAYING IN THE EU Yes, for now.Any extension means things will stay exactly the same until we sort out whats going on.And eventhe PMs deal goes go through, things will be the same until the end of  during a transition period, so we can get a trade deal sorted.Well technically be out of the EU but will still pay them some money and have to abide by many of their rules.IS BREXIT STILL HAPPENING Yes. Its still law that were leaving on March , no matter what happens.Unless MPs pass a bill to stop that, or Theresa May revokes Article  before then, we leave without a deal.Mrs May could only ask for an extension to put that date back by a few weeks or months, but theres no guarantee that they will say yes.WILL THERESA MAY STAY AS PM It would be a terrible time to boot her out now, in the middle of all this mess.But we shouldnt rule anything out.The PM did manage to dodge a few bullets this evening - including to stop MPs taking control of the process, for a second Brexit vote, or for Labours alternative plan.She came very close to losing but just managed to get it in the bag.Leader Arlene Foster said: When you come to the end of a negotiation thats when you really start to see the whites of peoples eyes, and you get down to the point where you make a deal - and we want to see a deal.And Remainer Tories including Boris Johnsons brother Jo were summoned to  Downing Street for negotiations today.The PM will attend a European Council summit next Thursday where shell officially request an extension to the Article  process.The Government said this morning thata deal is still not agreed by then, Mrs May will have no choice but to ask for a delay of several months.That would mean Britain taking part in the European Parliament elections in May.Opening todays Commons debate, deputy PM David Lidington promised thattheres still no deal by the time of the European Council, MPs would get two weeks to vote on a wide range of Brexit options and decide what they prefer.But Brexiteers warned that any delay will be nothing more than a smokescreen to block our EU exit completely.In a video message to followers, ex-minister Esther McVey blasted: It could mean that Brexit is defeated, the democratic will of the people is thrown away and we end up remaining.One of the PMs former top allies today called on her to quit as soon as a Brexit deal is secured.George Freeman blasted: This chaos can’t continue. Something has to give. We need an orderly Brexit on March .If, to get the votes for that, the PM has to promise that she will go after the Withdrawal Treaty is secure, to allow a new leader to reunite the country and oversee the next stage, she should.And ultra-Brexiteer Christopher Chope even suggested he would vote to bring the PM down entirely and trigger a snap electionJeremy Corbyn tabled a fresh no-confidence vote."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit commons uproar jeremy corbyn","story":"NewsBrexit: Commons uproar as Jeremy Corbyn defends abstaining on second referendumThe Labour Leader said it remained a realistic option after the Peoples Vote campaign agreed now was not the right timeShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-corbyn-addresses-parliament-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn said he continued to support a second referendum on Britain leaving the EU - despite ordering MPs not to back a vote calling for it.Speaking after the call for a second referendum was defeated by a margin of  vote in the House of Commons, the Labour Leader said it remained a realistic option. But Mr Corbyn was met with jeers and cries of shame from MPs in the SNP , Lib Dems and Independent Group who had backed it today.But the Peoples Vote campaign that lobbies for the second referendum had urged MPs not to vote for the amendment - believing it wasnt the right time for a vote to be held.  Jeremy Corbyn said: Today I reiterate my conviction that a deal can be agreed based on our alternative plan that can command support across the House.I also reiterate our support for a Peoples Vote - not as a political point-scoring exercise but as a realistic option to break the deadlock. But Labour rebel Neil Coyle, who supported a second referendum, told the Mirror: “Labour members are fretting over the party’s failure to lead in seeking a new People’s Vote. “I am forced to break a whip for something that is supposed to be Labour Party policy but has not been backed today. “There is little time left to win a new public vote. Next week Labour must back it wholeheartedly and with no more reservations.” The SNP leader Ian Blackford branded Labours approach spineless and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mr Corbyn had broken his promise to support a peoples vote.   Mr Cable added: Clearly he has dficulties with the issue, despite the support of Labour MPs and Labour voters. It is disappointing, but I think it will come back again in the same way Theresa Mays deal keeps coming back. The House of Commons voted by  to  against an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Groupof former Labour and Tory MPs, who quit their parties in part because of dferences over EU withdrawal. But  Labour MPs broke the whip -  backed a second referendum and  voted to take it off the table. Among those who voted to rule out a second vote were shadow health minister Justin Madders and Labour whip Stephanie Peacock.   Not a single Tory MP voted for the second referendum bid and  voted against it. Ten Tory MPs abstained - including arch-Remainers Jo Johnson, Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve. All  SNP MPs voted for a second referendum as did all  Lib Dems and all  members of The Independent Group. The result was greeted with glee by hard-Brexiteer and European Research Group chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg.

If Mrs May can persuade Tory Brexiteers and the DUP to finally back her, by threatening a huge delay and offering legal tweaks, then she will ask the EU for a delay until June . If she cannot agree a deal by next Wednesday, she will go to meet  EU leaders at a summit and Thursday and ask for a longer extension.  MPs voted resoundingly tonight to reject a second EU referendum. The - result came on an amendment to Theresa Mays Brexit plan by ex-Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston. The Independent Group MP wanted to instruct the PM to delay Brexit for long enough to legislate for and conduct a public vote on Brexit. The ballot paper would ask people to choose between a form of Brexit to be determined by Parliament, and Remain. But two official second referendum campaigns - Peoples Vote and Best For Britain - said it was not the right time or way to ask MPs. And Labour refused to back the amendment, instead asking MPs to abstain. Labour is keeping a second referendum as a possible option for the future but its not clear when, or how, it would back one.  An audacious plan to wrest control of the Brexit process away from Theresa May was defeated by just two votes. The amendment tabled by the powerful Remainer coalition of Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin was defeated -. It would have paved the way for a multiple-choice indicative vote by MPs on the way forward in the coming weeks. MPs would have been given the chance next Wednesday to take control of future Commons business, as long as it was for a proposal backed by at least  MPs from  parties. To avoid defeat, the government had already offered to table indicative votes itself - in the two weeks after next weeks EU summit. It was not immediately clear how far that promise would be honoured after the amendment was lost.  Next week is shaping up to be another week of high drama in Brexit that will shape Britains future. We are expecting a THIRD meaningful vote on Theresa Mays repeatedly-failed Brexit deal next Tuesday or Wednesday. She will try to use the threat of a years-long delay, and some small legal tweaks, to persuade Brexiteer Tory and DUP MPs to finally come on side. Wednesday is deadline day. If the PM has a deal agreed by the end of the day, she will ask the EU for a short technical extension to Brexit Day until June . If the PM doesnt have a deal agreed by then, she will request a potentially much longer extension at an EU summit on Thursday. EU chief Donald Tusk has said hes willing to grant an extension - but onlythe UK is clear about what it actually wants. EU leaders may choose to frustrate or delay a decision on an extension while MPs make a decision on what kind of Brexit they actually want. Thats where indicative votes come in. The government has said it will hold votes to allow MPs to shape the way forward in the two weeks after the summit next Thursday and Friday. That means MPs could be voting on the way forward in late March or early April. Beyond that - we just dont know. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn will continue to hold cross-party talks in a bid to push a much softer Brexit, including a customs union and possible alignment with the single market. He could have friends in high places on that front. Chancellor Philip Hammond has joined calls for consensus around a deal that a majority of MPs can back. A second referendum technically remains on the table for Labour, but despite the party officially saying it would back one in the Commons, its shown no sign of doing so yet.

May might yet loser her way to victory in a third or fourth vote despite cowardly denying the electorate a second referendum.   But a long delay, no Brexit, people’s vote or General Election are also possibilities. The uncertainty is excitingbad for the soul when quitting would be an historic mistake, Britain slipping into irrelevancy and insularity. We’re living through democracy as its very messiest, nobody in control and the popular will up for grabs. The last national test three years ago under another PM in a previous Parliament feels as relevant as the War of the Roses. Nobody in their right mind could pretend to have voted for this poundm a week-less chaos, job losses and poison.   Remainers shouldn’t be triumphalist or Leavers totally despondent when there is all to play for but there is hope that Britain’s future in Europe might be saved. Never before has so much money, time and effort been wasted on a foolish mission to create a poorer and insecure Britain. Delusional lying Brextremists should own their fiasco.

Georgina Lochrane, , called manipulative Aaron Campbell, , an animal and believes the death penalty should be brought back. But today she told Daily Record: I do want to go to see him. He has to approve the visitation but I’m more than happy to go face-to-face with him. I want him to look me in the eyes and I want to know why. Campbell abducted six-year-old Alesha from her bed on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, before sexually assaulting her, suffocating her and leaving her naked body lying in woods. The evil killer will be sentenced tomorrow at Glasgows High Court. Grief-stricken Georgina, who has a four-year-old daughter Courtney, added: I just want to know, why her  Why Alesha   I have questions that need answered and he is the only one who can answer them. If you woke Alesha up, she cried. If someone went into her room who she didn’t know, she would have screamed and tried to hide. If she couldn’t find anywhere to hide, she would have tried to run. If she was awake, she would have got out of his grip and tried everything she could. She would have bitten, kicked, scratched and done everything in her power to get away. He’s got to have put her unconscious before taking her out of that house. I’ve never understood how a house with four adults in it couldn’t hear a thing.  Now Campbell has ruined Georginas dream of having more kids. The mum, of Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, continued: I would have liked more children but now I just couldn’t.I’m petried. How can I bring another child into this world when it isn’t safe  I think everything is going to happen to my four-year-old. I get up in the night to check she is still breathing. I’m so paranoid and that’s all down to him. Everything that seemed completely impossible to me has all become possible.  My family are broken. We just don’t know how to pick ourselves up.What happened to Alesha has crumbled us and there’s no coming back from it. I just want to cuddle Alesha and tell her it’s OK and that’s not possible. It kills me every day. Following a nine-day trial, a jury at Glasgows High Court found Campbell guilty. The judge who presided over the trial lted a ban on naming the warped youth.  Judge Lord Matthews told the teenager he had committed some of the wickedest, most evil crimes the court had ever heard. Alesha was on holiday staying with her dad Rab, , and grandparents Calum MacPhail and Angela King in their Rothesay home when vile Cambell struck in the early hours of July  last year. Her body was found in woods less than half a mile from the flat just before am. Less than three hours earlier, Calum and Angela had woken to find her missing from the flat.  Within two days, police had local schoolboy Campbell in custody. He and Alesha had never met before. When the verdict was read out and he was walking down the stairs, he smiled at us, at our full family. If he is  and has committed a crime which the pathologist said is the worst he has ever seen, imagine what he can do in  years’ time.He’s in a cell and has time to plot. He has clearly thought it out. That does not deserve to ever be released back into society. That thing is an animal, Georgina said.

A whopping , eager race-goers are expected to flood the final day of the festival and bet an incredible pound, per second. The Gold Cup is second only to the Grand National as the year’s biggest betting day. The Pat Kelly-trained Presenting Percy is the   favourite, but the bookmaker Ladbrokes has described this year’s race as the most open in years. Last year’s winner Native River is   second favourite, with King George winner Clan Des Obeaux priced at  .   Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes said: “The Gold Cup is the pinnacle of the Festival, with a staggering amount of money set to be gambled across the nation. “This year punters have a real task on their hands picking the winner with the front three in the market all holding solid claims.” Among the hopeful owners going for glory today is none other than Sir Alex Ferguson himself.

On Thursday there was not a dry eye on the course as an emotional Cheltenham cheered on blind race horse owner owner Andrew Gemmell.   The former council worker and union rep, , has been blind since birth and relies on friends to describe the race to him. His horse Paisley Park, named after the late singer Prince’s home and recording studio, nearly died two years ago from a serious illness.

An overjoyed Gemmell told The Mirror he might just “treat myself to a shandy or two” after the race. He said: “This is fantastic and a real dream for me. I cannot believe this has happened.   “I still had hopes [during the race] because we know that is the way Paisley Park runs. “I hope this is the first of many because I will keep coming back. We are so chuffed and we’re all in tears. “It was a scary moment when he made a mistake at the last too. “This has been a brilliant journey and I have enjoyed it all the way. I’ve been to Cheltenham for years and years. “It is just something  to be in the winner’s enclosure.”  But it was not plain sailing for Paisley Park who was pushed all the way by   outsider Sam Spinner rode by jockey Joe Colliver, . Colliver was not even supposed to be in the race as he was pencilled in for an appearance at court in Harrogate on a drink drive charge but he managed to get his court date changed.

Alan kept his new locks under a flat cap just two days after undergoing his second hair transplant.

But despite files on four men being sent to the Crown Prosecution Servicenobody has ever been charged.   Mr Lawrence has spent years campaigning for the introduction of what has become known as Claudia’s Law. The new law due to come into force this July, will allow families of people who have been missing for more than  days, to deal with their affairs.

Over the course of separate investigations by Portuguese and British police dozens of potential suspects have been identied but several high-profile breakthroughs in the investigation have come to nothing. Now, a new Netflix documentary, released on Friday, March , examines the disappearance of the British toddler. In the trailer for the documentary, a number of experts, police officials and people related to the investigation give snippets of quotes to the camera. The police had suspicions that there was some collusion happening during the night that Maddie went missing, a voice says. A third tells the camera: This could be the breakthrough - here it is, it all fits. Kate and Gerry declined to participate, saying in a statement that the documentary wouldnt aid the search for their daughter.   Back in , politan Police launched an investigative review - Operation Grange - to re-examine the material from the Portuguese-led investigation, totalling , documents, , potential sightings, enquiries into  sex offenders,  lines of investigation and more than  persons of interest. But the painstaking work came years after early investigations had pursued several dead-ends - most notably an -hour grilling of Gerry and Kate McCann after they were made arguidos four months after her disappearance. Earlier this month, police requested another year of funding, with the Met asking the Home Office for around pound, Scotland Yard was given around pound, to continue the investigation last October. Speaking in December, politan Police commissioner Cressida Dick vowed the search will not stop until it has reached its conclusion. Here are some of the publicised breakthroughs in the investigation which led detectives down blind alleys. Robert Murat  Twelve days after Maddies disappearance -year-old British-Portuguese property consultant Robert Murat was named as the first arguido - or person of interest - in the case. He was questioned by police, had his home searched, swimming pool drained and cars and computers seized. There was nothing to link Murat to the disappearance and his arguido status was removed in July  when Portuguese police closed their investigation. Gerry and Kate McCann Portuguese police files released after the closure of the initial investigation reveal how Gerry and Kate McCann were forced to face a gruelling -hour interrogation as officers appeared to try and force a confession out of the heartbroken parents. The grilling came despite advice from British forensics experts that the DNA evidence found behind the holiday apartment sofa and the McCanns Renault Scenic hire care was inconclusive and flawed. Despite this, the couple were grilled over the DNA discoveries and askedthey were responsible for Maddies disappearance. Kate used her right to remain silent, speaking only once - and was accused by police of harming the search for her daughter.   During the interrogation, police asked:  On May , , around :, when you entered the apartment, what did you see  What did you do  Where did you look  What did you touch  Did you search inside the master bedroom wardrobe Can you describe its contents   Why was the curtain by the sofa near the side window tampered with  Did someone go behind the sofa   How long did your search of the apartment take after you detected Madeleines disappearance   Why did you say Madeleine had been abducted   Assuming Madeleine was abducted, why did you leave the twins to go to the Tapas and raise the alarm  The supposed abductor could still be in the apartment.  Why didnt you ask the twins then what happened to their sister or why didnt you ask them later on   When you raised the alarm at the Tapas what exactly did you say - what were your exact words   What happened after you raised the alarm there    Why did you go and warn your friends instead of shouting from the verandah   Who contacted the authorities   Who took place in the searches   Did anyone outside the group learn of her disappearance in those following minutes   Did any neighbour offer you help   What does we let her down mean   Did Jane Tanner tell you that night shed seen a man with a child   How were the authorities contacted and which police force was alerted   During the searches, with the police there, where did you search for Maddie, how and in what way   Why did the twins not wake up during that search or when they were taken upstairs    Who did you phone after the occurrence   Did you call Sky News   Did you know the danger of calling the media, because it could influence the abductor   Did you ask for a priest   By what means did you ulge Madeleines features, by photographs or by any other means   Is it true that during the searches you remained seated on Maddies bed without moving   What was your behaviour that night   Did you manage to sleep   Before travelling to Portugal, did you make any comment about a foreboding or a bad feeling   What was Madeleines behaviour like    Did Maddie suffer from any illness or take any medication   What was Madeleines relationship like with her brother and sister   What was Madeleines relationship like with her brother and sister, friends and school mates   As for your professional le, in how many and which hospitals have you worked   What is your medical speciality   Have you ever done sht work in any emergency services or other services   Did you work every day   At a certain point you stopped working, why   Are the twins dficult to get to sleep  Are they restless and does that cause you uneasiness   Is it true sometimes you despaired at your childrens behaviour and it left you feeling very uneasy    Is it true that in England you even considered handing over Madeleines custody to a relative   In England, did you medicate your children  What type of medication   In the case files, you were shown canine forensic testing films. After watching them, did you say you couldnt explain any more than you already had   When the snfer dog also marked human blood behind the sofa, did you say you couldnt explain any more than you already had   When the snfer dog marked the scent of corpse coming from the vehicle you hired a month after the disappearance, did you say you couldnt explain any more than you already had   When human blood was marked in the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldnt explain any more than you already had   When confronted with the results of Maddies DNA, carried out in a British lab, collected from behind the sofa and the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldnt explain any more than you already had   Did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughters disappearance   The McCanns left Portugal on September ,  - two days after the appalling ordeal. The national director of the Policia Judiciaria Alipio Ribeiro later publicly stated the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects and the investigation was closed with no evidence to link the Gerry and Kate to the disappearance. The mysterious prime suspect  This sighting by Jane Tanner - one of the Tapas Seven - became a defining image of the investigation and six years on was established by British detectives to be almost certainly a red herring. Mrs Tanner said she left the groups table at the tapas restaurant inside the Ocean Club complex to check on her children around an hour before it was discovered Madeleine had disappeared. She said she noticed a man wearing a dark jacket and beige trousers walking away from the McCanns apartment carrying a child in pyjamas similar to Maddies. Portuguese police released an artists impression of the man and described him as a key suspect. In , British detectives under Operation Grange identied the man was in fact a British holidaymaker who had been carrying his own daughter. Former Operation Grange head DCI Andy Redwood described it as a revelation moment which shted the focus of the investigation. Raymond Hewlett  Convicted British paedophile Hewlett had been staying in a converted truck at a camping site near the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in . He died, aged , of cancer in Germany in . Hewlett was jailed three times in the UK for sex crimes against young girls in the s and s. But he went to his grave refusing to speak to investigators probing Maddies disappearance. Retired Detective Inspector Dave Edgar, who led a three-year private investigation, said: In terms of fitting the profile, Hewlett would probably come as close as you would get to a main suspect But he added: “There was no hard and fast evidence because,there had been, he would have been arrested. He was someone who we just wanted to speak to and look at. Euclides Monteiro  Recovering heroin addict Euclides Monteiro, a convicted burglar, died in a tractor accident in . Monteiro used to work as a waiter at the Ocean Club but was sacked for stealing tips a year before Madeleine disappeared. He was working at a water and sewage plant half a mile away from where Madeleine vanished from the Ocean Club complex at the time of her disappearance. In , police searched the site behind the water plant with snfer dogs but the search ultimately proved fruitless. His widow Luisa Rodrigues was interviewed by Portuguese detectives but insisted he was an innocent man. Portuguese media reports in  said he had been ruled out as a suspect.

Ten-year-old Ella Thatcher’s sudden death from an epileptic seizure mean her heart, lungs, liver and pancreas and two kidneys saved others from a similar fate. It comes as an historic organ donation bill should become law today with the granting of Royal assent to herald the start of a cultural sht towards le saving transplants. Presumed consent will come in to force next year meaning organs will be donated unless a patient had opted out. But crucially, bereaved family will still be able to veto transplants. Ella suffered from a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome but the family thought she had it under control after her seizures reduced from  a month to one every six months.   That was before she suffered a devastating attack at their home at Hurstpierpoint, near Brighton, one morning last year. She stopped breathing and paramedics revived her before she was transferred by ambulance to the specialist Evelina London Children’s Hospital. Mum Anna thatcher told the Mirror: “Ella had gone for a scan and when I got there late at night the doctors said ‘it’s a bit noisy in here let’s go to another room’. We thought that didn’t sound good. “He told us Ella had swelling on the brain and was ‘essentially brain dead’. “We knew she wasn’t well but we hadn’t expected that. We were just stunned.” The family were allowed to sleep in the room with Ella that night. The next morning Anne and dad Mike broke the news to her siblings Oliver, , and Mia, . Each of them spent some time alone with Ella and they said their goodbyes.   “She then had to be declared brain dead by two doctors, that was the hardest part,” Anna said. “We asked to be in the room when they have to turn the oxygen off to check she cannot breath for herself. We were holding her hand willing her to blink or something, but there was nothing. “Organ donation was the first thing we thought of when we found out there was nothing we could do. “Before they took her away I was able to lie next to her. The nurse was amazing and agreed to hold her hand throughout the surgery. When she came back she had a lovely blanket over her up to her shoulders. “You don’t see the scars where she has been neatly sewn together. She just looked asleep and peaceful. It was all done with so much respect. “Then we left the hospital to plan the funeral.” The Organ Donation Bill should receive Royal assent today meaning it becomes what has been named Max and Keira’s Law.Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to name the law after campaigning -year-old Max Johnson and his nine-year-old heart donor Keira Ball.It comes after a three year campaign by the Daily Mirror and is expected to save hundred of lives every year A multimillion pound awareness campaign will now encourage families to discuss their wishes should the worst happen. Anna, a principal at a language school, added: “We realised she was gone and we didn’t want anyone  to feel like we did. “Because of Ella five families don’t have to plan funerals, think about grave stones and sit on the sofa in the morning waiting for their child to come downstairs. “We always knew there was a higher chance of infant mortality with Dravet, as it’s about one in , but this normally happens in children who have not got their seizures under control. “To us having her seizures under control like that was fantastic. “Ella had severe special needs and the mental age of an -year-old but she was happy. She was friendly and very affectionate and would lead you by the hand to walk to places. Other people’s livesto normal but ours don’t, we still miss her just as intensely. “I would say to any other parents in that same situation we were your loved one isn’t there anymore butyou can stop someone  feeling how you are now then just do it. “It will never bring them back but to know they have saved other lives is a tremendous comfort. “We deal and live with our loss every day but as time goes by, the thought of others walking around with a part of Ella is a huge reminder that she is not forgotten by others.” Samuel Newman, specialist nurse for organ donation at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, said: “There are more than , people alive today thanks to an organ transplant. “This would not have been possible without the generosity and selflessness of thousands of organ donors like Ella, and the bravery of their families. “Around , people are in need of an organ transplant in the UK so it remains as crucial as ever for people to join the NHS Organ Donor Register.” "},{"url":null,"title":"primark selling perfect summer dress","story":"NewsPrimark is selling the perfect summer dress - and its only £Primark shared a photo of the new summer dress on Instagram and shoppers cant wait to get their hands on itShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterCatherine Murphy:,  MAR NewsPrimark has done it again \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou might still be wearing your big coat every time you step outside the house, but shops are officially starting to get into summer mode.

Little Primrose Austins parents took the almost impossible decision to have her eyes taken away, after watching her suffer unbearable pain. The youngster had a build-up of pressure and a retinal detachment in one eye, while the other shrank to half its size. When Primoses dad Chris and mum Eryn, from Buford, Georgia, US, adopted the youngster from a Chinese orphanage in , they were told she was blind due to untreated congenital glaucoma. They were told the condition had caused her eyes to cloud over, and that she was potentially deaf.  Back at home in the States, tests revealed she had p deletion syndrome which caused her eye complications, unique brain structure, lack of muscle tone and other problems. After Primrose woke up in ‘crisis’ eight months ago,  specialists were baffled by what was causing her agony – that was so intense that she cried for  hours a day. An MRI revealed the extent of the damage to her eyes and her parents were forced to make the decision that would changer her le. Incredibly, since her eyes were removed, the youngster has made a miraculous recovery, starting to walk again and even learning a touch-based form of sign language to communicate.  Eryn,  and a full-time carer for her daughter, said: “It was like living in a constant nightmare, not knowing whether she would be ok. “Doctors tried to eliminate her source of pain one by one, we were at the point where they had worked through most of the causes. “It was an excruciating experience for us all, she was drenched in sweat, her body was dealing with such intense pain and her nervous system was going nuts. “She was hurting herself by not eating or drinking, I had to forced liquids into her mouth with a syringe to keep her hydrated.  “I was a heart-breaking decision to have her eyes removed but was  per cent the right thing to do, we never imagined two weeks later how much she would have progressed. “We were talking about le or death for Primrose, she was severely and critically ill. She added: It was a miracle, two days after she was standing up for the first time in months, was smiling and has made progress in other areas. “It’s like a whole new world is coming and it feels really good and positive, we think we will see a lot of changes in her.  “Teaching the world, she is worthy is the hardest part, as we are a society obsessed with perfection.

The Connecticut Supreme Court today narrowly reversed an earlier decision by a lower court judge that had prevented them from taking legal action against Remington. The gun maker manufactured the gun, an AR-, used to kill  people, including  children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December . The decision allows families to now sue over how it marketed the Bushmaster rle In their ruling, Justice Richard Palmer wrote: “Following a scrupulous review of the text and legislative history of we also conclude that Congress has not clearly manested an intent to extinguish the traditional authority of our legislature and our courts to protect the people of Connecticut from the pernicious practices alleged in the present case.   “The regulation of advertising that threatens the public’s health, safety, and morals has long been considered a core exercise of the states’ police powers.” Accordingly, on the basis of that limited theory, we conclude that the plaintfs have pleaded allegations sufficient to survive a motion to strike and are entitled to have the opportunity to prove their wrongful marketing allegations.” A Superior Court judge in Bridgeport, Connecticut, had previously dismissed the  claim agreeing with Remington’s lawyers the lawsuit “falls squarely within the broad immunity” provided to gun manufacturers and dealers by the arms act.   A survivor and relatives of nine people killed in the massacre filed the lawsuit arguing the rle used by killer Adam Lanza is too dangerous for the public and Remington gloried the weapon in marketing it to young people. Lanza was -years-old when he killed his mother in their Newtown home before storming the nearby elementary school he had attended and opened fire.

In contrast, now I have people constantly telling me that I bring them joy, which brings me joy too.” Asstyn, who will not give her real name, said her le changed forever during a date in .She added: “I met a man on a dating site who worked in the adult industry and he mentioned BBWs.“He thought it would suit me, and that I’d be really successful. I didn’t know there was such a thing, and had never heard of BBW before, but I really liked the whole body positivity aspect of it.” Stuck in a rut in her humdrum job, Asstyn - who shares her custody of her two children with their dad and only does porn shoots when she is not looking after them - was suffering with diminishing self-esteem when adult work was suggested to her. Always curvy, she had also spent years battling with her body image.   Asstyn said: “Over the years I have been all dferent sizes. I have even lost a signicant amount of weight. But I now know that, for me, that wasn’t the solution to self-acceptance. “You really have to love yourself. I see girls and women all the time who, by society’s standards, are thin, but still tear themselves apart. “Everyone is perfect to someone, but the main thing is confidence. Men love a confident woman. Obsession over calorie counting and weight is a turn off to a lot of guys.” By the time she met her date, Asstyn had accepted she would “never be skinny,” but she loved the positive sound of the BBW world so took to the internet and began researching it. She said: “At first, I had a really warped idea in my mind about what the adult entertainment industry was. “I was concerned that these bigger ladies would be being mocked, but as soon as I saw their photos and videos, it was plain they were being truly appreciated. They were absolutely beautul, too.” Happy to see fuller figures being celebrated, Asstyn was drawn in right away and, in June , decided to make her first foray into the industry herself. First she set up a Twitter account, where she shared racy snaps of herself.This soon attracted the attention of adult entertainment companies, who invited her to take part in some shoots. Around the same time she was facing redundancy at her “ordinary” job so bravely decided to jump into full-time porn work. From there, she shot a number of scenes – mostly boy girl, where she had sex on camera with one male partner - and, in January , she launched her own website. She said: “I was a little nervous about it all at first, but I also felt like I had been living my le for other people for so long that it was time for me to live for myself. “I had to overcome a lot of fear around other peoples’ perception of me. I’d been held back in the past by worry over what other people would say - but I now consider my own happiness above what other people think of me.” “I had to overcome a lot of fear around other peoples’ perception of me. I’d been held back in the past by worry over what other people would say - but I now consider my own happiness above what other people think of me.” “I had to overcome a lot of fear around other peoples’ perception of me.  I’d been held back in the past by worry over what other people would say - but I now consider my own happiness above what other people think of me.” Now a fully fledged BBW star, she is on a mission to spread a message of sex positivity. Whenever she is not looking after her children Asstyn travels around the USA shooting X-rated content, including threesomes and fetish scenes. Unfazed by having sex with strangers, she stressed that her job is about living out a fantasy for her viewers. She said: “Sometimes you don’t have the best chemistry, so a scene can be a struggle but the best performers are the ones that can overlook that and provide a fantasy for the fans.” Asstyn doesnt want to disclose her exact income, which she said can y depending on what sort of scenes she is doing. But she loves her work and hopes that speaking out will encourage larger ladies to appreciate their own beauty as well as helping to break societal taboos around women and sex. Asstyn explained: “I consider myself to be a sex-positive feminist. I don’t agree with shame and stigma around female sexuality in our culture, and hate that there is such a double standard. “That’s why I do my absolute best not to fake orgasms. I want to see a focus on women’s pleasure as well as men’s.”  While she attracts the odd negative comment from trolls, particularly on social media, Asstyn said the reaction to her work from the public and her loved ones has been mainly positive. Currently single, working in the adult industry has not put her off relationships, but she is yet to find the right man. Meanwhile, speaking of her career plans, she said: “This has been an adventure – one I want to continue. “I’d love to see more body types accepted across the board, and love that the main draw of BBW work is seeing the fuller figure celebrated. In the rest of society, it’s not often you see a bigger lady flaunt her body. “I am also seeing more and more performers work into their s and s, which is fantastic. “Your sex le doesn’t stop at the menopause. Now, there’s a market not just for sexy mums, but for sexy grans, too - so I don’t think I will be stopping any time soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr pimple popper removes sausage","story":"NewsDr Pimple Popper removes sausage roll-shaped lump which smelt like  dead ratsWARNING: UPSETTING SCENES Gruesome growth had thrived for  years before Leonard visited Dr Sandra LeeShareByDave Burke:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video dr-pimple-popper-attacks-sausage-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man with a huge sausage roll shaped lump on his shoulder finally had it removed after a decade in a procedure captured in gruesome detail.

He said it left him struggling to use his left arm after he ripped it open on a bush.  And he continued: It weighs lbs. I scratched it on a man-eating briar one day at work and it kinda teared a little bit and now its still trying to get out by itself. You can see where the skin is trying to go back together around it.  It feels like two pairs of pliers grabbing my skin and ripping it apart very slowly. He added: It smells bad all the time. It started smelling like rotten deer head and now it smells like  dead rats.  Carrying out the procedure, Dr Lee says: You saw it come out, its like a flower. The lump is a lipoma, which grows beneath the skin, and is caused by a build-up of fat cells.

Particularly against Inverness last week, they seemed to be able to keep United at arms’all too easily.I think that had a lot to do with the tempo of their play, which was not high enough.

We knew what we had to do, especially the new boys that have come in, and the rest of lads, we knew it was going to be dficult and it’s made it a lot more dficult now.“Whatever happens during the week happens, we just need to focus on ourselves and Dunfermline on Saturday.“We’ve got to go again and try to win every game till the end of the season and see what happens.”Dundee United have placed third in their last two seasons in the Championship and, although it wouldn’t be ideal, a second-place finish would set them up for an easier ride in the play-offs, which have tormented them in the lower leagues so far.However, former Kilmarnock and St Johnstone man Connolly is only focusing on the here and now.That starts by doing what they didn’t do in Glasgow and taking their chances at East End Park on Saturday and, hopefully, fighting back at the top of the table.He added: “It’s dficult and it’s been frustrating but all we can do is not worry about what’s happened before but worry about what’s happening now.“It has been dficult the last few years but we’ve come in to a dficult situation as well and we have to stay positive and keep going till the end.“We’ve just got to kill teams off, we weren’t good enough on Saturday at times but at other times we’ve created so many chances that we’ve got to take.“We could’ve ended up winning the game in the second half but, unfortunately, recently we haven’t been taking our chances and made it hard for ourselves.“We’re bitterly disappointed and there’s not much more we can say than that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre celtic a different animal for dundee","story":"Manager Jim McIntyre says Dundee need to be ready to face a dferent animal when Celtic come calling this Sunday.The Dens gaffer was pleased with Dundee’s improved defensive display against Hearts last weekend where his side fell to a - defeat.That came after conceding four in each of their previous two outings against Hibs and Rangers.The Dark Blues boss urged his backline to be stronger after that and he felt against the Jambos they were.However, Jim knows his side will have to up their game again to get anything on Sunday and has warned they’ll face a dferent sort of attacking threat.He said: “We never gave up too many chances against Hearts.“In the main we defended well.“Ikpeazu is a handful and so is Vanecek but we handled them really well.“And it wasn’t just the strikers.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country.

Heathfield operator Ediston has applied to alter planning conditions to allow them both to occupy the former Homebase unit. The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan. Representing them, Planner Kathryn Donnelly told the meeting: “We believe the proposals could be incorporated into the town centre.” She added: “There is an urgent need to protect Ayr town centre.” Ms Donnelly, of GL Hern, told councillors: “We need to entice national retailers.”   She said Ayr Central supports  local jobs. Ediston representative Alex Mitchell said Food Warehouse would take up , square feet. Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it. Councillor Peter Convery said: “There isn’t one of us here who doesn’t want the town centre to be vibrant again.” Expressing his support for the High Street and Heathfield,  chair Councillor Brian Connolly said: “We want them all to be successful.” But Councillor Andy Campbell said: “This has been an opportunity to attract outlets to the town centre.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

This elegant, light-filled construction is a delightful example of the modernist work of Wormersley, among whose other structures are the ndash in my opinion ugly ndash football stand for Fairydean FC in Galashiels, to which architects flock from all over the world.Yet while the Klein Studio is of the architectural first-rank, it is also a landmark in the story of the Borders textile industry.

If only. How painful to think that, with the exception of Edinburgh Castle, probably our most famous single building was the Glasgow School of Art. It was A-listed, yet still appears not to have been taken care of properly.

More interestingly, it also advocated that HES be given powers to compel owners or custodians to safeguard celebrated buildings.An inquiry, sadly, wonrsquot bring back the school, but enhancing the authority with which HES can act would be a step in the right direction. At the moment, as with any listed building, custodians of the A-list cannot make structural changes without permission. Itrsquos a protracted and restricting procedure, which probably makes some deeply regret their purchase. Yet while these are necessary and important safeguards, there are none, it seems, that allow HES to step in and prevent ruination.

People can have their own opinions, so I am looking forward to hear what people think about it, and for people to come here in enormous numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-teacher-struck-off-for-forcing-toast-into-autistic-boys-mouth","story":"Alison Mackie, who taught at Chatelherault Primary School in South Lanarkshire, was pregnant at the time and experiencing personal problems, but the General Teaching Council said that even taking this into account, her actions were \"extremely serious\" and said removing her from the teaching register was its only option.Mackie, who is no longer at the school and is currently working in a specialist community support team, had shown no remorse or regret for her behaviour, the professional watchdog said.:Record number of teachers caught in exam cheat probeThe incidents, which took place in , were witnessed by shocked fellow teachers and teaching assistants, who corroborated each others accounts.Mackie was also found guilty of failing to comfort a pupil who was distressed, allowing him to bang his head on the floor or beat himself with his fists, and she instructed support staff to do the same.The  said: \"The teacher was in the habit of using phrases like tough love and the world doesnt revolve around him, when speaking about pupils,\" and said the allegations involved harm to very vulnerable pupils whilst in the teachers care, adding: \"The misconduct occurred over a number of months and amounted to a pattern of misbehaviour.\"Breaches of the professional code of conduct, which the  found proven on the balance of probabilities, were made more serious because the children involved were non-verbal and unable to say what was happening to them, the s report adds. \"This involved a number of very vulnerable pupils with little or no capacity to communicate,\" it says. The GTC concluded that Mackies actions caused pupils to be distressed to the extent that some self-harmed.Although she had a previously unblemished  year record, and the misconduct had been for an isolated period of time, it was \"extremely serious\".

I thought it was because hed had a lovely six weeks with me - in fact he was absolutely terried,\" she said.Pupil A, now , was so distressed he would hide his school unorm and on a trip to Marks and Spencer attempted to do the same in their clothing section, his mother said. \"I am angry and upset.

Mackie would leave him for several minutes which caused P to become more upset, and he was \"frequently\" left with bruises and markings to his head.The teacher also told colleagues to do the same. Classroom assistants would cradle him when this happened or put a cushion on the ground under his head, but Mackie instructed them not to.A further charge - that she deliberately fast-forwarded a DVD in the presence of P, knowing this caused him distress, was found not proven due to inconsistencies in the evidence. However a GTC fitness to teach  said it was satisfied that the witnesses were credible and not acting out of malice.Ps mother said the findings were \"breathtaking\".\"Im absolutely livid.

My son is still on medication for anxiety\".Charges were upheld relating to two other pupils, pupil R and pupil D, also part of the same class. On one occasion R was rolling on the floor refusing to brush his teeth and Mackie bent over him and pressed on his chest while asking a colleague to hold him down so she could brush his teeth. The colleague refused, and gave a \"graphic account\" to the GTC  of the distress this caused the boy.:Choir conductor who abused boy at cathedral is jailedPupil D had a routine which meant he ate his dessert before his savoury food at lunch, although he would always finish it.

In , he was told his kidneys were operating at just  per cent of their .Soon after, and only days after the birth of his son, Colton, Mr McGowanrsquos kidneydropped to % and he was rushed to hospital to have an emergency line fitted for dialysis.It was then he was put on the donor waiting list and, a year-and-a-half later, he finally received the call he had been waiting for: a match had been found. The transplant went ahead on January  at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.Speaking about her motivations, Ms Dfer, a support worker, said: ldquoWhen I read Allanrsquos story, I just remember thinking, I want to do this ndash and made the call.ldquoWhen I spoke to the donor co-ordinator, she explained I might not be a match for Allan but I told her that didnrsquot matter. Irsquod happily help anybody.Since ,  people have altruistically donated a kidney in Scotland. A healthy person can lead a completely normal le with one kidney and a transplant from a living donor generally offers the best outcome for patients living with organ failure.There are usually two routes to living kidney donation: directed donation, where a friend, relative or partner donates to a loved one or non-directed altruistic donation, which involves a person donating to a stranger who is matched on the waiting list, usually starting a chain of transplants.Ms Dferrsquos gesture is known as ldquodirected altruistic donation, as her wish was to donate directly to Mr McGowan even though she didnrsquot know him.Mr McGowan, who has worked as a labourer, said: ldquoIt was brilliant to think there was a chance I could get my le back, and that there was someone that would do that for me.In most cases, living organ donors and recipients have little or no contact but Ms Dfer was offered a meeting.ldquoNormally you can send letters via the donor co-ordinator but, as we were in the same hospital, she askedwe wanted to meet. Allan and his partner Coleen were there. They had a balloon and a card and gave me a hug and I started crying. I was a bit speechless meeting him and seeing how close we were in age.Mr McGowan said he ldquomust have said thanks about a hundred times when they met, adding: face-to-face for the first time, adding: ldquoIt was a total selfless act. It just shows you that there are good people out there.ldquoWersquore still in touch and me and Coleen are planning to take Jennie and Darren out for dinner once Irsquom back to full strength.ldquoIrsquom recovering well and am able to do so much more with my wee boy, who keeps me on my toes. Being rid of dialysis is brilliant. I have a future and I have Jennie to thank for that.Recent YouGov research highlights almost one third of people in Scotlandhadnrsquot heard of living kidney donation, while % said they would likely consider donating to family member and % said they would consider donating to a stranger.That is also what Maureen Jack did, changing the le of Margaret Jackson. Ten years ago Mrs Jack, now , from St Andrews in Fe, became one of the first people in Scotland to give an organ to save a strangerrsquos le. And, again unusually, she formed a bond with her ldquokidney twin.Meeting for a drink to reflect upon the events of a decade ago, -year-old Mrs Jackson, of Cumbria, said: ldquoI would be dead nowI hadnrsquot had a kidney transplant because I was in desperate need. What Maureen did was amazing and she has given me my le back. She has done me a very good deed and Irsquoll be forever grateful.In Scotland there are around  people on the kidney transplant waiting list and in the last  years  people have died waiting for an operation.Mrs Jack said she had a very personal reason for donating one of her kidneys as World Kidney Day falls on the anniversary of the death of her husband George, who died  years ago.Mrs Jack said: ldquoHe died from a non-kidney related problem and I would have done anything to give him his le back. So being able to do that for someone  has been important to me.ldquoIt was no more than a minor inconvenience for me but it has made a huge dference to Margaret. Itrsquos good to know that lsquoourrsquo kidney is still going strong.The pair met for the first time in Edinburgh four years ago at Mrs Jacksonrsquos request after years of contact, initially anonymously, through their hospitals and then exchanging Christmas cards.As it costs pound, for a donor operation and pound, a year for dialysis, there are signicant savings for the NHS, given the years people spend on dialysis.Chris Jones, chairman of Give a Kidney Scotland, himself a donor, said: ldquoOur ambitious aim is to make Scotland the first country where no-one need die for the want of a kidney."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9567514.jpg?type=article-full","title":"boy-becomes-100th-child-in-scotland-to-receive-kidney-from-living-donor","story":"Stephen Gallacher received the organ from his mother Cheryl in a transplant operation lasting just over four hours at Glasgows Royal Hospital for Children on Wednesday.Stephen, from Musselburgh in East Lothian, who became ill shortly after he was born, declared ahead of the procedure: \"Im grateful for this.

Scotland may be the windiest place in Europe, but that wind isnrsquot consistent. When it blows, the turbines turn, but you donrsquot always get a breezy force five when and where you need it.The answer lies in saving the power on blustery days and then using it on calmer ones. That means battery storage. This may sound a profoundly simple solution, but until now, its rollout has been hindered by technical challenges and the cost of the infrastructure.However, things are changing. Scottish Power has announced plans for a  megawatt battery storage facility at its Whitelee wind farm on Eaglesham Moor outside Glasgow ndash the biggest in the UK. And another company, RES, is managing a  megawatt storage centre at Broxburn, West Lothian, the first of its type in Scotland, on behalf of The Renewables Infrastructure Group .We are still catching up with the United States, where some . gigawatts of batteries have been deployed in the last year alone. But there is plenty of optimism. ldquoOur Broxburn project has been operational since last summer, says Tim French, RESrsquos Head of New Technology. ldquoItrsquos been very successful, operating at high levels of availability. The customer, National Grid, is very happy.RES has its own Glasgow-based control system that manages the batteries intelligently and assists with the operation and maintenance.The stored power is available   and feeds into the grid automatically when demand exceedssupply. The energy is stored in thousands of inidual but connected lithium-ion battery cells, stacked in arrays within containers. These cells have high capacity and respond quickly when needed.Deploying power in this way is not just environmentally friendly ndash it has a positive economic impact, too. National Grid calculates that battery technology will save it some pound million, which will ultimately feed through in lower costs to the end user. This is because this stored and readily available green energy avoids having to use other, more expensive generating options to keep supply stable.ldquoBecause the batteries can respond in super-quick time, the grid does not have to switch into these other sources,Tim French explains. ldquoWe use lithium- ion technology because itrsquos verygood at this kind of application. It is able to charge and discharge very quickly and the energy density within each cell is quite high.The combination of renewable power and flexible storage is reckoned to provide the most cost-effective low carbon solution for consumers. AnotherScottish energy giant, SSE, is also trialling lithium-ion storage including for solar , researchingit could be a cheaper solution than building new transmission lines.ldquoThe chemistry has been around for a while, with lithium-ion used in all sorts of applications over the last decade or so, but the main reason battery storage is now revolutionising the market is cost. of renewable energy projects constructed, under construction or at advanced planning stages.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: RES currently have more than , MWof renewable energy projects constructed, under construction or at advanced planning stages.\" class\"editor-image\"RES currently have more than , MWof renewable energy projects constructed, under construction or at advanced planning stages.ldquoThis has come down by as much as  per cent in the last three or four years.The ultimate aim of this technology is to allow the complete phasing out of fossil fuel generation over time. ldquoWe believe that can happen, says Tim French.ldquoObviously, wersquore on a journey, but one would hope that we could move quicker than we have until now. By , wersquod like to see fossil fuels off the grid.One issue which still needs to be fully addressed is not just how much power can be provided, but for how long. Typically, batteries can currently feed into to the supply for one to four hours before they become exhausted. This is enough most of time, but other technologies are still needed in order to prove more longevity.Dferent types of energy storage are already available, and some have been around for decades. The venerable Ben Cruachan pump hydro scheme on the shores of Loch Awe near Oban, for instance, has been generating power through water and gravity since .Other solutions include supercapacitors, solid state and lithium-air.These can be more suitable for short duration, high power applications.

The theory of evolution isnrsquot lost on electricity bills.One of the most important jobs that a property factor performs for his customers is to keep the lights on - literally. Our customers have hundreds of electricity supplies, some small, some enormous.When, in  Newton were considering their environmental strategy for the future, something quickly became obvious very quickly. Being one of the countryrsquos largest property factors in terms of our customer base, we were helping our clients pay invoices to energy suppliers totalling millions of pounds per annum.Converting this monetary volume into an accurate measure of CO emissions isnrsquot easy and we donrsquot claim to be experts but a simple calculator told us that collectively, by obtaining electricity from ldquobrown sources, our customers were generating several thousand tonnes of CO per year just to keep their close lights on.Taking this thought to its logical conclusion, we started scouring the market for competitive Green Energy suppliers, specically from suppliers who can certicate % renewable energy guarantees of origin.Derek MacDonald is joint managing director of Newton PropertySuppliers who can meet this test typically buy energy from the wholesale market which is generated from wind, solar, hydro schemes or renewable gas production.Interestingly, when you pick at the surface of the ldquogreen energy claims`, not all is as it seems. ScottishPower for example, both a supplier and a generator of electricity has been rightly lauded recently, for taking the bold step of selling on their carbon generating plants to Drax Power. According to its website, ScottishPower now generates % of its electricity from wind power, % renewable. All good then Look closer at the data however, and yoursquoll see that ScottishPower customers receive a mix of green and brown energy from the supplier as the company has to buy in electricity from other generators in the wholesale market in order to meet its nationwide customer demands. So technically speaking, ldquobrown energy isnrsquot its fault it simply cannot generate and store enough green energy to meet demand.What wind power generators really need is massive investment in energy storage facilities, to store excess capacity and to release it when demand peaks, not just when the wind blows. South Australiarsquos battery storage schemes though modest in size look like being a success. Imagine thenScotlandrsquos renewables generators could to take a lead in this and show the world how to do it  Imagine no more: the good news is ScottishPower has just announced a  megawatt battery storage project at Whitelee on Eaglesham Moor.What we would really like to see is a concerted effort from other private property management firms, housing associations and local authorities to steer customers towards communal electricity supplies from truly ldquogreen suppliers.This is a large market to be picked up by suppliers who will find it relatively straightforward to negotiate on price with these organisations and collective demand could equal more truly green energy supply.Interestingly, and very peculiarly, early on in our research we established that one ldquo% Green Supplier, which has really taken the market by storm refused to accept volume transfers of multiple supplies from us.Could this infer that currently due to lack of latent green energy storage, green suppliers cannot be too successful - otherwise they cannot deliver on their guarantee  A somewhat ironic paradox which might be about to be solved with lots of big batteries.Derek MacDonald is joint managing director of Newton Property.This article appeared in The Herald on the th March as part of The Heralds weekely Climate for Change editorial.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Our wives, husbands, hated neighbours, loved friends, tolerated colleagues, any and all Europeans that live here will be stripped of their rights and become less than us. Less secure, less valued, less physically safe. Our institutions will be impaired, our horizons narrowed.Edinburgh will be reduced for the second time in its history. After the loss of the national parliament in , it ceased to be a capital. Within Europe, its light, relit, has burned brightly for  years, and the city has taken its place as one of the great capitals. With Brexit this light will dim. Edinburgh will be cast down into parochiality. A secondary city within a secondary region of the UK. The city of the Enlightenment will be in the same all-British bracket as Slough, Norwich, Wolverhampton.For decades our horizons have been wide open. Paris, Rome, Prague, Helsinki. Scots have found berths in every one of these places, contributing to the community they find themselves in, acting as bees in the cross pollination of good ideas that has been helping the intellectual economy and cultural integration of Europe blossom.This is Scotland’s right historic place. We are on the edge of Northern Europe. Sutherland, Caithness and much of the Western Isles, not to mention Orkney and Shetland were domains with shared populations and experiences with Iceland, Norway, Greenland. Iceland’s women are  per cent descended from Scottish and Irish women.We are just a short stretch of water from the continent, and in the past those seaways have seemed like motorways. Poland teems with the ancestors of the , Scots families that flitted across the North Sea in the s, trading the famine raging at home for opportunities abroad. Scottish surnames given Polish inflection over the years include Kietzs , Losons, Ramzes and Szynklers. The four-time mayor of Warsaw between  and  Aleksander Czamer was born Alexander Chalmers in Dyce, Aberdeenshire.: Poll: Scottish independence more popular than Theresa May’s Brexit dealMore than genetics, more than common names bind us to our European neighbours. The very words in our mouths indicate our shared past and common present. The Scots language has common words in the Scandinavian language – such as ‘bairn’ for child and ‘braw’ for good – and in Ireland, our near European neighbour, Ulster Scots retains some vibrancy. Our own Scots Gaelic started le as the Ulster dialect of Irish, the shared languages evidence of endless Hiberno-Scottish relations. In Switzerland, I was surprised to come across a ft statue of Scotland’s queen-bothering reformer John Knox, towering above a central city park. At the statue’s feet was a massive mosaic of the Lion Rampant, Scotland’s ancient emblem. Behind the statue in the old town is the Kirk of Scotland. Elsewhere in the city, you’ll find the Genevan Gaelic choir meeting, and on other nights the Swiss Scottish Country Dancing Society.Some might say that these glory days of European influence are behind us. That Europe was our past and Brexit our future. Not so. Scotland is becoming more European as the years pass, not less.There are many tens of thousands of new Scots who are absolutely European, and no vote will change that. The Polish, Baltic state, Romanian migrants and their children, many Scottish born, who make up chunks of our population are and will remain European. Their next generation will likely be at least bilingual, with one modern European language as a mother tongue. Much as the great Irish migrations have redoubled the connections between Scotland and Ireland, so too will the legacy of the more recent eastern European migrations culturally tether future Scots to those countries.This is not an article in defence of the EU. This is an article in favour of open borders, of knowledge sharing, and of cooperation. I’m aware that the EU also creates borders and enmity with Russia, with Turkey and others. But saying the EU is too exclusive and so choosing Brexit is like complaining of claustrophobia in a large public park and curing it by upturning a bucket on your head.: Brian Monteith: Only a clean Brexit break can save us nowScots are Europeans by language, by history, by ancestry, by geography and by experience. Isolated from Europe, Scotland will be heading for another period of intellectual darkness.Our famous universities are amongst the best in the world. And our population is the second best-educated in Europe, in terms of university degrees per head. This is an enviable position for a small country to be in. And it’s down exclusively to internationalism and tight European connections. Our universities certainly carry out groundbreaking research, but they generally do so with large EU grants, or in conjunction with other universities. They almost always conduct research and education with large staffs of EU nationals, who will soon become legally insecure.The impact is already being felt. Scottish universities experienced a drop-off in applicants from EU countries. EU students are vital, as, although they are generally fee-free, they have a massive economic impact on the community around the university. They rent expensive flats, spend student loans in shops and bars, and work lower-paid jobs during their studies. When they graduate many stay, making positive contributions to their community and the economy. Those that leave become positive ambassadors for Scottish education internationally.In what can only be described as an intentional and massive ‘get it right up you, Scotland’, the Home Office has committed to offering EU students three-year visas to study in the UK. Degrees in Scotland take four years. In England, most take three.Our universities provide superb education to massive numbers of working-class and lower-income Scots. They are one of the key tools in providing social mobility in Scotland. They allow us to mix with European and international students, to form relationships that last letimes, to engage in projects and enterprises across a infinite number of fields. They are Scotland’s window to the world. They are a window through which Scots can reach out and have a positive impact internationally. Brexit will do much to close that window.Holyrood has been damaged too. How can we look to the parliament in Edinburgh as anything other than a diddy wee ‘pretendy’ parliament, when it can do nothing to either prevent Brexit or gain Scotland’s independence  There’s been a pro-European, pro-independence majority in there for umpteen years, and yet we are set to lose our European citizenship thanks to an English majority in its favour.All this talk of clf edges probably isn’t correct. Instead what we’ll experience will be long, slow subsidence. A steady trickling away of blood, of energy, of vibrancy. We are, right now, an integrated European partner on the cusp of independence. A new European nation right in the crucible of formation, with all the promise that entails.If Brexit drags Scotland with it, it will take us a very, very long time to get back to the position we are currently in today.Alistair Heather is a writer and presenter and is on Twitter @Historic_Ally©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon asked to apologise for disgraceful comment","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has been asked to apologise to a serving police officer after she branded his comments about public sector pay rises as #disgraceful#.Her remarks came in response to a letter read out by Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson at today’s First Minister’s Questions.The letter from an East Kilbride policeman questioned why officers received a smaller pay rise than teachers or NHS staff.He askedpolice were regarded as an “easy target” because they are barred from taking industrial action and questioned the value the Scottish Government placed on the police service.This year’s pay offer for police was . per cent compared with . per cent for teachers and nine per cent for NHS workers.But the First Minister hit back at the suggestion, and said: “Parts of those comments were quite disgraceful actually. I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scots less likely to back scottish independence due to snp currency plan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP plans to introduce a stand-alone Scottish currency after independence could damage support for a Yes vote, a new poll indicates.It came as the pro-union organisation Scotland in Union launched a campaign to \"save our pound\" as the prospect of a second independence referendum builds.: Nicola Sturgeon: I will ‘exercise mandate’ to hold independence referendum\u2028But the SNP has insisted that independence will allow Scotland to pursue the right currency for the country.Read more: Bolder SNP approach to separate Scots currency needed, say campaignersThe SNP is expected to vote to change policy at its Spring conference in Edinburgh next month to adopt a stand alone currency after independence, when a series of fiscal tests are met, under a motion being brought by Finance Secretary Derek Mackay.\u2028But a new poll by the pro-UK organisation today finds that  per cent of Scots would be less likely to back independence as a result of the policy, with just  per cent more likely to vote Yes.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2110-5-October-12-150x150.jpg","title":"highland council to engage in keep left campaign through two year","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Highland Council is to engage in a two-year programme of painting directional arrows on roads to remind tourists to drive on the left.During a recent area committee meeting in Portree, Gordon MacDonald, Highland Council#s roads manager, told local councillors that the scheme would begin in April .

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sentence overturned for man carrying flag","story":"AN IRSP activist who was convicted for carrying a flag during a Falls Road Easter commemoration has had his sentence overturned.In December last year, West Belfast man Sean Carlin was given a four-month suspended sentence for carrying a historical replica of an INLA Belfast Battalion flag during the commemoration in .The parade had been themed to honour local members who had lost their lives during attacks on the organisation following a  split. However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit extension to end of 2020 possible says irish","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are open to an extension of time but they want to know in what detail by providing that extension of time how they get certainty,” he said.Discussing the UK’s proposed tarfs on exports from the Republic in the event of a no-deal, Mr Coveney said: “If they are designed to try to put pressure on Ireland, it’s had the opposite effect actually. It’s actually galvanised the European Union.”Mr Coveney said he spoke with the EU Commission minutes after the details of the tarfs were published and that he had received a courtesy phone call from his British counterpart informing him of the proposed tarfs before they were announced.“I don’t think it’s workable and even the British government themselves say this is a very short-term arrangement,” he said.“What is needed in a no-deal scenario are urgent talks between the Irish government, the British government and the European Commission to put something more viable and sustainable in place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man left redfaced after sti gaffe","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year.

They came in and created a stud wall and painted the walls brown on the bottom and cream on the top and then distressed it to make it look as it had years of smoke on it.ldquoWith the ious props and bits and pieces, it really looked the part, he added.Brendan revealed that it was pure fate that led to the producers to ask to film there.He also insisted that the programme retained the shoprsquos name.ldquoA couple of guys were just out and about scouting around and thought that my shop was just what they were after for that scene, he explained.ldquoWhen they came in to discuss the matter, it turned out that one of the worked for me when I was a bar manager years ago up north.ldquoThey reimbursed me for two days of business and I felt that was fine because Irsquom hoping that there may be a spin-off for me with new customers once the programme airs.bull Episode three of Derry Girls airs on Tuesday at .pm on Channel ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Designer meets with Duchess again during Empire Bar visit  ","story":"SAINTFIELD fashion designer Meabh Mageean has the ear mdash and the eye mdash of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The  year-old was lucky to meet the Duchess for the second time when she visited Belfast with her husband recently.It was natural that their chat turned to weddings and clothes, given that one is regarded as the best-dressed Royal in the world and the other is an up and coming fashion designer.Meabh had been asked to meet the Duchess at an celebration of achievement of young people at the Empire bar.She had previously met with her last February at a fashion event in Buckhingham Palace.ldquoI was asked to meet and talk to the Duchess about that event and my own work, explained Meabh.ldquoShe was interested to know what I brought back from last yearrsquos event andit enhanced my business.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

Bryansfordrsquos Chris Brannigan was the lsquogo torsquo man for vital scores and Carryduffrsquos Ronan Lawlor won a Colleges All-Star award that year.Previous wins in the competition came in ,  and  with the teams of lsquo and lsquo going on to win the All Ireland Collegesrsquo B final.Cathair Dhoire may not have the same sort of identity or history as the Red High, but they will still be a tough nut to crack.The Red Highrsquos campaign didnrsquot start that well and they lost their opening group game - to - when Our and Lady and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, edged past them by the narrowest of margins.They picked up a bit of momentum following a comprehensive - to - victory over St Patrickrsquos, Keady.This was followed up by a - to - win over St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, before a - to - extra-time victory against St Malachyrsquos, Castlewellan, in the quarter-finals.St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, were their semi-final opponents, but they were no match for the Red High flair and went down - to -.Meanwhile, Cathair Dhoire enjoyed wins over Our Ladyrsquos, Castleblaney, Our Ladyrsquos and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, and Inis Eoghan, Donegal, on their way to the final. In addition, the St Columbrsquos players in the squad were also involved with their schoolrsquos senior team that won this seasonrsquos Markey Cup.The Derry side are blessed with a plethora of talented players, none more so than Ben McCarron, a highly-rated forward who played for his county in this yearrsquos McKenna Cup.St Patrickrsquos will look to their defensive markers, Eoin Rooney and Jack Harbinson, while skipper Ronan Murphy, Ciaran Watson and Peter McMullan will hope to turn defence into attack.Murphy is really looking forward to the final and believes that his team-mates have all the hard yards done in training.ldquoWe are really looking forward to the final. This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do. They obviously have good players to get this far with a few lads who have won Ulster Colleges All Star awards and played senior football for Derry, so, we know they are pretty decent.He continued: Getting to the final has created a real buzz and itrsquos infectious. Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do. We have invested a lot in this squad and they have responded brilliantly.ldquoHowever, there is no guarantee in football and know we have a lot to do to get our hands on the cup, he added.ldquoWe havenrsquot mentioned the fact that we are already through to the All-Ireland Collegesrsquo B semi-finals, regardless of Mondayrsquos outcome, as amalgamated schools are unable to compete in that competition.ldquoThe boys are focused totally on winning on Monday and they will not be taking their eye off the ball.The final is still a long way off for several players who face a weekend of action in other sports.ldquoWe canrsquot wrap up the boys in cotton wool, but I will be on the phone on Saturday night to several of the players to ensure they havenrsquot picked up any injuries, Mr Morgan said.ldquoHowever, we have a  strong  and they have all bought into the team ethos and our horses for courses policy.ldquoThe lads are so looking forward to the final and are fully aware of the schoolrsquos history in the competition.He added: Itrsquos been a while since the MacLarnon Cup was in Downpatrick, but I am convinced this squad can bridge that gap and bring the trophy back to the Red High for the first time in  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Michael’s are champions  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos wrapped up the - league title with two matches to spare when they overcame visiting St Patrickrsquos.

In these circumstances the evidential test for prosecution is not met.”The PSNI investigation into the events of Bloody Sunday commenced in , following the publication of the findings of a public inquiry led by Lord Saville.Mr Herron continued: “There has been a level of expectation around the prosecution decisions in light of the findings of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry. “I wish to clearly state that where a decision has been reached not to prosecute, that this is in no way diminishes any finding by the Bloody Sunday Inquiry that those killed or injured were not posing a threat to any of the soldiers.”He added: “We recognise the deep disappointment felt by many of those we met with today. As prosecutors we are required to be wholly objective in our approach. However, that does not mean that we do not have compassion for all those who are affected by our decisions. “Our role is to independently assess the available evidence and apply the test for prosecution.”A summary of the reasons for the decisions taken by the PPS was made available on its website to“provide assurance to the public” of impartiality.Fatal crash victim Jenner Kane a ‘well loved and respected care worker’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Londonderry, New Hampshire. Newry, South Carolina. Antrim County, Michigan. Belfast, Maine.Over a quarter of a million men and women left ports in Belfast, Larne, Derry-Londonderry, and Newry for the ‘New World’ during the th century, and they brought with them more than the names of their hometowns. Elizabeth Kennedy Trudeau, who is US consul general in BelfastThey also carried with them their hopes and dreams, their tireless work ethic, and their vibrant culture. These intangible gts became an integral part of the warp and weft of American society.Northern Ireland has given America presidents, artists, industrialists, academics, and community leaders.The far-reaching influence of the people of Northern Ireland on the values and traditions of the United States runs deep, and is still felt across America today. The perilous seven-week journey once endured by our forefathers can now be completed in under seven hours, facilitating daily two-way tourism and modern commerce and, perhaps most importantly, the continued exchange of ideas and expertise.Norman Houston OBE, Director of the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington D.C.Northern Ireland and the United States are more than friends and colleagues – they’re family. And, the traditional week of events and activities surround Saint Patrick’s Day celebrates these lasting ties.The Saint Patrick’s Day tradition in Washington, DC has existed since , when a bowl of shamrock was presented to President Harry Truman at the gates of the White House. For both Americans and the people of Northern Ireland, these events are a recognition of the enduring kinship and unity between our two nations.It is important to realise that our deep ties are not only historical, but also future-leaning. Norman Houston OBE, Director of the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington D.C.For the institutions of the Northern Ireland Bureau and the US consulate in Belfast, the events of this week further build upon the political, economic, cultural, and academic connections that we strive to cultivate every day. For the Northern Ireland Bureau, Saint Patrick’s week provides an unparalleled opportunity to showcase the many business, political, artistic and cultural interests to the highest echelons of American society. In the United States, these interactions are invaluable, allowing us to support Northern Ireland’s ongoing progress while encouraging steps to safeguard and build upon the gains that have been made.Almost all options are better than a bad Brexit deal signed in panic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This relationship extends far beyond the realms of politics, business and industry. Every year, many American universities waive fees and provide singular academic opportunities for students from Northern Ireland. Similarly, Americans are discovering the benefits of studying abroad in Northern Ireland at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.Northern Ireland’s two world-renowned universities, Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University, have long been attractive destinations for international students with a keen interest in conflict resolution and reconciliation.Almost half of Northern Ireland’s foreign direct investment now comes from the United States. Around % of the  US companies based in Northern Ireland reinvest in the region, which is a testimony to Northern Ireland’s highly-skilled workforce and strong pro-business climate. Cutting-edge innovations in the fields of cybersecurity, financial services, and biomedical sciences have helped position Northern Ireland as one of the UK’s most attractive regions for global investors. And, the United States is now the largest export market for Northern Ireland companies beyond the island of Ireland.Northern Ireland has also fast become a top tourism destination. Each day, thousands of tourists are discovering the ancient majesty of the Giant’s Causeway or exploring new attractions like Titanic Belfast. They’ve visiting Bushmills, the island’s oldest distillery, cycling along the Peace Bridge in Derry-Londonderry, or traversing the stories paths once taken by literary giants like CS Lewis, Seamus Heaney and, more recently,  Man Booker Prize-winner Anna Burns. According to Tourism Ireland, the region attracts upwards of . million visitors each year. And, the North American market is without question the most important, delivering an estimated % of all overseas visitors. With The Open Championship ing to Country Antrim’s Royal Portrush Golf Club in July, the many celebrations surrounding Derry-Londonderry’s th anniversary as a walled city, and the introduction of over  cruise ships to Belfast Harbour, now is the time to visit Northern Ireland.Belfast-born author CS Lewis once said that we meet no ordinary people in our lives. We’ve certainly found this to be true. On both sides of the Atlantic, we continue to meet so many special iniduals who make our partnership the present-day success it is.In this important week for transatlantic relations, we can reflect on our shared history as a foundation for our common values and interests.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.

All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
