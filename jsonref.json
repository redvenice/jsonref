Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

His quiet but compelling arguments about the importance of kids getting out more and connecting to nature might appear slightly surreal at a time when children the world over have been so long stuck indoors. Barkham tells us how much the area over which children roam has shrunk over three generations little can he have imagined when he wrote Wild Child how much more constrained their lives were about to become.But precisely because of these extreme conditions, Wild Child is a book that deserves to flourish. A generation of children and parents is learning the harshest possible lesson about how precious our right to roam really is. Never have we valued our green spaces more, as the passionate rows over the closure of city parks attests. Never have we thirsted so viscerally for the natural world with shops and entertainment venues closed, many of us have taken the time to appreciate the bulbs coming up, and the spring blossom on the trees. In the absence of cars, animals have been venturing into the streets, much to the delight of children everywhere (even if they have to watch it on YouTube).One of the many inspiring things about this book is Barkham’s insistence that you don’t need to live in the countryside to help your children enjoy and connect with nature often, the wild spaces in our cities can be more interesting and ecologically erse than intensively farmed agricultural land. His three children’s love for the natural world is formed in a cemetery in Norwich, where they pick blackberries, make friends with a stray cat, and one memorable day spot two muntjac. They dig a tiny pond in their back garden, and soon find it brimming with insects, snails, frogs and newts.With these gentle tales of nature at its most accessible, Barkham, who writes for the , is actually asking parents to think critically about our education system, with its narrow focus on academic achievement and testing. He volunteers in a “forest school” nursery, where he sees how an outdoor setting fosters children’s resilience, creativity and mental health. The heroes of this book are a new generation of outdoor educators, who are finding ways to reconnect children with nature in the face of a system that seems wilfully blind to its benefits.Thanks to our involuntary crash-course in home schooling, parents today will be becoming more tuned in to what works for our kids – and what doesn’t. Inevitably, this will inform what we want from schools it may open up possibilities for real change. Wild Child gives us some bold and inspiring ideas about what an education system that is truly fit for the 21st-century might look like.• Wild Child: Coming Home to Nature is published by Granta (RRP £16.99).

He suggested that the outcome was uncertain because economists were “dealing with something unprecedented so economic forecasting is not as precise as it might normally be”.Sunak had suggested as recently as last month that Britain could “bounce back” quickly thanks to the government’s support measures and the nation’s “fundamentally sound” economy prior to the crisis.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference in mid-April, he said “we can recover quickly and strongly and get our lives back to normal”.Referring to relatively weak levels of growth in Europe as lockdown measures were gradually lifted elsewhere, he added: “In all cases it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal, even once we’ve reopened currently closed sectors.”The emergency financial support unleashed by the Treasury, with a rapidly rising price tag worth tens of billions of pounds every month, is designed to minimise the lasting damage to the economy by helping companies to stay afloat and by keeping people in their jobs.However, Sunak warned that the depth of the Covid-19 recession and the length of time it could take for business activity to return to normal could hit the country’s productive capacity.“The longer the depth of the recession, I think everyone would agree – all economic forecasters and economists would agree – it is likely the degree of that scarring will be greater,” he said.He told the Lords committee: “I thought about a sectoral approach and in practice it would be very difficult to implement.“There’s an entire supply chain of those companies, which are in practice very hard to start to differentiate between those businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d84ab3ec12de9de1e68832b9cd10e77ee0ec62e/0_38_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf557479d38b685ba6e15df178a1255","title":"trust in airlines and holiday firms plummets says which coronavirus","story":"Public trust in the travel industry has plunged to an all-time low as airlines and holiday companies continue to deny and delay refunds for coronavirus cancellations, in breach of the law, according to new research from a UK consumer group.The latest consumer insight tracker from Which? reveals that trust in airlines and holiday companies has slumped from a net score of nine in February 2020 to -12 in May 2020, a fall of 21 points and the lowest in the seven years of collecting the data.Last month Which? said all of the UK’s major airlines and holiday companies were openly breaking the law by delaying refunds for cancelled trips or removing customers’ refund rights. The industry’s own estimates suggested that up to £7bn of travellers’ money was affected.Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said:“These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. With customers being told to either wait months for their money back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically.”He urged the industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to “come down strongly on any airlines found to be systemically denying or delaying refunds for cancelled flights and holidays” and for the government to set out how it will support the industry and restore trust in the sector.A spokesperson for Airlines UK said: “The impact of Covid-19 on UK aviation has been severe and truly unprecedented, with a huge increase in cancellations following travel restrictions and lockdowns around the world. Airlines continue to face a far higher volume of refund claims than normal. They are doing everything they can to work through the backlog and thank customers for their patience.”Separately, the UK’s independent watchdog said some rail commuters are waiting six weeks or more for a refund on their season ticket. The new survey from Transport Focus found that more than a third of passengers holding season tickets had not yet received a refund. In addition, six out of 10 passengers hadn’t been kept informed how long their claim could take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d59306a37370d4dc01d2a0c98090d0411cf3e3/0_48_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761f3424d80d68af35eabd0e68906a5b","title":"uk inflation tumbles energy clothes discounting covid 19 ftse pound business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as UK inflation hits its lowest level since 2016British justice secretary Robert Buckland says the government will try to hep Rolls-Royce and its staff.Asked about the firm’s plan to axe 9,000 job cuts, Buckland replied:“Clearly we will have to go to work with the employer to look at the options.“All of us will be looking not just at Rolls Royce but at the whole sector and the implications of this for the supply chains as well, let’s not forget them, to make sure we are doing everything we can in terms of plans and action to support what is a very high skilled part of our economy.”(thanks to Reuters for the quotes)Grim news: The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing Rolls-Royce to slash 9,000 jobs - or nearly a fifth of its workforce.Rolls-Royce, one of the jewels in UK manufacturing’s crown, is wielding the axe after seeing slumping demand for its jet engines due to the pandemic. With airlines suspending flights and mothballing planes, the Derby-based firm faces a serious crisis.Warren East, the chief executive, told the City:“This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and we must deal with it.Our airline customers and airframe partners are having to adapt and so must we.“Being told that there is no longer a job for you is a terrible prospect and it is especially hard when all of us take so much pride in working for Rolls-Royce.“But we must take difficult decisions to see our business through these unprecedented times.”Here’s the full story:Britain’s economy has a lot of problems right now, but inflation doesn’t appear to be one of them.With CPI almost halving last month, Equals Group chief economist Jeremy Thomson-Cook says weak economic demand will keep prices low:As we have noted in the past, you need to have demand to create inflation and, for now, there is little demand. Some will return as employees earnings recover and more businesses reopen allowing consumers to spend more on different sectors but, similar to the pace of the economy reopening, is likely to be slow.”Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics has spotted that this is the biggest drop in inflation in over a decade: All eyes now turn to the Governor of the Bank of England’s comments later today for signs of further action to boost economic activity. The Bank of England does have room to move, if it wishes, and Governor Bailey has already laid out the red carpet for lower interest rates, so we can be sure it’s at the front of his mind.Did your lockdown takeaway feel a little pricier this month? If so, you’re not alone.Prices at fast food outlets and takeaway services rose last month, the Office for National Statistics reports.Although food prices fell slightly, vegetable became pricier - possibly due to a switch to British potatoes.The largest upward contribution came from vegetables (including potatoes and tubers), where prices rose between March and April this year but fell between the same two months a year ago. This month’s price movements for vegetables could be a consequence of switching from internationally to domestically grown produce. Sky’s Scott Beasley points out that this partly eroded the benefits from cheaper oil.That means goods at the factory gate are actually cheaper than a year ago, suggesting consumer price inflation will remain low in the coming months.Although overall inflation fell, the cost of games rose in April -- as families scrambled to find interesting things to during the lockdown.There were further upward contributions of 0.07 percentage points from data processing equipment, principally computer software, and 0.05 percentage points from recording media, including CDs and DVDs purchased online and music downloads. Stock shortages drove up wool prices rose last month -- perhaps due to isolating Brits taking up knitting?For other clothing and accessories, most of the upward movement came from balls of knitting wool, where there were recoveries from sales and higher price comparable items as a result of stock shortages in some stores.Petrol prices hit their lowest level in four years, today’s inflation report shows:Petrol prices fell by 10.4 pence per litre between March and April 2020, to stand at 109.0 pence per litre, and diesel prices fell by 7.8 pence per litre, to stand at 116.0 pence per litre.In comparison, between March and April 2019, petrol and diesel prices increased by 3.8 and 2.3 pence per litre to stand at 124.1 and 133.0 pence per litre, respectively. Petrol prices were last lower in May 2016 (when a litre cost 108.7 pence), and the 10.4 pence per litre drop in petrol prices is the largest monthly fall since the current ultra-low sulphur or unleaded petrol series began in 1990. Good news for drivers! But there is a proviso. With millions of employees working from home, and non-essential driving curbed, few will have actually benefited much from cheaper fuel prices.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and businessBritain’s inflation rate has fallen to its lowest rate in over three and a half years last month, due to a drop in energy prices and discounting by shops desperate to sell stock during the Covid-19 lockdown.That’s its lowest rate since August 2016.Cheaper energy bills and petrol prices has a downward impact on the cost of living. Discounting was also a factor -- with clothes prices dropping last month during the lockdown:The larger number of items recorded as being on sale could reflect retailers’ efforts to encourage online purchases or potential difficulties as a result of the current economic situation. More to follow....Inflation data from the eurozone and Canada are expected to also show a sharp slowdown last month.David Madden of CMC Markets has the details:UK high street chain Marks \u0026amp Spencer is reporting results, updating the City on its performance during the lockdown.

Most boards probably grasped the point, but the job of the Treasury is to ensure the door is bolted firmly against the devious and the greedy. It’s astonishing it has taken this long for a bonus ban to be adopted.Tuesday’s other development reflects better on the Treasury. This was the boost from £50m to £200m in the size of loans granted under Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Scheme (CLBILS). But, again, one has to ask why the pleas of the “squeezed middle” of mid-sized companies – which is where the CLBILS facility is aimed – weren’t addressed earlier.Perhaps it’s because the squeeze could only be felt properly when the two other schemes were implemented. Even so, a quadrupling of the limit on CLBILS loans is more than a minor tweak it’s an admission, in effect, that money was failing to get to where it’s needed.The Treasury has been showered with praise for its rapid implementation of the furlough wage-support scheme – deservedly so. You do wonder, though, whether it needs a few hard-nosed business practitioners around the corridors. The bonus loophole, in particular, should have been closed weeks ago.Call it a small victory for small shareholders: Compass Group bothered to include them in its £2bn fundraising. Most companies, when raising cash in a hurry in recent weeks, have carved retail investors out of the share-placing process, thereby reinforcing the appalling message that the rights of inidual investors can be trampled upon in a crisis.In normal times, all shareholders are protected by pre-emption rights – the right to subscribe first when new shares are issued in a fundraising. It’s a key measure to ensure boards cannot grant favours to their chums or friendly institutions.The Financial Conduct Authority relaxed the rules during the pandemic for reasons everybody understands: companies will often need cash faster than a conventional rights issue would allow. But boards – until now – have mostly ignored the FCA’s parallel instruction that “soft” pre-emption rights should be incorporated where possible.Compass has shown it can be done. Small investors were able to participate via the PrimaryBid website at no extra cost and on equal terms. The solution is imperfect since the structure caps aggregate demand from retail investors at €8m under EU rules. But the key point is that the technology works.The issue is persuading boards to use it. Fear of the unknown, plus the presence of over-cautious lawyers, seem to have been the main stumbling block. The likes of Asos to WH Smith have simply bypassed small investors, often issuing shares at heavy discounts, the situation that most disadvantages those who are excluded.An impressive crew of City big-hitters – including Martin Gilbert, lately of Aberdeen Standard Life, and Anne Richards of Fidelity – wrote an open letter last month calling on companies to think of small investors and employee-shareholders. Well done, it changed the debate.Now Compass has set a good example. There should be no more woolly excuses elsewhere.EasyJet says it was hacked by “a highly sophisticated source”, which is what they all say. No company has ever confessed to being outwitted cyber-wise by a rank amateur trying his, or her, luck.Thus we will have to await the view of Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) on whether easyJet left its back door wide open.

Good of Prince Charles to put on his best rumpled gardening jacket and stand port-faced in his own garden telling us all to pick some fruit, then. I was just thinking, “You know what would really get me through the endless doom of this pandemic? Inexpertly grabbing potatoes out of the ground for absolute minimum wage.” And just like that, Charlie came through.In case you have missed this because you have been indoors desperately trying to do your job through a series of janky video calls while also juggling childcare and shopping for food despite the constant restrictions and doing a bit of exercise without going within two metres of another person while doing it – lockdown resembling a complicated fox–chicken–grain river-crossing task rather than a genuine public health measure – then what you’ve missed is this: Britain’s crops are under threat of mouldering on the vine, and you need to do something about it. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem because our agriculture industry has relied on seasonal migrant workers, but a combination of pandemic flight restrictions and years of government-sanctioned xenophobia have painted us into a bit of a corner, potato-and-pear wise. Hence, Prince Charles.The solution to this mooted at the start of lockdown was the Pick For Britain campaign – a flimsily rebranded version of world war two’s Women’s Land Army – for which British workers at a loose end are recruited en masse to get the strawberries in. Or that’s the theory, anyway: even with long-term furloughs and job losses, the number of people signing up to spend two entire seasons living in farm-provided accommodation (with the rent often deducted from your minimum wage pay) and waking up at 5am for some reason just to go face-to-face with some asparagus has been low. It’s estimated we need 80,000 extra workers tilling the fields. As reported in the Times, the work placement charity Concordia said of 50,000 people initially interested, 6,000 made it to interview, 1,000 rejected jobs that they were offered, and only 150 took up offers of work. Farming is no longer the Enid Blyton-esque jolly-good-day’s-work-and-a-pint-of-ale-for-your-trouble! it used to be. It’s just hard graft for very little money, possibly Britain’s most sacred tradition.That’s why Pick For Britain got the big guns involved: Waitrose’s very own in-house royal. “If we are to harvest British fruit and vegetables this year, we need an army of people to help,” the Prince said, one hand in his pocket. “In the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops. It will be hard graft but it is hugely important … People are needed who are genuinely going to commit. The phrase I have often heard is, ‘pickers who are stickers’.”There are some very loaded terms in there, aren’t there? Prince Charles saying “hard graft” alone should be enough to get the Robespierres among us fired up. The idea that he is parroting cool farming lingo that he has heard but never had to learn through work does rather put the (British-grown!) cherry on the sundae, too. Pick literally one brussels sprout out the ground, Prince Charles. Then I’ll join your little allotment army.Thing is, in a time of crisis like this, it’s actually a good opportunity for the royal family to show up and justify themselves to the non-believers. In good times, all they have to do is roll out some overly produced pageantry every couple of years – a bombastic flyovers-and-castles wedding, maybe, or show off a freshly swaddled heir – and the cheering commoners lap it up. But now we’ve all got to stay inside and bravely get over a once-in-a-generation catastrophe, what have we had from them? The Queen has sent two video messages from Windsor Castle, where she is holed up with a dozen staff and 100 budgerigars. Then Charles popped his head up to suggest we all get in the fields and toil. And that’s it. That’s your lot.What they’d give for Prince Harry right about now. Cheerfully sterilising his hands on TV. Tie tucked into his shirt, making a masked visit to a hospital. Explaining how he’s resisted boredom during a lifetime of furlough. Instead he’s laying low thousands of miles away so the Daily Mail no longer has anything to write about, and the British public remains resolutely uninspired.I’m not saying I want the royal family to do anything, exactly. I’m saying that after this period of conspicuous absence, surely we should have a performance review soon to see whether we really need them or not. At least get Philip out in the gardens at Windsor doing laps for the NHS, come on.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ffedcf0c766ad2badc7f8d98c5e1d479e13601/0_38_3480_2088/master/3480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5dedee015c134aa04e72bd0a92e993a","title":"no winners uk coronavirus blame game","story":" As the spats continue, the Commons science and technology committee paints a more nuanced picture of what went wrongAdvisers advise, as the old saying goes, but politicians decide. What it doesn’t add but should is that when those decisions go wrong, both sides are monumentally tempted to blame the other.And so it has proved with coronavirus. Ministers are increasingly openly attacking the scientific advice they were given, while experts both in and out of Sage are increasingly critical of the decisions subsequently made. Stand by for the fallout from the work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey declaring, when pressed to admit that ministers have handled the outbreak in care homes badly, that if the scientific advice was wrong then it’s unsurprising people think the resulting decisions were wrong. It’s human nature to lash out when lined up, fairly or unfairly, as the fall guy, yet the sight of mutual recriminations breaking out is downright alarming for a general public still wondering whether it’s safe to leave the house.So this week’s intervention from the Commons science and technology committee, which has spent weeks interrogating the key players by video link, is both timely and welcome in painting a more nuanced picture of what went wrong. Its letter to ministers zeroes in on the decision back in March to stop testing for coronavirus in the community and focus on hospital patients, which it correctly describes as “one of the most consequential made” in the crisis. Without widespread testing, Britain not only lacked insights into how fast the virus was spreading, but also set itself up for further horrors down the line. The failure to test workers moving between care homes may have helped the virus spread rapidly through some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Without mass testing and tracking systems to detect signs of new outbreaks, it’s hard to reopen schools or to lift the lockdown safely. So why, the committee wanted to know, didn’t Britain follow other countries and throw everything at testing?So far, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has taken most of the flak for that failure. Yet the committee identifies Public Health England as the slipperiest customer here, pointing out that nearly two months after it promised to show MPs the evidence on which the decision to stop community testing was based, it still hasn’t done so. Could it be, the MPs ask, that “no rigorous assessment was in fact made” of other countries’ approaches to testing? Greg Clark, the mild-mannered former Tory minister who chairs the committee, has openly argued that the decision was driven less by scientific considerations than by PHE’s lack of in-house capacity to carry out anything like enough tests and reluctance to accept help from an untried network of outside labs. That fits with tales of university and commercial labs queueing up to offer help, only to be ignored until Hancock eventually stepped in. His much-mocked target of 100,000 tests a day, delivered by a mix of private and public providers, prompted some dubious gaming of the figures but also delivered a belated surge in testing capacity without which we’d arguably be in even worse shape now. So why did all this seem to rely on what the committee calls a “personal initiative” by a rather lonely Hancock, in the teeth of hostile briefings from his own colleagues?“Just follow the science” has become a mantra for people who think that “science” equals incontrovertible proof, free of ideological bias or grubby political considerations. But faced with a novel virus, creating dilemmas unprecedented in modern advanced democracies, sometimes science doesn’t always offer a clear or correct conclusion. Political leaders following expert counsel will generally do better than ones who start experimentally dosing themselves with malaria drugs against medical advice, but sometimes even the best experts won’t have enough facts to reach a definite verdict. Behind closed doors there will inevitably be narrow judgment calls, and the assumptions on which they are made won’t always hold as more evidence emerges.In a crisis like this, the best decisions will be made by leaders flexible enough to change their minds when the facts change, rather than sticking grimly to a plan even as it’s overtaken by events. But people worried about being turned into scapegoats have a dangerously strong incentive not to raise conflicting evidence or to rock the boat. Advisers can’t advise freely if they think politicians are secretly gathering ammunition to use against them ministers develop a bunker mentality when constantly watching their backs. It may be too late now to stop the public blame game. But both sides should remember it’s a battle that ultimately nobody wins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b87a84ba40fa70b25257dd7d027e7266c38a71/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26fb3ed6034852f3bbfc3fb3fe4e9f78","title":"uk government pandemic","story":"We were second in the world for preparedness. Then Boris Johnson et al deliberately de-prepared usWe are trapped in a long, dark tunnel, all of whose known exits are blocked. There is no plausible route out of the UK’s coronavirus crisis that does not involve mass suffering and death. If, as some newspapers and Conservative MPs insist, the government eases the lockdown while the pandemic is still raging, the eventual death toll could be several times greater than today’s. If it doesn’t, and we spend all the warm months of the year in confinement, the impact on our mental and physical health, jobs and relationships could be catastrophic.We have been told repeatedly that the UK was unprepared for this pandemic. This is untrue. The UK was prepared, but then it de-prepared. Last year, the Global Health Security Index ranked this nation second in the world for pandemic readiness, while the US was first. Broadly speaking, in both nations the necessary systems were in place. Our governments chose not to use them.The climate modeller James Annan has used his analytical methods to show what would have happened if the UK government had imposed its lockdown a week earlier. Starting it on 16 March, rather than 23 March, his modelling suggests, would by now have saved around 30,000 lives, reducing the rate of illness and death from coronavirus roughly by a factor of five.But even 16 March would have been extraordinarily late. We now know that government ministers were told on 11 February that the virus could be catastrophic, and decisive action was urgently required. Instead, Boris Johnson told us to wash our hands and “go about our normal daily lives”.Had the government acted in February, we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been, as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment: weighing South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand against the UK, the US and Brazil. South Korea did everything the UK government could have done, but refused to implement. Its death toll so far: 263. It still has an occasional cluster of infection, which it promptly contains. By contrast, the entire UK is now a cluster of infection.While other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals, in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the UK’s lockdown, 18 million people arrived on these shores, of whom only 273 were quarantined. Even after the lockdown was announced, 95,000 people entered the UK without additional restrictions. In fact, on 13 March, the UK stood down even its own guidance, which had gently requested travellers from Italy and China to self-isolate. This decision, taken as other nations were stepping up their controls, seems baffling.Similarly, on 12 March, Johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking. A week later, the status of the pandemic was lowered, which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals, and could shift infectious patients into non-specialist care. Again, there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision.Exercise Cygnus, a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016, found that the impacts in care homes would be catastrophic unless new measures were put in place. The government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly. If this is correct, by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes, while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to move freely within and between them, it knowingly breached its own protocols. Tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection.In other words, none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity. They are de-preparations, conscious decisions not to act. They start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common: a refusal to frontload the costs. This refusal is common in countries whose governments fetishise what we call “the market”: the euphemism we use for the power of money.Johnson’s government, like that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, represents a particular kind of economic interest. For years politicians of their stripe have been in conflict with people who perform useful services: nurses, teachers, care workers and the other low-paid people who keep our lives ticking, whose attempts to organise and secure better pay and conditions are demonised by ministers and in the media.This political conflict is always fought on behalf of the same group: those who extract wealth. The war against utility is necessary if you want to privatise public services, granting lucrative monopolies or fire sales of public assets to friends in the private sector. It’s necessary if you want to hold down public sector pay and the minimum wage, cutting taxes and bills for the same funders and lobbyists. It is necessary if corporations are to be allowed to outsource and offshore their workforces, and wealthy people can offshore their income and assets.The interests of wealth extractors are, by definition, short term. They ert money that might otherwise have been used for investment into idends and share buybacks. They dump costs that corporations should legitimately bear on to society in general, in the form of pollution (the car and road lobbies) or public health disasters (soft drinks and junk food producers). They siphon money out of an enterprise or a nation as quickly as possible, before the tax authorities, regulators or legislators catch up.Years of experience have shown that it is much cheaper to make political donations, employ lobbyists and invest in public relations than to change lucrative but harmful commercial policies. Working through the billionaire press and political systems that are highly vulnerable to capture by money, in the UK, US and Brazil they have helped ensure that cavalier and reckless people are elected. Their chosen representatives have an almost instinctive aversion to investment, to carrying a cost today that could be deferred, delayed or dumped on someone else.It’s not that any of these interests – whether the Daily Mail or the US oil companies – want coronavirus to spread. It’s that the approach that has proved so disastrous in addressing the pandemic has been highly effective, from the lobbyists’ point of view, when applied to other issues: delaying and frustrating action to prevent climate breakdown pollution the obesity crisis inequality unaffordable rent and the many other plagues spread by corporate and billionaire power.Thanks in large part to their influence, we have governments that fail to protect the public interest, by design. This is the tunnel. This is why the exits are closed. This is why we will struggle to emerge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f10fa5e828b25cde6e3565e0761b63954974458/0_170_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dc48d8e1e178370b11c08d14e6a9fd","title":"british schools science children education testing tracing","story":"We need to get children back into education, but a locally managed approach using testing and tracing is the only wayThe big debate over the past few days has been whether it’s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren’t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one.Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test, trace, isolate”, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.The tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what’s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government’s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

Now, as a deep recession bites, conservation funding is likely to be further hit as donors and philanthropic funders channel money towards human health.During the austerity of the 2010s, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) suffered bigger cuts than any other department. Is there any reason to expect anything different this time around?Many environmentalists hope there is. The eight-week experience of lockdown has transformed public attitudes towards local green spaces, neighbourhood nature and wild species. Conservation charities are determined to mobilise this new interest.“We’re definitely in an unfrozen moment with being connected to nature,” said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB. “There’s this shift from consumer to citizen and all that goes with that in terms of community, place and sense of where you fit in the natural world and the global world. There’s a real opportunity to open that door which is tremendously exciting.”NGOs such as the Wildlife Trusts, with its popular #30dayswild campaign in June, whereby people pledge to undertake “random acts of wildness” each day, are encouraging public engagement in nature by showing its physical and mental health benefits. This will be key to ensuring that nature is seen as relevant by policymakers as society adapts to the coronavirus world.“Nature conservation charities need to be part of the green recovery,” said Julie Williams, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation. “It’s vital charities are welcomed into a post-Covid-19 recovery programme fully funded by a government that grasps that interest in nature which people are discovering. Could we work in greater partnership with Public Health England and the NHS to help with that health and wellbeing agenda which will be so important as we start to recover?”Butterfly Conservation and the RSPB are also developing more projects to boost urban wildlife, while the very white conservation sector is acutely aware it needs to become more erse to encourage a more widespread range of supporters.Transformed public appreciation for nature and green space may push government policy, but conservationists know their ability to reverse decades of bioersity losses ultimately depends on funding.The impact of austerity, according to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, is evident in cash-strapped government agencies such as Natural England and the Environment Agency. “Statutory agencies are no longer delivering even a minimally acceptable service,” said Shardlow.Although the government announced on Monday a £15m boost for Natural England this year, it will only make up a small amount of the cuts to the body over the past decade, during which funding dropped from £265m in 2008-2009 to a low of £86.5m in 2019-20. The key, says Shardlow, is to ensure the countryside is restored so it can perform ecological functions again – prevent flooding, for instance, and become rich once more in pollinators and other insects that provide natural pest control. The most cost-effective method is wildlife corridors so species can move through the landscape when challenged by climate change.Even in a deep recession, there is money. Under the EU, British farming received £3.4bn each year. The post-Brexit farm subsidy, the Environmental Land Management scheme, is still being developed. If reality matches its vision – public money not for unsustainable farming practices but for public goods, such as preventing flooding, improving soils or boosting bioersity – nature conservation could be transformed.“A lot of the £3.4bn does need to go to bioersity and the environment,” said Shardlow, who hopes that the new public mood will be matched by increased determination within Defra to resist further cuts.“Defra were very compliant last time,” said Shardlow. “I hope they’ve learned their lesson.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5601d6e287abb8d9533b007c9e9b37bec54a20a4/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fda2e8ad330d35e06d3c8017de71dc9","title":"how renewable energy could power britains economic recovery","story":"Harnessing power from sun, wind and sea could spur UK’s post-pandemic economy while tackling climate crisis, say expertsIn the first months of 2020 Britain relied on renewable energy like never before. The power generated by clean energy projects eclipsed fossil fuels for the first time ever, making up almost half the electricity used to keep the lights on.As the UK emerges from the financial maelstrom of the coronavirus pandemic, analysts, economists and environmentalists argue that the renewable energy industry could – and should – play a greater role, powering a green economic recovery too.The companies harnessing energy from the sun, wind and sea hold the potential to spur the UK’s economy by attracting billions in investment and creating thousands of green jobs across the UK’s regions while accelerating Britain’s climate ambitions.Britain’s clean energy sector proved this point in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis and the Confederation of British Industry calculated that the green economy contributed a third of the UK’s economic growth in 2010-11.The CBI report concluded that the so-called “choice” between going green or going for growth was a false one because green business was already on track to become a major pillar of Britain’s future growth.“After the last financial crisis, the UK’s green economy contributed substantially to new fiscal growth, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and finding new export markets around the world,” says Nathan Bennett of RenewableUK.“Once again, our industry will play a proactive role in getting the economy back on track, as we move out of lockdown. Renewables are a UK-wide opportunity to have a sustainable, forward-looking recovery and to boost productivity across the economy.”Today, much of the risk shouldered by renewable energy investors a decade ago has fallen away alongside plummeting technology costs. The UK’s commitment to pursuing a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 alongside its established financial support frameworks offer far more certainty to willing investors than in the past.The investment case for renewables is flattered further by the relative gloom shrouding investment opportunities elsewhere: fossil fuels have fallen from favour among a growing number of investors due to climate concerns and the collapse of global market prices for oil, gas and coal in recent weeks.Economists believe the renewable energy industry’s hard-fought financial clout combined with public policy support could create an economic and employment juggernaut capable of spurring the UK’s post-pandemic recovery while tackling the climate crisis too.“The climate emergency has not gone away,” says Bennett. “If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need to make sure our economy is sustainable and resilient in the long term.”Globally renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050, compared with a business-as-usual scenario, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).Irena said the coronavirus outbreak had exposed “the deep vulnerabilities of the current system” and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets.Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, one of the UK’s biggest renewable energy investors, says it is no overstatement to say that “the economic and environmental advantages of investment in a green recovery are aligned as never before”.Scottish Power is poised to invest billions in the UK’s renewable energy industry in the coming years, including an onshore wind renaissance after the government’s U-turn on blocking financial support for onshore turbines.The investment plans mapped out by Scottish Power and other renewable energy giants have remained intact through the pandemic while oil majors have slashed billions from their spending plans and warned that job losses are likely later in the year.“The best thing about it is that you’re investing for the next 40 years in clean energy,” says Anderson. “There’s a whole load of other infrastructure work you could do in the UK, but the thing about investing in renewables is that it is just as good at creating jobs and kickstarting the economy – but the added benefit is that you’d be tackling climate change at the same time.”The Social Market Foundation believes there could be long-term benefits for workers too. The thinktank called last week for the government to help train those left jobless by the looming financial recession to work in the low-carbon economy. The government could spur the economy, accelerate its climate ambitions and help kickstart social mobility, it said.The “net zero” industries, which include clean energy, electricity networks, car-charging infrastructure and energy efficiency, could help provide new jobs for many of the 1.4 million people expected to be left unemployed following the pandemic.The SMF has estimated that in some parts of the country, the number of green jobs that need to be filled to meet the climate goal is equal to half the number of people who were unemployed before the coronavirus crisis.“There is a pressing need to provide better support for those who lose work in this crisis,” says Kathryn Petrie, the SMF’s chief economist. “But also an opportunity. A well-designed guarantee of work and training could protect people from lasting damage, support UK skills and support the greening of the economy.”But the potential upsides could still slip away without decisive action to grasp the opportunity to reset the UK economy on a sustainable green foundation.The International Energy Agency’s executive director, Fatih Birol, has called on governments to devise stimulus plans that put the green energy agenda at the heart of the economic recovery. Anderson says there is not a moment to lose.“This is our message to the government: now is the time to do it. Investors are very keen to push money this way, and into these projects.

During the first days of lockdown the bearded, ghostly white creatures wandered down from their north Wales clifftop home into the town of Llandudno and made headlines around the globe.Now the National Trust is reporting that emboldened wildlife, from raptors and warblers to badgers, otters and even orcas, appear to be enjoying the disappearance of humans from its gardens, castles and waterways across the UK.The charity is asking people to be aware that when they eventually return to the countryside they should take care not to disturb wildlife they would not usually expect to encounter.Reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset, English partridges rootling around an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley Park in west London, having not been heard there for 20 yearsDavid Brown, the National Trust’s ecologist at Corfe Castle, said: “This is the first time peregrines have nested here since the 1980s. With the site the quietest it has ever been, the great curtain walls are an ideal spot for these birds, which look for isolated and inaccessible places to build a nest. Amongst all the uncertainty, it has been heartening to see nature colonising the landscape in our absence.”At Plas yn Rhiw, a manor house on the Llyn Peninsula in north Wales, stoats, weasels and hares have come in from the woodland to explore the gardens, which are usually filled with visitors.In Norfolk, a buzzard managed to get into the orangery at Felbrigg Hall and happily tucked into its lunch there. At the Ashridge estate in Hertfordshire, the rare sound of a grasshopper warbler was recorded in a typically busy dog-walking area.Little owls have also been making their presence felt at Ham House in south-west London, venturing into the garden from the adjacent river meadows.Some creatures appear to be missing human visitors, however.Jackdaws, which enjoy feeding on scraps of food dropped by people, for example, have not returned to Ham House since the lockdown. And with no audience to show off to, the peacocks at Powis Castle, in mid-Wales, have taken to following gardeners on their daily rounds.But the overall picture is positive. A family of badger cubs has been spotted playfully exploring the Mount Stewart estate in Northern Ireland by daylight, while a rare albino badger has been seen in the woods at Cliveden, in Berkshire.On Friday, two male orca were seen in Strangford Lough, in Northern Ireland. They are believed to have belonged to a pod of just eight animals, the UK’s only resident group. They spend much of their time in the Inner and Outer Hebrides and the western seaboard of Scotland. It may be that the quietness of the lough during lockdown tempted them in.Otters have been spotted enjoying the quiet at Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire and at Mount Stewart in County Down, with those at the Northern Ireland site travelling from the lough to explore the lake in the grounds of the neoclassical house.Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: “It has only been eight weeks but wildlife seems to be enjoying the breathing space. With less traffic and fewer people, we’ve heard deafening levels of birdsong and seen famous monuments and formal gardens colonised by wildlife.”While its properties are temporarily closed, the trust is working on its reopening plans.As it begins to welcome back visitors to its countryside and coastal sites, however, the conservation charity is asking people to be particularly careful not to disturb wildlife that may have moved into typically busy areas.McCarthy added: “As the lockdown begins to be eased, we all need to play our part to ensure that this wildlife remains undisturbed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf64a2273c23896b6449c5e1ea542a17629482d4/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028f9a1bc0cb45b643978a1d057eb2e","title":"relax to the sounds of british wildlife","story":"Our interactive takes you on an audiovisual journey through a lush forest across the course of a dayAs the coronavirus crisis and lockdown still thwart most of our social plans, many of us are looking to escape feelings of cabin fever and the perennial cycle of bad news by reconnecting with nature.Perhaps you are taking more notice of your natural surroundings these days, or you have seen animals move into the spaces that humans have vacated.But what if you could enjoy some of that natural beauty from the safety of your home?Our interactive experience takes you on a journey through a lush forest in spring and lets you listen to the sounds of iconic British wildlife. The samples were collected by prolific wildlife recordist Lawrence Shove in the 1960s and 1970s and provided to the  by the British Library. This interactive is best experienced with headphones. As we wake up to an early start around sunrise, many birds are already up and singing at full throat to stake off their territory and attract potential mates.The nightingale likes to hide in thick brush when delivering its powerful song. It can be heard between April and June and is most active at dawn and dusk.The robin is a pugnacious little bird that will try to maintain its territory throughout the year.Fallow deer often stalk the forest at dawn before lying down to ruminate during the day. They give off powerful bellows to establish dominance or signal alarm. Around midday, the forest gets quieter as birds and other small animals are cautious not to attract the attention of predators. But not all animals fall silent … The woodpecker’s distinctive drumming can often be heard during the day. The woodpecker uses its drumming like other birds use their song: to attract mates, defend a territory or summon help.The great tit is known for its vast repertoire of short calls.The grey squirrel spends much of the day scavenging for nuts, fruit and fungi. It will give off loud alarm calls when spotting a predator. As the sun goes down, more animals can be heard stirring in the undergrowth again.  The red fox is an extremely adaptive species not afraid of exploring gardens or farmland. Its diet includes rodents, insects, fruit and vegetables – and sometimes scraps found in the garbage. The elusive pine marten is a close relative of the weasel and critically endangered in England and Wales. It is a stealthy, acrobatic hunter that likes to venture out at dusk. The mole is active for about four hours at a time and then rests for a similar amount of time. It makes shrill chirping noises when alarmed. Many animals awake only after nightfall to move or hunt under cover of darkness. The badger emerges from its underground home after dusk to feed on worms, birds’ eggs or small animals. It is a highly social animal and communicates through chortling sounds. The tawny owl glides almost soundlessly through the night as it looks for prey. The male gives off an eerie hoot when attempting to court a nearby female. Finally, we hear a hedgehog snuffling as it moves through the undergrowth. The hedgehog can also become surprisingly noisy during its lengthy mating ritual. If you enjoyed this interactive, you might find that some of these animals live right on your doorstep.If you decide to exercise outdoors, remember that the government’s coronavirus advice is to stay at home as much as possible. The Welsh and Scottish governments are urging the public to avoid all unnecessary travel. National park authorities in England are telling people not to rush back to beauty spots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7abe11ad9412ff211ed54b54ec8fed4e3d0c4de2/349_138_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0e379eaa5918ac363d7366ea0b8604","title":"how netflix is reviving forgotten film flops","story":"As we stream more than ever, the surprising success of some maligned B-movies clues us into what people want to watchNews last week that Woody Allen’s latest, the Amazon-disowned A Rainy Day in New York, was the world’s number one film at the box office spread fast, mainly because of its inherent absurdity. Allen, a figure associated more with critical acclaim than commercial success, is currently outgrossing Pixar’s Onward with a film that might never see a US release, a bizarro turn of events that felt indicative of what’s become a very surreal year in film.The overwhelming majority of global cinemas remain closed due to the ongoing pandemic and so Allen’s blockbusting triumph was the result of having just opened in South Korea, a country that’s far ahead in the knotty process of restarting its economy. Without real box office numbers to analyse, we’ve been forced to look elsewhere to find out what films people are watching and with its unparalleled dominance in the world of streaming, the best place to look is of course Netflix. While the platform still refrains from any regular form of data-sharing, it drops the odd humblebrag when something hits big and has also implemented a daily top 10 feature which allows us to at least see what shows and films are the most watched even if we don’t know how many people are watching.While the list is often predictably led by the streamer’s latest high-profile original (in large part a result of it receiving the most aggressive on-site promotion), what’s become far more interesting to observe is the number of forgotten B-movies that have been nestling alongside, granted a second life for an audience arguably far larger than they’ve ever had before. In recent weeks, the US top 10 has included teen horror House at the End of the Street, action thrillers Sleepless and Den of Thieves, fact-based drama Soul Surfer, Single White Female rip-off The Roommate and sci-fi adventure Lockout. Each of these films shares a number of characteristics: a recognisable star lead, a wide theatrical release and a middling or underwhelming performance at the box office. So they land on Netflix and are met with a vague awareness of the film but with a stronger familiarity attached to the actors propping them up, the kind of combination that time and again has led to rental success in the past. Take 2017 for example. What was the most rented title of the year? Wonder Woman? Rogue One? Thor: Ragnarok? Nope, it was the Ben Affleck thriller The Accountant, a film that did solid business theatrically but blew up at home, consumers perhaps waiting for the most fitting price point for a film that didn’t demand the big-screen experience.With Netflix, the psychology of what to watch is obviously very different, with no cost attached to each inidual film, but with so much choice and with it being just one of many widely used services, strong viewership for every new addition is by no means a guarantee (higher-profile recent adds to US Netflix, including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, District 9, Back to the Future, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Artist, all failed to make a showing in the chart). What’s revealing is to then see what does cause people to click en masse and how a mostly forgotten film that might be part of a cheap bulk acquisition can gain a new fanbase. An early sign of this came in 2015 when the Netflix arrival of A Very Brady Sequel led to an unusual viral afterlife for a comedy released almost 20 years earlier. The film, a well-received, tongue-in-cheek sequel to an update of the earnest family TV show, made less then $22m at the US box office leading to the third film heading straight to the small screen. Its cultural impact was minimal but within weeks of landing on Netflix two decades later, it was responsible for a flurry of memes from an audience who were most likely not born when it came out (Sure, Jan remains in rotation now).We haven’t seen quite the same social media explosion just yet for any of the titles mentioned but without the standard May release schedule in place, a thirst for the new is stronger than ever. So now, rather than rushing to see Fast \u0026amp Furious 9 or Black Widow, millions of Americans are instead watching House at the End of the Street, a poorly reviewed 2012 thriller starring a pre-Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence. Shot in 2010 and then shelved for two years, the film eventually did average business on release but was promptly forgotten about as Lawrence’s star continued to ascend. But renewed interest (it’s been in the US top 10 since being added to Netflix on 7 May and trended on Twitter soon after) has led to film sites, eager for content, to post a deluge of clickbait pieces from Looper’s The ending of House at the End of the Street explained to Screen Rant’s House At The End Of The Street 2: Will It Happen? (spoiler: it won’t). The Jamie Foxx thriller Sleepless has seen a similar trajectory, lingering in the most watched for weeks after making only $20m in the US on release in 2017 (see: We Got This Covered’s An Underrated Jamie Foxx Thriller Has Been Surprisingly Popular On Netflix).What’s encouraging for Netflix is that these successes have emerged from smaller companies, rather than big studios. The reason this matters right now is that the increasingly fractured nature of streaming means that inidual studios are taking back their own movies for their own platforms. Pre-existing deals mean this hasn’t all happened automatically but soon, Disney+ will house all Disney films and some family-friendly Fox titles, Hulu will have other Fox movies including Searchlight, Peacock will take Universal films, HBO Max will have Warner and New Line titles and CBS All Access will take Paramount catalogue. It’s one of the reasons Netflix has been acquiring and producing so many “original” films to stock up, to fill up their homepage with enough reasons to subscribe before the great drought begins. This surge of clicks for films briefly leased from less prestigious companies, those unlikely to launch their own platforms, not only suggests to Netflix that there’s life outside of the big studios but also helps them to figure out the formula for their own future original films.The platform’s two biggest success stories of late – Spenser Confidential, starring Mark Wahlberg, and Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth (now, allegedly, Netflix’s biggest two film premieres ever) – fall in line with the aforementioned B-movie hits: reviews were tepid and plotting was simple but both were anchored by a recognisable star and millions were happy to press play without further expense. Given the muted box office clout of both actors outside of franchise fare (Wahlberg stumbled with Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day and Mile 22 while Hemsworth couldn’t turn Bad Times at El Royale or In the Heart of the Sea into hits), it’s unlikely these films would have made a dent theatrically yet scored over 85 million and 90 million online viewers apiece. Netflix has responded to the success by giving the green light to an Extraction sequel, another Wahlberg action film described as a “blue-collar 007” and an action-heavy franchise-starter for another fallen star, Jessica Alba. Rather than wait for B-movies to receive a second life years after a big-screen release, Netflix is cutting out the middle man."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c388f4676382a419f25c94f991070b47ead27f07/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1fe0f366da622c3f2167230414217b38","title":"michel piccoli a life in pictures","story":"The prolific actor Michel Piccoli, who has died aged 94, acted in dozens of films for virtually every major French director across seven decades, including Godard, Malle and Rivette here are some of the highlightsPeter Bradshaw on Michel Piccoli: a fierce, strong performer who became the object of cinephile fan-worship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206a42f178655b73d1e49824b7707943709d7102/0_1534_4905_2941/master/4905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd96cb4d84e9bd31b09c15fca748d557","title":"nigel slaters recipe for baked tomatoes with tuna and borlotti","story":"Cut 450g of assorted tomatoes in half and put them in a mixing bowl.

Drain a large tin of sustainable tuna and put the tuna in the middle of the beans.

I like to serve bread with this supper, maybe ciabatta or a baguette, thinly sliced, toasted and drenched in the juices from the pot.Tomatoes aside, this is very much a store-cupboard supper. Use canned chopped tomatoes if that is what you have. Cannellini, flageolet or haricot beans will work instead of the borlotti. If tuna isn’t your thing, you could turn this into a slightly different, and indeed vegetarian, dish by using a jar of preserved artichoke hearts in its place – in which case I would add some green olives, too.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35b741cf1b34308b33c966f449d1dcfe54c31bd3/135_162_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f9a5634003caa1023085d9447824ee1","title":"harrogate league two national league anxious wait promotion football league","story":"Manager Simon Weaver believes EFL rules mean the team second in the National League will be promoted but a new stand and replacing a 3G pitch have to wait for nowWork has resumed on bringing Harrogate’s Wetherby Road stadium up to Football League standards but who pays for the new Family Stand, and who plays in front of it next season, are only two of the uncertainties that surround the North Yorkshire club. Their day of reckoning is approaching.Harrogate were second in the National League when the remainder of the season was cancelled on 22 April because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last Friday League Two clubs voted to curtail the rest of their season but to retain automatic promotion and play-offs but, crucially as far as Harrogate are concerned, suspend relegation to the National League. The decision has not been ratified by the EFL board and will be discussed at its meeting on Wednesday.The repercussions of League Two ending without relegation may not be so costly for the National League leaders, Barrow, who, while also fretting over what comes next, could take the league position created by Bury’s expulsion in August. For Harrogate, however, there is only doubt over the second promotion spot and no clear route out yet. The EFL board’s decision will have profound consequences.“We were four points behind Barrow and due to play them at home a few weeks after the pandemic erupted, but what might have happened is just words now,” says Harrogate’s manager, Simon Weaver. “It’s not a Liverpool situation with one team 25 points clear it is four points. We were relishing that battle with Barrow but if the play-offs are out of the question then the best two teams should be rewarded.Weaver had taken Harrogate close to a second promotion when the National League season was abandoned. He has devoured the EFL’s rules and regulations, and every statement regarding resolutions, ever since.“We are confident that two clubs will go up because of the EFL rulebook and the agreement that was made with the league several years ago,” he says. “The rulebook states that the second team to go up is either the runners-up or the winners of the play-offs, but the chances of the play-offs taking place are slim.” The National League has said the play-offs are “under careful consideration”.Harrogate’s ambitions for the Football League are mired in uncertainty. The new Family Stand will increase the capacity to more than 5,000 and meet the Football League’s minimum requirement for League Two of 1,000 seats. But a £400,000 Football League grant for the redevelopment is only payable on promotion. To dig or not to dig is also a question facing the Harrogate board.“We receive the Football League grant only if we go up,” says Weaver. “But we can’t not do the work. We need to meet all the criteria to go into the Football League and that will also involve digging up our pitch because it is 3G. Do we wait to dig it up or gamble on laying a new grass pitch that will be ready for next season now?“And sooner rather than later we have to plan for the players we need. Fortunately, we planned ahead with player contracts. We only had four players out of contract and one of them has re-signed. It wasn’t nice to have to release the other three via a Zoom call but at least it wasn’t 11.”The price of promotion, and of being denied it, is stark to a club of Harrogate’s size. “We received £90,000 for winning promotion to the National League,” Weaver says. “For promotion to the Football League we are looking at around £1m, including the £400,000 grant for the new stand. Forgive the pun but it would be ground-breaking for us. Plus we would have extra revenue from the capacity increase and TV money. This is massive for us and a massive decision. We need it to be positive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f15853998a1220f3501caaa974a3d6306d454ee/0_51_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0362812eccd9402d95e0671ff2c49d9d","title":"have any football champions gone out of business faster than hallelujah fc the knowledge","story":"Plus: long gaps between players winning the same trophy, the ultimate leisurely pro and Demeaco Duhaney’s ups and downs“Hallelujah FC, who were the first professional club in South Korea, won the inaugural K-League in 1983,” writes Kári Tulinius. “Two years later they had ceased to be professional, and continued as an amateur club until 1998, when they were dissolved. Despite the name, they were never resurrected. Has any professional club been permanently dissolved so soon after being champion?”It turns out there are plenty of examples of champions who have tumbled into oblivion in double-quick time. “There are quite a few in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states,” writes Jack Mey. “Unirea Urziceni won the league title in Romania in 2009. By the end of the 2010-11 season, they had been relegated and were subsequently wound up. In Estonia, Lantana Tallinn won the league title twice, in 1996 and 1997. The club was disbanded in 1999. Over the border in Latvia, FK Vindava from the city of Ventspils, won the Latvian Championship in 2007 before being dissolved in 2009. FK Ekranas were one of Lithuania’s most successful clubs, they won the last of seven titles in 2012 and were wound up in 2014.”John Morrow takes us to the Emerald Isle. “It has been a regular occurrence in the volatile League of Ireland, especially in Cork, where the predominance of Dublin clubs in the league meant crippling travel expenses. Cork United emerged in 1940 after the dissolution of Cork City (a separate entity to the current League of Ireland members) and took the league by storm, winning three consecutive titles and adding two more in 1945 and 1946. A mere two years later, however, and they too were gone. Dolphin were a Dublin club who won the title in 1935 but resigned in 1937, unable to compete with the more established city clubs.”Dean Whearty has another League of Ireland example. “Sporting Fingal – founded in 2007 and dissolved in 2011 – had 965 days between their first and last match. In that time, they won the domestic cup, won promotion to the top ision (finishing fourth in their one and only season) and lost a dramatic Europa League tie 6-4 to Maritimo.”But Dave Mellinger can offer us two champion clubs who disappeared so quickly their crowning wins were mere whispers in the wind. “In 2009 in the top tier of US WPS, the Los Angeles Sol won the regular season, which ended on 9 August. This being the States, there was also a playoff winner, but we’ll ignore them for now. Before the next season started, the team was dissolved – on 28 January 2010, only 172 days later. The Sol were tortoises, however, compared to what happened next. The following season, FC Gold Pride won the playoff championship on 26 September 2010 – they had won the regular season shortly before – and folded, never to be resurrected, on 16 November of the same year. That’s a hare-like 51 days between the championship and dissolution.”“Edwin van der Sar won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and Manchester United in 2008. Has any other player had a longer gap between winning the same major trophy?” asks Todd Bonzalez.Geoff Edwards has found another former Manchester United goalkeeper who can pip Van der Sar: “Jimmy Rimmer was (an admittedly unused) substitute to Alex Stepney in 1968 and Aston Villa’s No 1 in their 1982 European Cup victory, so a gap of 14 years.”Jonathan Churchill offers up an FA Cup winner, pointing out that David O’Leary won it with Arsenal in 1979 and again in 1993, but Dirk Maas has found a winner in longevity’s Paolo Mandini. The Milan legend won the Intercontinental Cup in 1989 and 1990, then waited 17 years to win it again, when called the Fifa Club World Cup.“After he was mentioned last week, I looked up Hans Segers and was interested to see that he had played Premier League football with Wimbledon, Conference football with Woking, then Premier League football again with Tottenham,” notes Ricardo Sentulio. “Can any other player claim to have dipped even lower to play a competitive match between spells in a top flight?”“Not quite what you are looking for, but Demeaco Duhaney made his professional debut in the Premier League for Huddersfield in a 1-0 win against Wolves in 2019,” begins Richard Askham. “He was substituted at half-time with an injury that kept him out until this season. His second professional appearance was on loan for Boston United in National League North, five down from the top flight (four from where Town are now). He’s played once in the Championship (against Leeds) for Town since returning from Boston. If he isn’t selected again in 2019-20 and Town are relegated, his first appearance in League One would be a proper (albeit unwanted) record. Surely a record of sorts and a question in its own right, perhaps? Please ask if anyone can ‘beat’ Demeaco’s ups and downs, (with respect to Boston, who were in the same ision as Town in 2003-04).”“After an obscure discussion I ended up on the Wikipedia page of former Liverpool and Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad who, it says, made 39 appearances in a 16-year career,” begins Neal Robb. “I thought this must be a record and checked back to see if this had been a topic and I see from this Knowledge article on the fewest appearances in a professional career that Stuart Taylor’s 86 was the lowest found.”It would appear you do indeed have a new leading leisurely pro, Neal. Transfermarkt has Arphexad’s career appearances at 46 and Soccerbase at 49. He “played” for 16 years so either of those figures make Taylor look like an overworked stopper. Despite Arphexad’s aversion to actually starting games, he can still boast these medals:“Steven Gerrard famously kissed a mobile camera after scoring at Old Trafford but has anyone else done this before him?” asks Tim Underwood.“At Porto, Paulo Ferreira won the Uefa Cup in 2003 and the Champions League in 2004. Later, at Chelsea, he won the Champions League in 2012 and the Europa League (aka the Uefa Cup) in 2013. Are there any other cases of players winning these two trophies in successive years, twice?” wonders Benjamin Dom.“Which two clubs have done the most transfer business with each other?” enquires John Ruddock.“Has a player has ever featured in all their team’s wins in a season, but none of the losses?

Now government-backed, highly mobile and without mercy or conscience, Janjaweed rebels had answered the president’s call-to-arms, bolstering support for the Sudanese army’s counter-insurgency to ethnically cleanse the uprising of Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribal minorities which were aligned with the Sudan Liberation MovementArmy (SLMA) and Justice Equality Movement groups.Following aerial bombardment by the Sudanese army, Janjaweed rebels spilled through the villages. They killed, raped, looted and burned – and they abducted boys as child soldiers.It is widely documented that children affected by the Darfur genocide were subjected to all of the UN’s “six grave violations against children during armed conflict”: killing or maiming of children recruitment or use of child soldiers rape and other forms of sexual violence against children abduction of children attacks against schools or hospitals and the denial of humanitarian access to children.During the genocide, people under siege in the remote villages of Kebkabiya, north Darfur, home to predominantly Fur and Zaghawa tribes, woke to the sound of gunfire and the screams of villagers. Khadija Abdullah, 35, witnessed her husband Ahmed leave their home never to return. He had gathered with the men of the village. All they had to defend themselves were primitive agricultural tools and they were killed where they stood. Families that were able escaped into night with just the clothes they wore.Displacement during the conflict often occurred either in anticipation of attacks or, for Khadija, after the event that left her grieving, terrified and fleeing with her three children to safety.Sudan’s former administration both instigated the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and prevented its resolution. Delivering aid in Sudan has not been without challenge. Strategies to delay, limit and deny access by aid agencies to civilians in need are well documented.Today the security situation in the Darfur region remains unstable. More than 8 million people are in need of assistance. Urgent humanitarian intervention and protection of the most marginalised is required to prevent paralysing the generations that follow.Sumbul Rizvi, the UN refugee agency’s principal adviser on internal displacement, who was stationed in a remote West Darfur field office from 2007 to 2009, says humanitarian intervention for the most vulnerable, including separated and orphaned children, was part of the UNHCR response. “We work with affected populations and their host communities to provide shelter, coordinate the work of partner agencies, and ensure that IDP camps and sites receive the attention they deserve.”“The protection of children cannot be in isolation of their communities, who may continue to be exposed to risks even in displacement,” she says. “Ensuring protection and solutions for IDPs in Darfur is vital for a peaceful future for Sudan.”International NGO Qatar Charity has worked with Sudan’s governments past and present to protect the fatherless or orphaned young people in Darfur through its “Rofaqaa” sponsorship programme since the conflict began. The scheme to date has ensured the provision of shelter, food, clean water, access to education and protection to more than 3,500 orphaned children in Darfur and 12,244 across Sudan.However Sudan’s social welfare ministry estimated that orphaned or fatherless children of conflict numbered 45,000 in 2015 in South Darfur alone.Mohamed Al Ghamdi, director of external affairs for Qatar Charity, says: “Our child protection strategy supports the continued UN-led international development plan for Darfur, by implementing a large number of projects for the reconstruction of the region in partnership with the UN Development Program and the Qatar Fund for Development … with the aim of promoting peace and development.” Rahman Ali, 16, was only months old when he was carried to safety in the arms of his mother, Khadija, from their besieged village in North Darfur where his father was killed. For 10 years he was a beneficiary of the Rofaqaa programme. He hopes to contribute to promoting the peace that he says his country so badly needs.However a key prerequisite for long-term peace and stability in Darfur is disarmament.The Darfur peace agreements of 2006 and 2011 both required the disarmament and demobilisation of Janjaweed militia along with SLMA and various rebel groups. While these were seen as steps in the right direction, to deliver successful demilitarisation there must be significant provision for alternative livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants. Should this not happen, the risk remains of re-recruitment to other factions, perpetuating a cycle of insecurity.Indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity and deposed, convicted and incarcerated in a coup in Khartoum last year, former president Omar al-Bashir’s tenure has been marked by murder and genocide and left a legacy of families traumatised and destitute.The pro-democracy revolution of 2019 brought change to Khartoum, and if Sudan’s transitional government can resist being drawn into foreign conflicts and instead provide a realistic prospect of return for the displaced, then perhaps establishing a new roadmap for peace in the region may be possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14108b622eaa9382d57bc3576626848dc431685f/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6ceb90375fa99b425ad9c1e35c4f75","title":"grammar correct language","story":"If you find yourself doing it, consider this: are you genuinely attempting to help, or just trying to gain the upper hand?After Sunday’s episode of reality TV drama 90 Day Fiancé, people were left with an important question: is it ever OK to correct someone’s grammar?The show follows long-distance couples in a pressure cooker: when the foreign lovers of American citizens move to the US, with just 90 days to decide whether to get married before their visas run out. Sunday’s episode saw couple Stephanie Matto and Erika Owens hash out what went wrong in their failed relationship, and some viewers suggested that a screenshot showing an exchange between them might sum their problems up.“I’m so sad about this,” Owens texts Matto, seen in a WhatsApp chat. Then she adds: “I feel so lead on.”There are a select number of situations in which someone is allowed to correct someone else’s grammar: if you are a teacher if you are paid to correct grammar or proofread work or if you are a parent. Then it’s acceptable to say: “Actually, it’s you’re, not your.”In some cases, the question is blurrier. Perhaps you’re learning a new language, and you have either asked, or the other person assumes, that you’d appreciate not looking silly every time you get something wrong. If you are a waiter and your boss corrects your grammar because they’re worried about the impression you give off, or if you’re the nanny to someone’s children and the parents are worried you’ll impart incorrect wisdom … then it becomes a little more subjective.Some might say that if good grammar isn’t in the job description, it shouldn’t count it could certainly end up feeling like an overreach of someone’s power if they continue to correct you.But if you correct someone’s grammar in the middle of an argument, even if you are in any of the above positions, you are most likely wrong. Sure, they may have meant fewer, rather than less. But it is both a power move and a way of detracting from what the person is saying, of putting them down instead of listening to the substance of their argument. Slate summed up exactly what’s wrong with this when it coined the term “language bully” in 2013. There’s nothing wrong with knowing more than others, writer Matthew Malady wrote, but “those who use their advanced knowledge to embarrass or humiliate others are the absolute worst”.If correcting someone else’s grammar is routine for you, consider this: are you genuinely trying to help, or are you just trying to gain the upper hand? Are you listening to what the other person is saying, or simply looking for an excuse to show them that they are wrong? And really, does it matter that they confused their and there, or could you let that one go this time?

To nobody’s surprise more than mine, my pandemic experience so far has been fine. More than fine.As someone who has lived alone and worked from home for years, I expected that in some ways self-isolation would be easier for me than for others. However, as someone with major depression, the lack of human contact and a sharp decline in work also spelled potential disaster. But disaster never came. Or hasn’t come (I shouldn’t count my chickens). I mean, I’m anxious about money, worried about the refugees I advocate for and terrified for all humankind, but that’s all in a normal day for me. Compared with the utter trainwreck forecast by my mental health history, I’m going well. Killing it, even.Part of the answer is that I’ve continued seeing my sister and her family on limited, socially distanced occasions throughout lockdown. As boring and entitled as it sounds, daily yoga and exercise help too. But perhaps the biggest reason for my shockingly stable mood is increased contact with my friends, near and far.Before coronavirus (BC) I only saw a handful of friends with even semi-regularity. With jobs, kids, sea-changes and sheer laziness, phone calls are hard. One-on-one catch-ups harder, and group events near impossible. And though I’m super close to my family, when I’m not dating someone I can feel quite isolated. Even when I am dating someone. The virus has changed that. Even though I’ve hardly seen a soul in-person for months, in a way I’ve never felt less alone.Ever since this collective nightmare started, I’ve barely gone a day without a video call or two. There’s no way to say that without sounding like I’m bragging about having friends – so just know, I know.In the past, self-consciousness has seen me decline all video calls, personal and professional. It’s seen me decline a lot of things, actually – I barely let anyone take my photo. I’d make excuses about my laptop camera being broken or the wifi being too unreliable, or I’d just flat out say no. But, through self-administered immersion therapy, I faced my fears and it’s opened up a whole new world.Hanging out with mates without having to leave the house or wear pants is amazing. And it only took a global pandemic for me to realise this.Now seeing my phone light up with an incoming FaceTime call no longer paralyses me with dread. I’m having regular Zooms with friends all over the world. I’ve had cocktail parties, we’ve done trivia and group yoga together and taken live dance classes. I’ve advised on outfits, read bedtime stories and had Passover with my extended family.Embracing video-telephony has enabled me to be there for my friends in a more present and meaningful way. When a friend was having relationship problems, we had a video call. I felt a thousand times more helpful than I would have had we just texted, which is what we would have done before.When another friend lost her job, an all-too-familiar tale right now, a group of us were able to cheer her up, at least briefly, by being silly on Zoom. It’s a strange comfort to know that if I break – still a very real possibility – they’ll watch me cry and do stupid dances in their underwear for me too.Of course, there’s no substitute for spending time with your favourite people in the same place. And as the rules relax, I’m excited to see my friends without the NBN causing their faces to freeze mid-sentence. I’m excited about hugs. I’m excited about patting dogs, playing with my godsons and sharing meals.If I could go back in time and reverse the decisions that got us into, worsened and prolonged this horrific mess, I would. Especially all the ones to do with cruise ships, the sick bays of the sea.But if I can pinpoint even the faintest of silver linings on this gigantic black dot, it’s the lesson that I really do get by with a little help from my friends, and a lot of help from telecommunications technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84dd40a4b177c134f055219326f426176529b948/0_218_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52fd3db8413811d6b8fe3c7baec4f7b3","title":"bbc three could return as broadcast channel under proposals","story":"BBC’s annual plan to more than double channel’s budget over next two yearsBBC Three could make a triumphant return as a broadcast TV channel after enjoying a run of hits – from Fleabag to lockdown obsession Normal People – that have rated with the youth audience the corporation is desperate to win over.The corporation is actively exploring reviving the broadcast channel, four years after it was taken online-only, according to the BBC’s annual plan due to be published on Wednesday.Regardless of what is decided, the channel will have its programme budget more than double to £80m over the next two years. This bulking up will mean it is able to commission enough programming for a linear TV schedule, but will entail cuts elsewhere in the corporation.The annual plan, which sets out the BBC’s intentions for the next financial year, says the corporation has turned around the slide of youth audiences trickling away to other services such as Netflix.Two years ago the corporation said it faced a crisis over reaching younger audiences, revealing that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer.“BBC Three has become home to some of our biggest shows,” said a BBC source. “We need to back that success, so within an environment where we are making difficult cuts, this is one of a limited number of areas where we will seek to invest. Who wouldn’t want more Fleabags, Killing Eves, This Country or Normal People?”Earlier this month, Normal People, which the corporation says has now had more than 38m requests to view it on the iPlayer, helped deliver the best week ever for BBC Three as TV viewing soared under lockdown conditions.The annual plan will point to BBC research that shows there is still a big available audience on broadcast television. The huge success of digital channel ITV2’s in attracting millions of younger viewers to Love Island is a case in point that has not gone unnoticed at the BBC.One executive at the corporation said BBC Three “has been a real hit machine … but it’s also reaching the wider population as well.”The channel’s new budget will be almost twice that of BBC Four’s £44m, as rumours circulate that the arts and culture channel could face the threat of closure.BBC Four attracts a small, niche audience of mostly older viewers to its schedule of shows, although it was responsible for creating the hit comedy The Thick of It. The corporation has made it clear that its goal is to pursue younger audiences.Speculation intensified earlier this month when it was announced that Cassian Harrison, BBC Four’s long-serving controller, is to move to BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm, on a nine-month attachment.While the annual plan does not explicitly protect the future of BBC Four, sources say a closure is not on the cards.“This is not about playing off BBC Four against BBC Three,” said a BBC source. “Contrary to reports, the BBC has no plans to close it or diminish our arts portfolio.”The annual plan will also address the negative impact the pandemic is having on the corporation’s finances. The BBC has predicted its income will fall by £125m this year as people stop paying the licence fee during the coronavirus pandemic and as revenue from its commercial arm drops substantially.A source says the corporation will set out plans on how to “balance its books” in the autumn as a result, once the full financial impact of the coronavirus is clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

It can’t just be left to employers or politicians, we’ve got to step up too.”The TUC, which represents 5.5 million members, is also calling for an overhaul of the UK’s business model – which it argues is based on low-paid, insecure jobs and the exclusion of workers from decision-making. It has called for an increase in the minimum wage to £10 an hour, a public sector pay rise, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme – particularly for young people facing a bleak future.In the far-reaching document the TUC argues that systems for trade and finance damage the interests of poorer countries and drive unfair pay, and calls for changes to international rules and institutions, as well as a plan to tackle discrimination faced by black and minority ethnic people, women and disabled people.It praises the government’s “constructive” work with unions on the creation of the job retention scheme, adding that the ability of local authorities to take homeless people off the street, the emergence of mutual support groups and the adaptability of the workforce, as well as government interventions, “show the speed and scale of what can be done when it is necessary”. It adds that the same commitment and urgency must be applied to tackling the climate emergency.“We’ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy,” said O’Grady.Industry bailouts and any state investment in the next few months must come with an “Olympics-style plan” for jobs and a minimum requirement for the use of UK products and services to rebuild UK manufacturing, says the report. With unemployment levels set to increase dramatically, it argues jobless people should be given a “funded inidual learning account” to learn new skills, with the promise of a job at the end of training.“We’ve got to build back brick by brick, but it has to be fair, decent rewards, fair taxes – all of that has got to be back on the agenda,” said O’Grady. “I think the centre of gravity has shifted and people are remembering why equality matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f12eb78b762a35840885aaa1fbfd2d9b4abce3c/0_85_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=63fd89aa064dd198c9b7e4a399c33ad8","title":"covid 19 can we compare different countries podcast","story":"Nicola Davis asks mathematician Kit Yates how useful global comparisons are when it comes to the coronavirus outbreak, given the huge differences in demographics and public health responses.

The hope is that it would apply throughout the country, as many gym companies have facilities across national boundaries, although those involved accept devolution could present certain challenges.Grassroots football and rugby clubs could also be allowed to train together in separate groups of five that month, if the rate of infections continues to fall and public health officials rule it is safe to do so. However, those wanting to play contact sports – including rugby with full scrummaging, boxing and mixed martial arts – are likely to have to wait until September or October before a full return to action is deemed safe.One government source stressed while the new proposals were dependent on the wider picture across society, there had been a shift in thinking and that guidelines from representatives of the UK’s 7,000 gyms to potentially reopen were now being actively considered.Another source said gyms had worked “really hard to bring sensible solutions” to the table and that, as a result, they could open much earlier than October, as had originally been envisaged.A meeting between the government, health officials and representatives of the gym and leisure industry will take place in the coming days to sketch out a potential roadmap back.Huw Edwards, the chief executive of UK Active, which represents thousands of gyms and leisure centres, said he was cautiously optimistic the industry – which employs 400,000 people and is worth around £8bn a year – could be back on its feet by the summer. “We want to open in a way which is safe for staff and customers, allows people to come back and train, and then gets businesses up and running again,” he said.“The government has said to us nothing before the fourth of July. Our plan is to take government and Public Health England officials out to sites to reassure them that gyms can safely implement social distancing. We are going to be a completely open book.”Edwards said UK Active have spent five weeks drawing up plans for how gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools could reopen while observing government guidelines. The advice includes spacing exercise equipment two metres apart or marking every other machine as out of order and a maximum capacity for users at any one time depending on the size of the gym.“The guidance goes through everything: from deep-cleaning equipment and reworking gym floors and studios to maintain social distancing rules and the need to have signs to direct people so the flow feels more when you enter a supermarket,” he said. “Naturally, there will be reduced capacity too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2fb43104f440911ee25bb378546b1754610fe63/0_122_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902727116b47a20503bbed8f8e9a6098","title":"merger of equals johanna konta backs idea to combine atp and wta tours","story":"Johanna Konta has cautiously offered her support to the idea of the ATP and the WTA tours merging.While discussions about the viability of a merger were pushed into the spotlight by tweets from Roger Federer in April – since when both ATP and WTA chief executives, Andrea Gaudenzi and Steve Simon – have expressed support for it, Konta has underlined that it remains only an idea.A prominent member of the WTA player council – which has convened frequently since the tour suspension – Konta points out that “not so much” has been said since the initial discussion following Federer’s tweets. Should anything come to fruition, she stresses the need for equality.“For me, for my comprehension, I don’t understand how it wouldn’t be of equals because if we are then talking about that, would it be us literally saying we are worth less than our male counterparts? It would have to be a merger of equals because that’s what we are. I wouldn’t see how, right now in today’s age, it would be allowed to be called anything else.”It is not difficult to understand Konta’s caution. This time last year, her run to the semi‑finals at Roland Garros ended against Marketa Vondrousova after they were forced on to a half‑empty stadium away from the show courts following bad weather. She said afterwards that she was tired of women having to “justify their scheduling or their involvement in an event or their salary or their opportunities”. She understands the potential cost of the WTA losing its independence.As eloquent as Konta has always been on general issues, she can be less forthcoming about her own tennis. She often projects her mentality, cocooning herself in relentless positivity. It can be difficult to know how she really feels. One year later, it is refreshing to hear an honest reflection of her Parisian fortnight.“To make it to the semis for the first time since 2017 was something special. But then there was bit of heartbreak for me … it was a tough match to lose because I had opportunities, and my opponent played well. Definitely whoever was going to lose that match was going to hurt, and it definitely hurt. But I can look back and say I am a semi-finalist at the French Open and it’s something I can be proud of. And who knows, I may get another opportunity.”As for now, Konta’s ongoing knee injury is “getting there” but is something she will always have to manage. She is open to contesting the planned LTA national tournaments as the tour remains frozen, now suspended until at least 31 July with the US Open’s status to be declared in mid-June. She has started the Johanna Konta Podcast to pass the time. She misses strolling to her favourite cafe in Battersea Park.“I miss people being relaxed as well,” the 29-year-old player said. “When you’re outside you can feel people being anxious. I think there are quite a lot of angry people about, although there are a lot of very kind people who are being more friendly than normal and want to interact. But there is a lot of anxiety about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce082824558ca518e71a6c7bac8fee6159d7771/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cb12083c1ceb4c07fa2e5f180a3cd43","title":"david nicholls understudy radio play stephen fry drama after coronavirus","story":"As his novel The Understudy is turned into a radio play starring Stephen Fry, the writer talks about his own failed acting career – and what dramas will be like after the coronavirusLong before David Nicholls was a successful novelist and screenwriter, he was a failed actor. In his eight years in the game, he trod the boards in mostly minor roles and tried not to bump into the furniture. More often, though, he was off stage as an understudy. “I would watch actors my own age,” he says. “They had such grace and charisma. I knew in my heart of hearts, I was always going to be workaday, lacking that unnameable quality.”Being the natural writer he is, though, Nicholls turned that failure into success, via fiction. The Understudy, written in 2005, was a hugely popular romantic comedy that sent up the preening, thespy world of the stage, while still containing an unspoken love of its sawdust and drama. The novel follows an understudy in a West End production, a man of middling talent who remains the underdog.The story is now being revived as a radio play, by the Lawrence Batley theatre in Huddersfield, which will stream it online. Adapted by Henry Filloux-Bennett, it stars Stephen Fry and Russell Tovey, with proceeds going to help the theatre industry affected by lockdown. Nicholls is thrilled it’s back – and equally pleased that he has nothing to do with the production. “I don’t need to police it,” he says, although he does admit: “I’m really fond of it, but I found it to be that difficult second novel. It’s the one I most yearn to rewrite.”Nicholls, who is 53, has written five novels and adapted each for the screen, including One Day, which starred Anne Hathaway. He has also made acclaimed adaptations of other writers’ work, from Patrick Melrose, the TV series of Edward St Aubyn’s books starring Benedict Cumberbatch, to Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Far from the Madding Crowd. Nicholls attributes a good deal of his success as a writer to his failed stage career. “I learned a lot from watching the actors perform, listening to dialogue, observing the moments when the joke didn’t quite land. It was a kind of apprenticeship.”What he missed most when he left acting was the camaraderie of a theatre company. His most recent novel, Sweet Sorrow, revolves around just this subject. “It recounts the youthful excitement I felt at being in a company,” he says. Sweet Sorrow tells the story of a troubled 16-year-old called Charlie who joins the Full Fathom Five Theatre Co-operative – but only to be closer to Fran Fisher, a self-proclaimed “Shakespeare nut” on whom he has a desperate crush. “He looks at theatre from the outside and sees it as a bit posh and silly,” says Nicholls. Yet Charlie learns from the experience of putting on Romeo and Juliet and comes to feel a sense of belonging, of family even.Nicholls has tried writing plays for the stage, but it hasn’t clicked. “It’s a particular skill and I stumbled in the crafting of it – even getting people on and off a stage.” He studied drama and English at Bristol University at a time when it was a breeding ground for mould-breaking playwrights: Mark Ravenhill and Sarah Kane took the course, though not at the same time as Nicholls. “The emphasis then seemed to be on radically devised work,” recalls the writer who was, by contrast, steeped in the realism of TV sitcoms, soaps and films, having grown up in a household of modest means in Eastleigh, a small Hampshire town that did not have its own theatre.When he gave up acting, he stopped going to the theatre regularly. “Now that I can’t go,” he says, “I’m asking myself, ‘Why wasn’t I there every night?’” However, the consequences of lockdown on his work have not been disastrous, even if the BBC’s forthcoming adaptation of Us, starring Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves, has been halted. It is due to be screened later this year as the production team finds ways to add finishing touches remotely.Beyond this, the pandemic has left him a little stuck imaginatively. After Sweet Sorrow, set in the 90s, he was planning to write a novella situated in the present day. “I wanted to write about now, but ‘now’ changes day by day.” And he doesn’t find the nerve-jangling news feed of Covid-19 stories conducive to writing fiction: Nicholls lives in London with his partner, Hannah, an art historian, and their two children, aged 12 and 14, so parenting is taking up time and headspace instead.He was shaken by the recent news that Nuffield Southampton theatres had gone into administration. “The first play I ever saw was there. It was the only theatre I had access to, so its loss strikes a chord. For all my own failures in that world, it was an important, inspiring place, the model of a great community rep, an introduction to amazing plays. I hope it rises again.”As for physical distancing, he says: “There is a glorious recklessness in physical contact, not just in theatre but in the medium of television. I crave to see people touching, kissing, fighting on screen. I think the lockdown has reminded us how much we crave physical interaction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac06cd0a7f39f2e8d9ed1a5965bd0c7dd0d6f275/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc1a5827b99ca7e62d721b3c01a40f9","title":"emojis coronavirus covid 19 unicode consortium","story":"The pandemic has forced the Unicode Consortium to delay new emojis in 2021 – but remixes of existing ones could be on their wayCovid-19 has taken so much from us, but now it’s come for our emojis too.As a result of the global pandemic, the Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for digital typography, has been forced to delay the next set of updates, from March 2021, when they were due to be finalized, until September 2021.That will have a knock-on effect for OS at Apple and Google, who will struggle to implement the new designs on their normal timescale. All of which means that 2021 might see no brand new emojis.That’s more of a hit than it might seem. On an emotional level, the rollout of new emojis is important people who want to represent themselves in the lingua franca of the 21st century. And on a technical level, the pictograms are an important carrot dangled by the smartphone manufacturers to get people to go through the effort of installing software updates, which are crucial to protect users from security vulnerabilities and hacking attacks.But all is not lost. For one thing, the 2020 emoji updates are still on their way: those designs – including representations of bubble tea, people hugging and the transgender flag – are making their way through the development process now, and should hit most phones this autumn.And there’s a technical quirk that provides even more hope, says Jeremy Burge, the chief emoji officer of Emojipedia. The lack of a new version of the unicode standard means there won’t be any new emojis, but there could still be new emoji sequences.The distinction is that some are technically made up of a combination of others. Take 👷, for instance – “construction worker”. That’s a basic emoji, the type that requires a new version of the Unicode Standard to create. But 👷🏻‍♂️, a light-skinned male construction worker, is a sequence: even though it looks like one emoji, it’s actually represented by three in a row.Most ersity in human representations is carried out with this technical quirk, but other emojis use the same trick. Add white flag, 🏳 and rainbow, 🌈 , and you get the rainbow flag: 🏳️‍🌈. Add a dog 🐕 and a worker’s vest 🦺 and you get a service dog: 🐕‍🦺.“People might not be interested in the technical difference between an emoji like 👮 (police officer) and an emoji sequence like 🧑‍🚒 (firefighter), as they both look like normal emojis on an emoji keyboard,” Burge says. “But Unicode can still approve new sequences to roll out next year, and have said they might do this.”That means we definitely won’t be seeing the all-new candidates – proposals including Vulture, Bubbles, Hand With Index Finger and Thumb Crossed – before 2022, but could see a limited release with remixes of existing emojis.It’s easy to roll your eyes at the endless march of new emojis, but the system is meaningful for many – and has been democratised in recent years. The turning point was the introduction of the dumpling emoji in 2017, following a campaign by journalist Jennifer 8 Lee and her friend Yiying Lu.“The fact there was no dumpling emoji told me whatever system was in place had failed,” Lee told Forbes magazine, citing the universality of the food, which has its own native equivalents in countries from Italy to Japan. She began a campaign to join the Unicode Consortium, and crowdfunded the entry fee, becoming the first member of the group to have joined with the express intention of creating emoji for the people.In the meantime, we can at least be glad that the slowdown means we won’t have to deal with emoji added specifically in relation to what’s happening in the world right now. We’re already seeing unprecedented use of the microbe emoji 🦠 and the face with medical mask 😷, according to an analysis Burge carried out in the first week of the crisis that should do for the time being. It’s not like you can use emoji on a Zoom call anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a038145cf7f5489cfc4fecdc02891f57c147/0_24_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=91ab890c5daf618b1c9453b2953fb320","title":"surface go 2 review microsofts smaller cheaper windows 10 tablet","story":"New model squeezes bigger screen in same body, for an excellent, affordable ultraportable PC The Surface Go 2 is Microsoft’s second iteration of its low-cost, smaller tablet computer and continues to prove that cheap Windows PCs don’t have to be terrible.The Surface Go 2 starts at £399, but for that you don’t get the £100 Type Cover keyboard, which is a must-have. That places the Surface Go 2 in the low-end PC bracket and makes it Microsoft’s cheapest current PC, undercutting the Surface Pro 7 by £300.Tested here is the £529 Intel Pentium Gold 4425Y version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of faster SSD storage with the £125 Alcantara Type Cover.Not a lot has changed since the original. The Surface Go 2 has a slightly larger 10.5in screen, which helps boost the real estate you have on there. Other than an extra 22g in weight, the magnesium body of the machine is identical to the original Surface Go, at 8.3mm thick, 245mm long and 175mm tall. It weighs in at 544g. By any metric the Surface Go 2 is a tiny portable PC, that’s easy to carry or fit in a bag, much like Apple’s similarly priced and sized iPad Air.The 10.5in LCD touchscreen is great. Crisp, bright, good looking and responsive. The kickstand on the back continues to be fantastic, while the build quality is top notch.The new Pentium Gold 4425Y performs more or less the same as the Pentium Gold 4415Y in the original Surface Go, according to both benchmarks and real-world experience. That means it’s not exactly fast, but is capable of more than you might imagine.Photo editing in Affinity Photo was a just little slow for complex tasks, word processing and general office duties were no bother, while the new Chromium-based Edge browser handled 10+ tabs with ease. Only a little slowdown was noticeable when you tried to do too much at once, such as updating apps, browsing and using a word processor all at the same time.The tablet even managed to power a 4K display at 60Hz via USB-C without issue.When just used for video playback the Surface Go 2 lasted closer to eight hours, streaming video via Netflix.Like the recent Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3, the Surface Go 2 continues Microsoft’s trend of more repairable devices, and was awarded a score of three out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which is two-points better than the previous generation Surface Go.Some of the components are modular but not user-replaceable, except for the detachable keyboard, and repairs must be performed by authorised service providers. The out-of-warranty service fee for the Surface Go 2 from Microsoft is £236.40.The Surface Go 2 ships with Windows 10 Home in S mode, which restricts the installation of apps to those from the Microsoft Store for greater security. Turning off S mode is a one-time operation that cannot be reversed, but it takes just a couple of clicks.S mode is great if you live within Microsoft’s ecosystem, or if everything you need is in the Microsoft Store, but it blocks the installation of programs such as Chrome, WhatsApp desktop and Signal, which aren’t available.As a productivity machine the Surface Go 2 is solid. It managed everything I do as a journalist without much fuss, including simple word processing, spreadsheet-wrangling, browsing, note taking, image editing and video conferencing. It would struggle with serious video editing.The slightly larger 10.5in screen helps with split-screen multi-tasking, such as Evernote on the right and PDFs on the left of the screen, but still requires lots of sideways scrolling in documents and websites.As a home-entertainment machine, things are little trickier. The great screen and good speakers make the Surface Go 2 good for video, but there’s still an large app gap compared to Apple’s iPad.The Microsoft Store sells movies and TV shows, and has a great Netflix app, including offline downloads, Virgin TV Go, Demand 5 and iTunes. But others such as Disney+, Amazon Video, Google Play Movies, ITV Hub, BBC iPlayer, All4 and Sky Go have to be viewed in a browser.BBC iPlayer and Sky Go have fairly clunky programs that allow offline downloads, but they are not in the Microsoft Store, so not accessible in S mode.Reading apps are equally few and far between, with no Kindle, Comixology or Marvel Unlimited apps at all.One big advantage Windows 10 has over Apple’s iPad OS is support for multiple users. This includes limited and monitored kids’ accounts, which work great with Windows Hello face recognition.The Surface Go 2’s Type Cover keyboard is the same as the previous version and is cross-compatible, costing £100 or £125, depending on the material.The Type Cover is one of the best keyboards available on any laptop or tablet, matching those available for the larger Surface Pro 7, but with a slightly smaller layout, which took about five minutes to get used to.The keys feel great and the trackpad is smooth, responsive and accurate. It will beat any keyboard and trackpad fitted to any Windows laptop or Chromebook under £500, and should have been included in the price of the tablet.The Surface Go 2 once again proves that budget Windows PCs can be good.It won’t win any awards for speed, but it will handle most things without locking up or driving you nuts. The magnesium body and 10.5in screen are far better than what you’ll get elsewhere for under £400, while the kickstand and range of accessories are great.As with the original, the app gap means the Surface Go 2 is a better productivity machine than media-consumption tablet. But it’s also good for sharing with the family, and is up to being your only computer or used as an ultraportable second computer.The 64GB version will be slower as it uses eMMC storage instead of the faster SSD technology. And while £399 is an extremely attractive starting price, it doesn’t include the essential £100 Type Cover keyboard.Other than wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5 support, only the slightly larger 10.5in screen really separates the lower-end Pentium Gold Surface Go 2 models from the equally excellent original, so look out for cut-price deals.At the real price of £499 or more, you can certainly get a more powerful Windows laptop, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better experience. The gutsy little Surface Go 2 is simply great.Cons: relatively short battery life, no USB-A ports, £100 keyboard essential but not included, relatively slow performance This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.”Le Bonniec, 25, worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Cork offices, transcribing user requests in English and French, until he quit in the summer of 2019 due to ethical concerns with the work. “They do operate on a moral and legal grey area,” he told the  at the time, “and they have been doing this for years on a massive scale. They should be called out in every possible way.”Following the revelations of Le Bonniec and his colleagues, Apple promised sweeping changes to its “grading” program, which involved thousands of contractors listening to recordings made, both accidentally and deliberately, using Siri. The company apologised, brought the work in-house, and promised that it would only grade recordings from users who had explicitly opted-in to the practice.“We realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals,” the company said in a statement in August. It eventually released a software update in late October that allowed users to opt-in or out of their voice recordings being used to “improve Siri dictation”, and to choose to delete the recordings that Apple had stored. The company also emphasised that, unlike its competition, Siri recordings are never linked to a specific Apple account.But, Le Bonniec argues, the company never really faced the consequences for its years-long programme in the first place.“I listened to hundreds of recordings every day, from various Apple devices (eg. iPhones, Apple Watches, or iPads). These recordings were often taken outside of any activation of Siri, eg in the context of an actual intention from the user to activate it for a request. These processings were made without users being aware of it, and were gathered into datasets to correct the transcription of the recording made by the device,” he said.“The recordings were not limited to the users of Apple devices, but also involved relatives, children, friends, colleagues, and whoever could be recorded by the device. The system recorded everything: names, addresses, messages, searches, arguments, background noises, films, and conversations. I heard people talking about their cancer, referring to dead relatives, religion, sexuality, pornography, politics, school, relationships, or drugs with no intention to activate Siri whatsoever.“These practices are clearly at odds with the company’s ‘privacy-driven’ policies and should be urgently investigated by data protection authorities and Privacy watchdogs. With the current statement, I want to bring this issue to your attention, and also offer my cooperation to provide any element substantiating these facts. Although this case has already gone public, Apple has not been subject to any kind of investigation to the best of my knowledge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

Tourism feeds me and my daughter. It lets me give jobs to 22 people. It goes into the whole community,” says Naima Montejo, owner of Surf Meds Caribe, the only female-run surf school on Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast.“We’ve been planting, growing food, trying to come back to our roots,” she says. “There’s not much money, so we’ve been trading. Some trees or seeds, some yucca or plantain. We switch. People are getting together, being creative. What we can do is help each other.”Montejo lives in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, a coastal town known for surf, three-toed sloths and an eight-mile stretch of jungle-edged sandy beach (now behind police tape). With a tropical climate and jubilant mix of Tico, African-Caribbean, indigenous and nearly 70 more nationalities, it touts pared-back beach life and an offbeat Caribbean vibe: languid yet lively. Much of the region is nature reserve. Most of its residents remember a time when the only route to town was the beach and, like a lot of the country, tourism is its lifeforce.Puerto Viejo has been “shut” since 16 March, when Costa Rica declared a state of emergency, and then closed borders, businesses and beaches in quick succession. The country’s mantra, main greeting and answer to all questions, pura vida (literally, pure life), was traded for quédate en casa (stay at home).With the exception of a local ley seca (dry law) banning booze sales – quietly dropped in April – the general view is that the swift, strict response worked. With its hotels and rental homes shuttered and driving access restricted, remote Puerto Viejo has no registered cases (or hospitals).But running a surf school when the beach is behind police tape, you have no students and strict social distancing is in place “has been hard on all of us,” says Montejo, whose team are all ardent pro-level surfers “usually more in the water than out”.With lessons off, Montejo has got back into landscaping and garden design, and her work as a jeweller. Making ends meet “takes a lot more energy,” she says, “but the only thing that really worries me is the guys: a lot of them live from teaching.”The government is paying out a monthly unemployment “bonus”, but only to those “officially” employed before the crisis. Which leaves out the casual workers, from fishermen to bike rental people, who usually cater to the 400,000 international visitors Costa Rica’s Caribbean area sees every year. Many of this number, plus thousands more Costa Ricans, come especially for Semana Santa, Easter week. Last year, hostel Selina, in Puerto Viejo, sold 1,045 beds between 14 and 20 April.“I’d never seen anything like it,” says Matías Llaituqueo, who runs Spanish language classes , as well as managing a local hotel and several Airbnb properties. He moved to Puerto Viejo from Argentina 13 years ago. “Semana Santa is incredible here: the people, the traffic, it’s so busy. But this year, nothing. No people on the street: like a ghost town.”The tourist exodus left established expats and a smattering of travellers, including several escapees from Panama’s locked-down Tribal Gathering festival. Some are pleased to wait out the pandemic jungle-side others are concerned about the start of dengue season and the flesh-eating papalomoyo parasite (fun to say, terrible to have).Of the unafflicted expats, many are following the worldwide upskilling trend. Llaituqueo’s Spanish classes have, if anything, increased: “People want to use their time well,” he says. “They can’t move, they can’t travel, they can’t go to the beach – so they decide to learn.”Rohrmoser and her mother – both originally from the capital, San José – opened the hotel a year and a half ago. They’re now facing relative inaction until the end of the year. “It had just started happening,” Rohrmoser says. “It’s heartbreaking, to give opportunities to so many people and now try to maintain things, keep jobs and keep a sense of perspective.”This week, Costa Rica’s boutique hotels, restaurants and national parks have reopened at limited capacity, while the beach is accessible from 5am-8am. But the impact has already been felt. Shevonne Newton set up Puerto Viejo Esenciales to supplement official food banks with necessities such as cooking gas and pet food, but found the need for food was far more urgent.“This has just made it more extreme,” she says. “Locals were already struggling. Now they definitely don’t have their gardening or their cooking positions. Without tourism the businesses just go under.”The impact may go beyond people and harm the environment, too. “You can’t ask people to prioritise conservation when they’re struggling to eat,” says Becky Cliffe, who runs the Sloth Conservation Foundation in Puerto Viejo and holds a PhD in sloth behaviour. Fewer visitors means fewer cars, and fewer tourists harassing the town’s sloth residents, she says. But on the other hand, the crisis can “mean the exploitation of nature: hunting, cutting down trees for wood – and lost income for the rescue centres”.Nature guide Abel Bustamante agrees: “Many conservation programmes are closed because there are no volunteers. We go to the beach first thing to stop people taking turtle eggs and selling or eating them. Sadly, they mean money or food, and you don’t think about sustainability when you need to eat.”The community is using the time to preserve its cherished pura vida, with landlocked surfers reforesting the beachside areas affected by erosion: “We used to come out of the water, grab some mango, eat right there and go back to surf – but these trees have disappeared,” says Montejo. “Tourism picked up really quickly here. Hopefully, after this we can manage it more respectfully.” There’s a lot to work out for Montejo’s team: from how to run a biosecure hotel to how to teach surfing in a world of social distancing. But for now, she’ll join the town’s surfers, swimmers, dog-walkers and fishermen for the sanctioned 5am-8am migration into Puerto Viejo’s indomitable ocean swell. Pura vida."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e5807b698b2eb028cf5504bf8d70394faa9c9d/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b18aa562885b0c27a778ba050a7178","title":"a very british hotel chain inside best western review too mean by half","story":"While there are moments of genuine humour, the sneering tone of this fly-on-the-wall documentary doesn’t sit well – particularly when the hospitality industry is suffering Many big questions are being asked about how the coronavirus pandemic will reshape our lives, society and culture. Will it make the NHS respected, untouchable and better funded? Will it force a reckoning between the haves and the have-nots? Will the resurgence of nature, caused by the retreat of humans, prompt us to re-evaluate our responses to the climate breakdown?But such questions are for the serious pages of the newspaper. Here, we can only ask: post-corona, whither television? Obviously, the practical ramifications are already being felt. Filming has been shut down or postponed everywhere, holes in the schedules are getting larger and deeper and those in the business of acting, directing or producing are trying to find ways to build dramas and documentaries via Zoom. But perhaps it is more interesting to think about intangibles – how tastes might change under this kind of pressure, what appetites might disappear, what new ones might be born in the aftermath.If I were a betting woman, I would place a modest wager on the likes of A Very British Hotel Chain: Inside Best Western (Channel 4) falling out of fashion. It is subtly different from the handful of predecessors that spring to mind. A Very British Hotel went behind the scenes of the opulent Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park in London, while Inside Claridge’s took its subjects at their own estimation and marvelled at the efforts that went into managing the very, very rich and famous. Elsewhere, the 1997 BBC fly-on-the-wall series Hotel made the Adelphi in Liverpool famous (and hopefully richer), by showing us its microcosm in full, warm detail, with Andrew Sachs narrating with a light but straight touch.A Very British Hotel Chain, by comparison, feels mean-spirited. Perhaps under normal circumstances it would have gone unnoticed, but there is a sneering undertone, a muted bagpipe drone, throughout. It is hard to provide solid evidence of a tone, but it has something to do with Jerusalem being played over the top of our first sighting of a Best Western hotel (in Fowey, Cornwall) and the repeated mentions of the brand’s hotels being distributed largely along motorway routes (“You’re never more than three junctions away from a Best Western”) as if that is funny or risible. It has something to do with the choice of Diane Morgan (of Philomena Cunk fame) for the almost sardonic voiceover that invites us to observe the people from a distance (“This is Terii, with two Is”) rather than warm to them. And it has something to do with the lingering shots of a bubblegum-pink money box (for tips) in the shape of a bus on a reception counter while deputy general manager Jane explains that, because the US-based company’s hotels are inidually owned and run, “they have soul”.There is nothing wrong with showcasing genuine moments of bathos, of course. The opening episode alone yielded plenty of those – enough to hold your interest without exposing simple moments of dullness and playing for laughs. Hotel inspector Alasdair’s flourishing of his tape measure with the explanation: “I pinched this out of my mother’s sewing box. She’s been dead for over 20 years,” does not need anything more. He is also a source of genuine, deliberate humour (for example, his comment when nobody comes running when he tests the emergency cord in a bathroom – “I can just lie here and bleed, I don’t mind”), which throws the other bad faith “laughs” sharply into relief.There is also – although this is not the makers’ fault – the question of how many of the people we are watching are now furloughed (at best) or wondering if and when they will have a hospitality industry to go back to.Perhaps it is impossible to make a documentary about anyone or any kind of setting that reminds us of The Office, which held unglamorous lives up to such pitiless scrutiny, or to aim (as A Very British Hotel Chain might have been trying) for an Alan BennettVictoria Wood warmth when dealing with nonfictional characters.Or perhaps I am just being hugely oversensitive and ridiculous. But in a world in which the margins of fairness and kindness are being so tightly squeezed, A Very British Hotel Chain felt like a dismal hour in a time already full of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

He’s a true national treasure.”Moore raised a record-breaking sum by completing 100 laps of his garden – and provided welcome relief from relentlessly grim headlines at the peak of the virus’s outbreak.He turned 100 at the end of April, shortly after becoming the oldest artist to claim a UK No 1 single after collaborating with Michael Ball and the choir NHS Voices of Care on a cover of You’ll Never Walk Alone.Ball was among those to congratulate Moore on his knighthood, tweeting that he “couldn’t be more thrilled and proud” and calling it “a fitting honour for a true British hero”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: “On behalf of the Labour party, I congratulate Captain Tom Moore on his knighthood. In these difficult times for our country, Tom brought inspiration to millions and helped all of us to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of our NHS.“In his actions, Tom embodied the national solidarity which has grown throughout this crisis, and showed us that everyone can play their part in helping build a better future.”Starmer has accused the government of failing to do enough to protect veterans, many of whom are now in the care homes that have become coronavirus hotspots.A government spokesperson said they would also be saying more about how “frontline heroes” could be recognised in the days ahead.The spokesperson continued: “We know there is huge appetite to say thank you to all those supporting the nation during this emergency and doing incredible things day in, day out, up and down the country. “We will ensure these unsung heroes are recognised in the right way, at the right time.”Ministers have declined to say at the regular press briefings whether they believe nurses and other NHS and care staff who have put their lives at risk should receive a pay increase.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said last week “there has been a significant pay rise for nurses, and I think one of the things the crisis has shown is just how much the nation values our staff across the health and care system, including nurses.“When it comes to how we reward their efforts in this crisis, what I can tell you is, as the health secretary, I will be making sure that we fight to have that fair reward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be48a7ff54b2043daec17c5baca842fbfee6690a/0_51_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92b4fcf76d54b03d38407fca2d7fb84c","title":"uk to test hydroxychloroqine as coronavirus treatment","story":"Drug taken by Trump being acquired in case it proves effective against coronavirusHydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug being taken by Donald Trump as an unproven protection against coronavirus, is being bought in bulk by the UK in case it does turn out to be an effective Covid-19 treatment.Ministers are seeking 16m tablets in packets of up to 100 as part of a £35m contract put out to tender on Friday.The drug is being tested by government scientists, health officials said. They are securing additional supplies so it can be distributed among the population if required.The contract, which was uploaded to a government website on 15 May, is an “open opportunity” for pharmaceutical suppliers to supply more than 33m tablets of various drugs between June and next January.There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus, and regulators have warned the drug could cause heart problems.However, there were concerns that Trump’s endorsement would prompt a worldwide shortage of the drug, which can be used to treat lupus and other conditions.Trump told a White House press conference: “I’m taking it for about a week and a half now and I’m still here, I’m still here.”According to the contract, the government is asking for the drug to be supplied in either 220mg or 250mg form.“In accordance with the terms of this invitation to offer the authority may accept offers for alternative strengths of tablets,” the contract says.Studies are under way across the UK, Europe and the US to examine if the drug and a similar one, chloroquine, are effective against the coronavirus.UK scientists have been examining whether the drug can be used to treat the disease, rather than prevent it. The UK does not at present recommend its use.A source with knowledge of the contract said the drug was being bought in bulk so that if it proves to be effective as a treatment there is a ready supply. “All of the drugs being purchased can be used to treat other conditions too so they don’t really go to waste if they aren’t proved effective for Covid,” the source said.Other drugs being bought as part of the £35m contract include 1.4m tablets of lopinavir-ritonavir, which is used to treat people who are HIV positive dexamethasone as an oral solution and 20m azithromycin capsules in packs of up to six.A Whitehall source said the purchase of hydroxychloroquine was related to current clinical trials to evaluate it as a treatment for people with Covid-19, adding that it should only be taken on prescription or as part of a controlled clinical trial.The World Health Organization has said it is concerned by reports of iniduals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm.Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.A widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days has led to it being touted in some quarters as a potential cure for Covid-19. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigour to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn’t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea. US president Donald Trump has claimed he takes hydroxychloroquine despite FDA warnings.Here is a guide to the scientific studies into hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus carried out so far.Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It’s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not. The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.Trump was hosting a meeting about the struggling restaurant industry on Monday when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug.“You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,” he told reporters. “I happen to be taking it.” The drug was also endorsed by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. disclosed last week that the UK government had entered into 16 contracts for chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine phosphate, and placed orders for lopinavir-ritonavir.Contracts with British-based firms were entered into without going to tender on the grounds of “extreme urgency”, according to an online record of the deals.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the way on research in the race to find and fast-track potential treatments, and clinical trials are under way to assess whether existing medicines are safe and effective for treating Covid-19.“This includes hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, dexamethasone and azithromycin, and we have procured these medicines to support clinical trials.“But until we have clear, definitive evidence these treatments are safe and effective, we do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine outside of a clinical trial.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0ff74f72845ef3b19603548036504bd51b37e4/0_256_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd0ad566d56ac2f22fcebbeef4e3390","title":"up to 1500 english primary schools to defy 1 june reopening plan","story":"Coronavirus rebellion by councils forces government to say it will not sanction themUp to 1,500 primary schools in England are expected to remain closed on 1 June after a rebellion by at least 18 councils forced the government to say it had no plans to sanction them.As the backlash escalated over the government’s policy of lifting the coronavirus lockdown on schools in a fortnight, a number of new local authorities said on Tuesday they would not force primary schools in their area to follow the plan. Councils joining those already in opposition included Birmingham, Calderdale council in Yorkshire, and Conservative-controlled Solihull. In total they represent more than 1,500 maintained primaries.With more councils likely to join them on Wednesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, met union leaders to address concerns that the plan could put staff at risk and contribute to the spread of coronavirus. Downing Street said its aim was to work “in a consultative way” rather than impose penalties on schools or councils that rejected the reopening date.Reports earlier this week suggested councils that refused to comply could be subject to legal action or even financial penalties, but the prime minister’s spokesman told reporters: “We are continuing to work closely with teachers, schools and the unions, as we have done for the past eight weeks, and remain keen to hear any concerns they may have.“We are preparing for the possible opening of schools for more children from 1 June at the earliest, but that will only happen if it is safe to do so. But we do also have to bear in mind the harm which can be done to children by missing out on important education.”Asked if there could be any sanctions for those who disagreed, he said: “You can see what the focus of our attention is at the moment, which is trying to work with them in a consultative way in order to be able to open schools to more pupils in a way that is safe.”The government has said it wants children in nursery, reception, years 1 and 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so primary children are in school for a month before the summer holidays, as long as the government’s five tests for easing lockdown have been met.However, another obstacle to the 1 June target emerged on Tuesday when the deputy chief scientific adviser Dame Angela McLean said all changes to lockdown would require an effective system for tracing and isolating new cases to be in place, effectively adding a sixth test. McLean said changes should be based on “observed levels of infection … and not of a fixed date”. Apart from the councils that have said they will not be opening primary schools according to the government timetable, others, including Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle, said they would leave it to inidual schools to decide based on risk assessments.The Labour leader of Calderdale council, Tim Swift, said the “clear professional advice” they have is that not all of the government’s five tests for opening schools are being met. He cited concerns over the local rate of infection and limited access to testing.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:“There is not enough evidence that the levels of infection in the community are low and falling and we are not confident that there is guaranteed access to testing so that, in the event of a case, both the inidual concerned and all their contacts can be identified and rapidly tested for the virus,” he said.“Our priority as a council and as a Labour group throughout this crisis has been to put the safety and wellbeing of our community first. For these reasons, whilst we want our schools to plan for opening up to more children when it is safe to do so, we are strongly advising schools that they should not be doing this as soon as 1 June.”Labour-held Leeds city council said the government reopening date was impossible. “Due to a variety of factors, it would be impossible for all schools to operate to the government’s timetable of opening reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June,” said Cllr Jonathan Pryor, an executive member for learning and skills. “While some schools will begin to gradually expand their intake from this date, Leeds will not expect all our schools to open to all those pupils from day one.”Birmingham city council wrote to parents saying schools would only open to more pupils when it was safe. “We all know how valuable regular attendance at school is, particularly for the most vulnerable children, and we are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on 1 June, while parents and s must also feel reassured.”Ian Courts, the leader of Solihull council, said the priority was to ensure the safety of every child and staff member. “The reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend. So places may only be available from the week beginning 8 June.”In Bradford, Cllr Imran Khan, portfolio holder for education, employment and skills, said: “Bradford council has no intention of directing schools to open on 1 June or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open.”Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, Barking and Dagenham, and Redbridge – both in London – have also expressed reservations about the 1 June date.On Tuesday, a recording emerged of the National Education Union chief, Dr Mary Bousted, telling members that while its “negotiating position” was that it would not engage with the 1 June plan, that could change if public support for its stance waned.Secondary school pupils preparing for exams are expected to get some “face time” with teachers where possible. Schools have been closed since 20 March, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53effc07cc36de3c7c5724ffb801ef24","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.The US President told reporters at a cabinet meeting that the high number of cases in the US – far higher than any other country – is a “badge of honour”, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: “You know when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else.” He said he looks at the number “in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.”UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide.Trump claimed a recent United States study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a “Trump enemy statement”. “If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,” Trump said. “They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.” There have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to Covid-19 so far.New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers to consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent worklife balance issues. In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals.South Korean high schools opened on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic began, with mask-wearing seniors returning to class in the vanguard of a phased plan to reopen all schools under strict protocols to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online.China’s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country’s economic agenda and consolidate Xi’s power, but this year’s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi’s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world’s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government.Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. None of the WHO’s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The resolution backs the WHO’s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78904f71255fd1497431b0ccab09f3efc969287/0_23_4185_2511/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0a6b1bcffcb86397359c68a3fb627e","title":"jacinda ardern flags four day working week as way to rebuild new zealand after covid 19","story":"Prime minister says flexible working options can boost productivity and domestic tourism and improve worklife balanceNew Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has suggested employers consider a four-day working week and other flexible working options as a way to boost tourism and help employees address persistent worklife balance issues.In a Facebook live video Ardern said people had suggested everything from the shorter work week to more public holidays as a means to stimulate the economy and encourage domestic tourism, while the borders remain closed to foreign nationals.The prime minister’s informal comments have excited New Zealanders, many of whom are questioning whether seismic, systemic change will result from the pandemic – or whether life will return to normal with its associated problems.Speaking from Rotorua, one of the country’s tourist hubs, Ardern said many New Zealanders said they would travel more domestically if they had more flexibility in their working lives. The country’s tourism market has taken a massive downturn after the pandemic, with all borders remaining closed to foreign nationals and many New Zealanders taking pay-cuts or tightening their belt in case of lay-offs.“I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day workweek. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I’ve said there’s just so much we’ve learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,” Ardern said.“I’d really encourage people to think about that if you’re an employer and in a position to do so. To think about if that’s something that would work for your workplace because it certainly would help tourism all around the country.”Andrew Barnes is the founder of Perpetual , a business of more than 200 people that transitioned to a four-day workweek in 2018.Barnes found the shift made his employees happier and more productive and said the regime also had benefits for mental and physical health, the environment, family and social lives, and climate change.“New Zealand could definitely go to a four-day week in the aftermath of Covid, and in fact it would be a strategy to rebuild the economy and particularly the hard-hit tourism market as it pivots to a domestic focus,” Barnes said.“We need to retain all the productivity benefits working from home has brought, including cleaner air and a lack of gridlock lost productivity from commuting while helping businesses stay afloat. We have to be bold with our model. This is an opportunity for a massive reset.”Barnes said New Zealand could model its new way of work on the German system of kurzarbeit, meaning “short work”, allowing more people to stay in jobs and using the extra day to upskill or retrain.“Finally, we have to factor in the need to address widespread mental health problems,” Barnes said.Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have been made redundant during the lockdown period, with building company Fletchers announcing 1000 lay-offs today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ac8b2ddfffd517c7cf548a081d971e8850a6d4/0_125_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36e33878bfac8efb38282fa055f357f5","title":"no one had any idea contact tracers lack knowledge about covid 19 job","story":"Employees told to consult YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved personThey were hailed as stepping up to serve their country, with all the “rigorous” and “detailed” instruction needed for such an important role – but a programme to train thousands of contact-tracers to help control the spread of coronavirus has been described as shambolic and inadequate by recruits.People hired to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 and advise them to self-isolate have reported spending days just trying to log into the online system, and virtual training sessions that left participants unclear about their roles.New contact tracers have been told to rely on a two-page script and a list of frequently asked questions, both seen by the . When one taking part in a training session, run by contact centre company Sitel, asked for guidance on how to speak with somebody whose loved one had died of coronavirus, they were reportedly told to look at YouTube videos on the topic.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England, surpassing the initial target of 18,000. “They have rigorous training with detailed procedure designed by our experts at Public Health England,” he said. “They have stepped up to serve their country in their hour of need.”Hancock claimed the government now had “the elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service: the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology”.But one man, who asked to remain anonymous, told the  he had spent three days getting paid, but receiving very little information or training.He said he had applied for a job as a “Work at Home – Customer Service Adviser” for £10 an hour, which was advertised on the job website Indeed. He got an email checking he had the right software, and then received a call to tell him what the job entailed and ask when he could start.The people in the training were told they would be acting as agents in the contact-tracing team, working on behalf of PHE. “You will be acting as the first point of contact with the contacts of confirmed positive cases of Covid-19,” they were told in a slide presentation seen by the .They were told they would be calling up confirmed contacts of positive coronavirus cases, recording their data and escalating “more challenging cases” – including people who refused to cooperate – to more senior call handlers.“After the full day of training, people were still asking the most basic things. Someone also asked what they should do if they spoke to someone whose relative had died of the virus and he said we should look on YouTube where there are lots of videos about empathy and sympathy when talking to someone,” said the man.“Then I looked at the rota and it said I was starting the next morning at 9am,” he said. He logged in first thing and received a message saying “sit tight and wait for us to instruct you”. He did nothing all day, but got an email assuring him he would still get paid and was told that he would be doing more training soon.One woman told the  she had been recruited to be a contact tracer and had spent three days trying and failing to log into the Sitel system. “Matt Hancock was saying last night that it was all ready to go,” she said. “It’s not.”Responding to the complaints about contact-tracing training, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care – also speaking on behalf of Sitel – said that recruits were being trained ahead of the rollout, so were not yet expected to make calls.They said that all applicants were interviewed through a combination of online assessments and telephone screening and had to provide Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and Right to Work information. They added that a suggestion to use YouTube for advice on how to deal with a bereaved person would be investigated and was not in line with their training.“Staff are trained on data security, customer service, safeguarding vulnerable children and adults, operating procedures, and when to escalate issues among other matters,” they said. “Only applicants that have passed the training modules and technical tests are allowed to move onto the next stage and start work.”The testimony from contact tracers is the latest sign of problems with the government’s attempt to establish an efficient track, trace and isolate system, to allow the country to return to something close to normal life.On Sunday, ministers were accused by Labour of “misstep after misstep” after contact tracing applicants were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app.Emails sent by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said: “Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app.”DHSC said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, though a government spokesperson confirmed the next day that the rollout of the app would not take place by the middle of May, as initially promised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bb71cef77bae4ab11b12512f8cc61fb7fb18cc/438_0_5106_3066/master/5106.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5a6d87c6763b9e6a7adc0cbf388c18bb","title":"super cyclone amphan evacuations in india and bangladesh slowed by virus","story":"Thousands of migrant workers left jobless by Covid-19 pandemic are still on the roads, and evacuations have been hampered by distancing rulesThe Bay of Bengal’s fiercest storm this century – super cyclone Amphan – was bearing down on millions of people in eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge.Authorities have scrambled to stage mass evacuations away from the path of Super Cyclone Amphan, which is only the second “super cyclone” to form in the north-eastern Indian Ocean since records began.But their efforts have been hampered by the need to follow strict precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, with infection numbers still soaring in both countries.Many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods.Out at sea the vast weather system visible from space has winds of up to 240 kmh (150mph), the equivalent of a category-four hurricane. It is expected to ease slightly before crossing the coasts of West Bengal and neighbouring Bangladesh but could still be strong enough to “cause large-scale and extensive damage”, said the head of India’s weather office Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.The Indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10ft to 16-foot (3-5m)waves – as high as a two-storey house – that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.Storm surges can force a wall of water to cascade several kilometres inland, and are often responsible for massive loss of life during the most severe cyclones.Bangladesh’s low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, and India’s east are regularly battered by cyclones that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades.In 1999, the eastern state of Odisha was hit by a super cyclone that killed nearly 10,000 people. Eight years earlier, a typhoon, tornadoes and flooding killed 139,000 in Bangladesh.Bangladesh authorities fear Amphan will be the most powerful storm since Cyclone Sidr devastated the country in 2007, killing about 3,500 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.The country has been working to bring 2.2 million people to safety, while West Bengal was relocating 300,000 others.The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) aid group said people faced “an impossible choice” of braving the cyclone by staying put, or risking coronavirus infection in a shelter.Authorities in both countries said they were using extra shelter space to reduce crowding, while also making facemasks compulsory and providing extra soap and sanitiser.“We are also keeping separate isolation rooms in the shelters for any infected patients,” Bangladesh’s junior disaster management minister Enamur Rahman told AFP.Although outside the predicted direct path of the storm, there are fears for the safety of almost a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in south-eastern Bangladesh – most living in vast camps and housed in flimsy and makeshift shacks.The first coronavirus cases were reported there last week, and by Tuesday there were six confirmed infections.The UN said emergency items such as food, tarpaulins and water purification tablets had been stockpiled, while authorities said the refugees would be moved to sturdier buildings such as schools.“It will also undoubtedly increase the number of lives and livelihoods already lost to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8a6716fc98af7e943e17ba1d0d77d55b571d151/0_0_5721_3433/master/5721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9667f8dd505f19ce587d2a74383cca65","title":"uk plans for contact tracing in doubt as app not ready until june","story":"Deputy chief scientific adviser suggests track-and-trace stopped in March due to lack of capacityPlans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty as it emerged that a mobile tracking app will not be ready until June.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the app would be “rolling out in mid May” across England, but on Tuesday ministerial sources tried to downplay a system considered critical to control the disease as the country emerges from lockdown.It came as the deputy chief scientific adviser acknowledged the decision to abandon track-and-trace in March was made because of a lack of testing capacity, but said it was “the right thing to do” in the circumstances. Prof Angela McLean told the No 10 press briefing: “The advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was what was the best thing to do with the tests that we had. We could not have people in hospital with Covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had Covid.”Answering another question, she added: “At the time, with the testing we had, the right thing to do was focus it on people who were really sick in hospital, so we knew who in hospital had Covid.”George Eustice, the environment secretary, appeared to back up her view, saying: “It’s undoubtedly the case that early on we were wanting to build that capacity.”NHS insiders said the deployment of the tracking app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems. “This is a complicated thing to do and get right,” one source said.It is the latest in a string of slippages that have followed Hancock’s declaration. By the end of last week, the launch date moved back to the end of the month, and on Monday Downing Street said it would be ready “in a few weeks”.Efforts have been further complicated by the government’s insistence on deploying a centralised tracing database, which records a user’s contacts and the first half of their postcode if they declare they are ill.The NHS says it wants to be able to monitor for regional outbreaks, but that approach is not favoured by tech giants Apple and Google – who say contact data should be retained only by a person on their phone.That has forced the NHS development team to develop a string of “workarounds” to try to make the system run smoothly. A particular concern has been to ensure that the phone remains on – so the app can track connections – whilst not draining the battery.Signs of the growing difficulties were acknowledged by Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary on Tuesday morning. She conceded that children may start returning to primary school on 1 June before the app was ready. “I’m not aware that’s been set as a condition that’s necessary for the phased reopening of primary schools,” she said.A government source added that the app should be seen as “a support: a digital supplement” to human contact-tracing – and downplayed the significance of the new technology, insisting: “There’s been a bit too much focus on the app.”Privacy watchdogs also warned on Tuesday that the tracing app could hand a huge amount of personal information to the government.Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: “Given the government’s record of sharing health, education and police records with immigration enforcement, it’s alarming that it has chosen an app design that prioritises data collection – including data not needed for contact-tracing – over privacy.”Labour MP Harriet Harman, the chair of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, called for MPs to be allowed to vote on preventing government from using the data collected for other purposes – although Hancock has insisted fresh legislation is not required to get started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29849a4cbb0bc4dc59de62e698aadf9c07c748b/321_658_2304_1383/master/2304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a2eadc14502dd84b3e22f7afb0e7134","title":"wednesday briefing track and trace put back to june","story":"Contact tracing recruits struggle to log in … bill could see terror suspects watched for life … and resignation hits relaunch of Nasa human spaceflights Hello, Warren Murray with oven-ready news, just add a minute or two of your time.Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty with a mobile app not expected to be ready until June. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had said last week that it would be “rolling out in mid May” across England. NHS insiders said the deployment of the app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems. Hancock said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England. But people recruited to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 have told the  they spent days just trying to log into the online training system.The capacity of parks and outdoor facilities to accommodate socially distanced sunbathers might be tested today, which is predicted to bring the hottest weather of the year so far including a possible high of 29C in south-east England. People are allowed to meet up with one person from another household outdoors, as long as two metres’ distance is maintained. Councils have urged the public to remember that many facilities like outdoor pools and public toilets remain closed. Many tourist hotspots have asked people to stay away and said that attractions will remain closed. The majority of beaches are not currently lifeguarded although activities are allowed. Thunderstorms are predicted for Thursday.Brazil has seen its most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil, even as he called the large number of US cases a “badge of honour … It’s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.” The US has the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the US.

Abbas said the PLO and the state of Palestine “were absolved, as of today” of all their agreements with the American and Israelis. It was unclear what this would mean in practice – Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers just to move around in the West Bank. The new Israeli government is officially considering the annexations, apparently with Donald Trump’s support. The Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, is reported to have said in confidential briefings in Washington that “there is a window of opportunity now, so it must be done now … we don’t know what will happen in the US presidential elections. Biden could win.”Lifetime surveillance on terror suspects – Terrorism suspects not convicted of any offence could face expanded and permanent measures to control their lives under counter-terrorism laws proposed by the UK government. Ministers want to weaken the burden of proof for measures known as Tpims to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activity and remove a two-year limit. The new counter-terrorism bill builds on the response to terrorist attacks in the last 12 months – at Fishmongers’ Hall in the City of London and Streatham High Road in the city’s south-west – which led to scrapping of automatic release of terrorist offenders halfway through their sentences.\u0026gt Super Cyclone Amphan is bearing down on millions of people in eastern India and Bangladesh with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Bookmakers Ladbrokes is proposing to turn the last cafe on Dublin’s Moore Street, Ann’s Bakery and Restaurant, into a betting office.While there are two other bookmakers operating on the street, Paddy Power and Boyle Sports, Ann’s was the last cafe operating on the street.Local businesses, Moore Street market traders and representatives of an advisory group on the future of the street have objected to Ladbrokes’ plans.In a submission, Tom Holbrook, chairman of the Moore Street Traders Committee, said market stall holders would be “strongly opposed to having a business of this nature in Moore Street”.He said the street was “overrun with anti-social activity, eg street drinking, contraband, undesirables, loitering etc”. These problems deterred shoppers from “an already suffering street”, he said.“Moore Street is famous worldwide for its food and character. We feel this proposed business would take away from that.”Stephen Troy, a Moore Street butcher and a member of the Dublin 1 Business Alliance, said another bookmakers would have a detrimental effect on plans to develop a 1916 commemorative centre on the street.Heroes of 1916“There are plans to implement a national monument within the Moore Street terrace to commemorate the heroes and events of 1916 which will become a huge tourist attraction, and it would look absolutely hideous to have another gambling outlet adjacent to such a building.”It would also alter the character and custom base of the street, he said.Sharon Greene, appointed to the expert group to advise on market management, said a “good ersity of retail uses” is needed to draw customers to markets, and cafes in particular caused them to “linger” in the area.“For this reason I would strongly oppose the change of use sought for a Ladbrokes betting shop on Moore Street, which would bring the number of betting shops on the street to three.”‘Vitality and vibrancy’In their planning application to Dublin City Council, consultants acting on behalf of Ladbrokes said another bookmakers on Moore Street would not constitute an intensification or proliferation of betting shops in the area“Betting offices represent an appropriate city centre service which serves to attract people into the area and add to the mix of uses which we submit will aid the vitality and vibrancy of the area.”While Ann’s Bakery is closing its Moore Street outlet, it remains in business on Mary Street and North Earl Street.The building, which is part of the Ilac centre, is owned by UK property group Hammerson which plans to develop a mixed-use retail, office, hotel and residential scheme on the opposite side of Moore Street, and Irish Life Assurance plc. The companies granted consent to Ladbrokes to make the application.A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht said the Ladbrokes application related to a “modern commercial building” and therefor the proposed change of use was a matter solely for the city council to determine.Submissions on the application can be made to the council until June 25th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4257536.1589908281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers must declare conflicts of interest when grading leaving cert students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers’ unions and principals were consulting with the Department  on Tuesday over the final details of the official guidance which is due to be issued to thousands of teachers in the country’s 700-plus secondary schools this week. Photograph: Mark StedmanRollingNews.ieTeachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.School principals are also likely to be required to confirm that assessment grades and the rank order of students in a class are a true representation of student performance, according to sources.Teachers’ unions and principals were consulting with the Department of Education on Tuesday over the final details of the official guidance which is due to be issued to thousands of teachers in the country’s 700-plus secondary schools this week.Calculated gradesFollowing the Government decision earlier this month to cancel the summer Leaving Cert exams, more than 60,000 students are set to receive calculated grades for the first time based on teachers’ estimates.Under this approach, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank over for their class.The guidance is understood to state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.In order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to per centages.These grades will then be sent to the Department of Education where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.It will also review the performance of this year’s group of students against their overall performance at Junior Cycle level.This, the department says, will allow it to check whether the estimated percentage marks in each subject in the school are reasonable. These marks may be aligned upwards or downwards, accordingly.Inappropriate contactThe guidance is also expected to state that any attempt to offer teachers gifts or inducements in relation to students’ results will also be treated as a “serious attempt”to interfere with an entire school’s grades.Unions have also been pushing for a protocol to be included in the guidance which states that any inappropriate contact with teachers or schools will be formally recorded and forwarded to the department.Latest guidance from the department states that parents or students must not under any circumstances contact, directly or indirectly, a teacher or other staff member to discuss estimated marks or class rankings.“Such contact would be regarded as totally inappropriate and a serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity required of teachers and schools in the assigning of estimated marks and ranking for the inidual student concerned and for the students in the school as a whole,” according to new department guidance.It also says any attempt by teachers to allow discussion of estimated grades before the process is complete would interfere with the process being carried out properly and fairly.If teachers discuss the marks with some students but not others, or if some teachers did this and others did not, these discussions might actually influence or be construed as influencing the mark the teacher submits to the subject alignment group.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan Betson Women in paid employment have better outcomes in pregnancy and improved lifestyle behaviours during it compared to homemakers, major new Irish research has found.Women who were unemployed or homemakers had higher incidences of low birth weight and size, and their babies were more likely to be admitted to the neonatal unit, than women in paid employment, according to the study of over 62,000 Irish women.In addition, women who were homemakers had an increased incidence of neonatal death, while among unemployed women the rate of stillbirth was higher, compared to women in paid work.The unemployed and homemaker cohorts were less likely to plan their pregnancy and to take folic acid before conception, and more likely to continue smoking and use illicit drugs during pregnancy, the researchers from UCD and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital found.Observational studyEven after adjusting for continued adverse lifestyle behaviours during pregnancy, the association with adverse outcomes persisted.The observational study was based on the outcomes for more than 62,000 women who gave birth at the Coombe between 2010 and 2017. One of the largest maternity hospitals in Europe, the Coombe sees a erse mix of patients in terms of socio-economic background.The authors say their study challenges previous results and assumptions that homemakers provide the best scenario for desired foetal development.“In some cases, such as those working in factories, mining and construction this may be true, however we found that when comparing women in paid employment as a whole to homemakers, these women had not only improved pregnancy outcomes but also improved lifestyle and pregnancy-related behaviours.”Maternal employmentWhile the link between unemployment and poorer pregnancy outcomes is well-established, the Irish research sheds new light on outcomes for homemaker women.“It does suggest that, depending on the type, work can be good for you, in terms of pregnancy outcomes,” says Prof Michael Turner of UCD’s Centre for Human Reproduction. “It brings in income to provide for you and your family you eat better, exercise more and may be able to employ carers for other children.”“Society may need to see what it can do to increase maternal employment,” Prof Turner says, adding that this question is particularly relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic, as unemployment, including female unemployment, increases again.However, he acknowledges the homemaker group is a erse one that includes women who were on social welfare benefits before their pregnancy and women who are well-supported financially and who consciously chose to stop working before having children.A possible weakness of the study is that information on employment status from women is self-reported, the authors acknowledge."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"James Hayes (17) wins prize for imaginative essay on the man who discovered QuaternionsCoronavirus: Plans aimed at helping maintain social distancing as city re-opensD\u0026aacuteil vote due as Covid-19 outlay likely to deplete \u0026euro8.6bn budget by June, Donohoe warnsResearch challenges ideas around best scenario for desired foetal developmentDeputy leader Catherine Martin urged to try unseat incumbent from top roleScientific expert group raised concerns over effectiveness, preferring medical masksProf Mary Horgan, who worked with Aids victims in US, cautions against stigmatisingDealgan House had to rely on a volunteer, the grand-daughter of resident, to staff phonesLadbrokes plan would replace Ann\u0026rsquos Bakery with third bookies outlet on historic streetThousands of nurses and doctors from abroad form backbone of our Covid-19 battleLast year Peter Tyndall\u0026rsquos office received the highest number of complaints since 2010Dissident republicans and Ulster Defence Association members made threats recentlyThe number of cases in meat plants has increased by more than 300 to 828Operation on HNoMS Thor Heyerdahl 300 kms off Cork at limit of helicopter\u0026rsquos rangeIrish State alleges Lee Canavan was gunman in 2016 killing of David \u0026lsquoDaithi\u0026rsquo DouglasMove follows Dr Tony Holohan\u0026rsquos description of the practice as \u0026lsquoa breach of confidentiality\u0026rsquoConcerns some operations will not be able to offer services in six months timeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258037.1589956860!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork city set to pedestrianise streets and increase cycle paths","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork city is set to pedestrianise many of its streets as it reopens during the coronavirus crisis. File photograph: Bryan O’Brien The . Cork city is set to pedestrianise many of its streets and provide additional cycling facilities as part of a city council’s strategy aimed at facilitating social distancing to allow the city reopen during the coronavirus crisis. According to Cork City Council, the first phase of re-opening of the city involved the pedestrianisation of the Marina near Páirc Uí Chaoimh and the re-introduction of pedestrianisation on Oliver Plunkett Street in the city centre.As part of the second phase of re-opening the city, Cork City Council is proposing the pedestrianisation of Emmet Place, Father Matthew Street, Fitton Street East, Liberty Street, Cross Street, Castle Street and Daunts Square. The council is also looking at expediting snagging work on Harley Street between Patrick’s Quay and MacCurtain Street to facilitate pedestrians using the street once again following the construction of the Mary Elmes Bridge. Cork City Council is also looking at making a number of existing pedestrianised streets one way with Tobin Street, French Church Street and Carey’s Lane all currently being examined as possible one-way movement streets.The option of encouraging pedestrians to move on the right side is also being considered for several pedestrianised bridges including Mary Elmes Bridge, Shandon Bridge, St Vincent’s Bridge, Trinity Bridge and Nano Nagle Bridge. “There will be no impediment on pedestrian movement (on these bridges) but like the London Underground, pedestrians will be encouraged to walk on the right,” said a Cork City Council spokeswoman.CyclingMeanwhile new bike stands are to be located at 43 new locations around the city including several in the city centre as well as in Blackpool and Douglas to encourage people to consider cycling. The city council is also examining the possibility of introducing new bike stands in surrounding towns and villages such as Ballincollig, Tower, Glanmire and Blarney which were incorporated into an expanded city in May 2019.Key cycling routes into the city are under review to identify any improvements to cycling infrastructure that could be implemented while opportunities to convert sites to ‘Park \u0026amp Walk’ facilities are being investigated. Cork City Council Assistant Chief Executive Brian Geaney said the plan has been prepared in conjunction with the government’s re-opening road map for the country as a whole over the next few weeks.Cork City Council also utilised the Cork politan Area Transport Strategy (CMATS) and Cork City Centre Movement Strategy (CCMS) as part of the overriding framework to help revitalise the city.“First and foremost, we want residents, workers and visitors to the city to feel that they can safely practice social distancing in our city and that it is an attractive place to visit during these unusual times.“We started with the city centre but are looking out to the wider new city. Our approach protects health and wellbeing but all proposed interventions will need to be fully considered by all stakeholder interest groups in the city.”Mr Geaney said the Covid 19 pandemic had provided Cork City Council with an opportunity to review its management of the city and rethink the future of the city in a way that boosts quality of life, sustainability and opportunity.“While we are informed by other Irish and international cities, Cork is unique in the way that its homes, workplaces, retail and hospitality are configured and so we need a unique response,” he said. “A street-by-street approach will be adopted in relation to particular on-street proposals. Cork City Council will seek unanimity of purpose as specific mobility measures are proposed for various streets,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4257336.1589897521!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"golf club told to cancel tee times for members breaching 5km restriction","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCahir Park Golf Club has informed distant members - defined as those living more than 40km away - who have booked tee times that they can no longer play while Covid-19 restrictions remain in place.

We have no sympathy for those who have tried to break the guidelines.”In the email sent to distant members, Mr Costello said the gardaí had told the club that it was “unacceptable” for them to play and warned it to “ensure this does not happen”.He added: “In view of this instruction we have no alternative but to remove distant members from the BRS booking system with immediate effect. We do hope that you understand the action we have had to take. Each members that has a current booking will be phoned by the club to clarify the situation.”The BRS system is a popular software system in Irish golf clubs which allows members to book tee times.Mr Costello told The  that the club has at all times sought to stress to members the importance of maintaining the 5km rule and pointed to a number of emails that he sent members to that effect.However, he added: “”I think we have been a pretty good model for golf clubs. We can’t police everybody. That’s not our job.“We have put a lot of effort putting over our message about the 5km and it is a difficult message and also getting over all the protocols you have to put in place.“You have to look at the infrastructure of the club and a golf club is more challenged now than it has ever been.”Mr Costello says he practices what he preaches as he lives eight kilometres away from the club and has not set foot in it since March 24th. “It’s a huge frustration and I have things to do with regard to employment and I having to do it all at home, but that’s my commitment to Covid-19 and the golf course.”“Where potential breaches of the public health regulations are identified, and where a person does not come into compliance with the regulations, a file is submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction as to how to proceed.”When asked if other golf courses had been contacted in a similar way by gardaí, the spokesman said the force had “no further comment” to make.Golfing Union of Ireland spokesman Alan Kelly said it had told golfers from “day one” that golf club members must comply with the travel restrictionsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4257556.1589909511!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lockdown works in mysterious ways in the most beautiful town in france","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTwo worshippers, Guillaume and Cynthia,  put on their as they prepare to enter the reopened Notre Dame de Chartres cathedral in central France on May 14th.

They would be required to wear masks. Fifty could enter at a time, if they observed social distancing.The rules changed overnight. The prefecture, the arm of the interior ministry which is responsible for religious affairs, grew alarmed at the prospect of Parisians flocking to the beauty spot 86km to the southwest of the capital.“This is the contradiction we’ve been living with since the beginning of the epidemic,” Fr Emmanuel Blondeau (56), the rector and parish priest, said. “The state says: ‘Stay at home but go to work.

We didn’t even have a newsletter. We’d never had a televised Mass before. We created a YouTube channel.”The cathedral has broadcast Mass live every Sunday since mid-March. In normal times, up to 1,500 attend services. Now 2,000 click on the parish website, and several are presumably watching in many households. The videos are also available on demand from France’s main telecoms operators.Fr Blondeau estimates up to 20,000 people are watching, and he’s thrilled by the surge in his ratings. “Eighty people used to attend morning Mass on weekdays. From the feedback I get, I think about 1,000 listen on radio.”But relations between church and state have hit a low point. When prime minister Édouard Philippe announced the partial lifting of the lockdown, he banned religious ceremonies at least until June 2nd.“They don’t understand what Mass means to Christians,” Fr Blondeau says. “They think it doesn’t matter, but it matters to us. Parishioners are deeply wounded by the lack of freedom. They feel disrespected.”Fr Blondeau could understand, as long as the entire population was isolated. Since May 11th, he says, there has been discrimination against believers. The rules imposed on the cathedral seem disproportionate, especially when one considers the crowds in French supermarkets.Religious freedomOn the evening of May 18th, the Council of State, France’s highest administrative jurisdiction, ruled that the ban on religious ceremonies constitutes “a serious and obviously illegal” attack on religious freedom. It ordered the government to lift the ban within eight days.“I’m eager to say Mass in front of people with faces, instead of empty chairs,” Fr Blondeau says. The Conference of Bishops and the leaders of the Jewish, Muslim and Protestant faiths are now negotiating conditions for resuming religious services.It will be too late for Ascension Day on Thursday. But Fr Blondeau thinks 30 per cent occupancy, or 500 worshippers in Chartres cathedral, would be a reasonable figure. He hopes to hold normal services for the Feast of the Pentecost on May 31st.Patrick Delabre, the cathedral’s organist, will play for the Ascension and Pentecost Masses, whether they are televised or attended by the faithful.Though he is isolated in the 10-metre by 12-metre organ loft, Delabre (67) thought it wise to stay home from mid-March. He feared catching Covid-19, or spreading the virus.“If I weren’t a believer I couldn’t do this job,” Delabre says. “There’s a commitment to the flow of the liturgy, a receptiveness. You have to feel it.”Delabre and his wife, also an organist, practised for up to five hours a day on their home keyboards during the lockdown. “I was able to channel my anxiety,” he says. “You forget the outside world. You are alone with yourself. I improvised a lot during this period.”Delabre doesn’t know yet what music he will play for the feast days. “Things have been so morbid. I think people will want something luminous,” he says.Since he is a believer, I ask Delabre why does he think God allowed the pandemic to happen. “He doesn’t have power over events,” the organist replies thoughtfully. “The existence of God is essentially about a personal relationship.”To go from the sacred to the profane, one has only to cross the square in front of the cathedral, to the offices of Cosmetic Valley, the association of France’s 3,200 cosmetic and perfume-makers.Perfume heirThey are largely responsible for the economic revival of the town of 40,000. The move to the west of Paris was pioneered by the perfume heir Jean-Paul Guerlain, who wanted his factory to be near his country home at Rambouillet. Others followed.Today, the €45 billion cosmetic and perfume industry – the country’s second-largest – is concentrated in a crescent running from Normandy through Chartres and down to Tours.Cosmetic Valley’s members “showed incredible adaptability”, says deputy chief executive officer Soline Godet (44). “Within two weeks, 80 of our companies started producing hydroalcoholic gel. Hospitals were calling us, asking us for supplies.”When perfume and cosmetic factories ran short of ethanol, they turned to French champagne and cognac makers.Despite their inventiveness, the cosmetic and perfume manufacturers lost two months of exports to Asia, mainly China, their biggest market. And though none shut down completely, plants slowed production throughout the lockdown. Cosmetic Valley will hold a “states-general” for 500 executives from the industry in an auditorium at the Louvre in October, to consider the way forward.A few miles away, Nelly Moreau (67) serves customers in the Pharmacie de la Cité. A businesswoman who is active in the local Rotary club, Moreau has worked in the mostly Arab and African banlieue for 30 years. There was rioting in 2005. One of the killers in the 2015 Bataclan massacre was an Arab youth from a similar neighbourhood in Chartres.Moreau, like the majority of the people I talk to, fears the government may reimpose the lockdown if there is a second wave of infections.“I was in town this morning,” she says. “Most people wear masks. But the 18- to 20-year-olds aren’t responsible. They didn’t see each other for months and now they want to celebrate. They’re all meeting on the Place des Épars.”When I drove past the square, I saw youths skateboarding and sitting on crowded benches.“Our generation is more reasonable,” Moreau sighs. Yet she has compassion for the young, living under the threat of disease and economic disaster.“Our generation was really lucky,” Moreau reflects. “We never knew invasion and occupation. We had 30 years of prosperity. We had an extraordinary life, and we didn’t even know it.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bma drops opposition schools reopening","story":"The British Medical Association has said schools can reopen on June 1, or earlier, as long as it is “safe to do so”.In an apparent softening of its stance regarding pupils returning to the classroom, the doctors’ union admitted there was “growing evidence that the risk to inidual children from Covid-19 is extremely small”.However, it cautioned that there was still no consensus on how easily children could spread the disease to vulnerable adults.Tensions between the Government and teaching unions over plans for classes to return were raised further on Tuesday night as the National Education Union said that, as things stood, no school was safe to reopen on June 1. The BMA was dragged into the row when Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, wrote a letter of support to the NEU after it advised teachers “not to engage” with the Government’s plans to reopen schools after next week’s half term break.However, writing for The  to clarify the body’s position, Dr Peter English, the chairman of the BMA’s Public Health Medicine Committee, says: “The BMA wants schools to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so and the evidence allows – this could be before June 1 or after. A zero-risk approach is not possible. This is about ‘safe’ being an acceptable level of risk.”In his letter to Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the NEU, which has 450,000 members, Dr Nagpaul had said the BMA was “completely aligned” with the union and that teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution, saying: “Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.”However, The  understands some members of the BMA were “uncomfortable” with how strongly Dr Nagpaul had worded his letter.Mr Courtney on Tuesday night refused to back down, saying: “Our current assessment is that schools aren’t safe to open, as our five tests have not been met. But if our five tests are met, then on a national level, it would be permissible to go ahead with reopening schools.”The NEU’s five tests include a lowering of the number of virus cases, plans for social distancing, more testing, strategies for entire schools and protection for the vulnerable.Solihull became the first Tory-led council to question the June 1 date on Tuesday. Leaders of Birmingham City Council also signalled their dissent, saying they would support schools opening to more pupils only “when it is safe to do so”.Liverpool, Hartlepool and Calderdale councils have already announced that they will advise their schools against opening next month on the basis that it remains unsafe.The Government on Tuesday reiterated that every school’s circumstances were different and that if a head teacher felt unable to open next month, they should “discuss options” with their local authority or trust.Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific adviser, appeared to confirm that a decision on schools reopening would be made on Wednesday. However, in a marked departure from Government policy, she also said schools should not reopen until the track-and-trace system was up and running.She said: “Scientists have been very clear in our advice that changes to lockdown, as we modelled them, need a highly effective track, trace and isolate system to be in place.“We’re also very clear that any change to social distancing measures should be based upon observed levels of incidents in places that there is going to be change, not on a fixed date.”It also emerged on Tuesday that one of the NEU bosses had admitted that her hardline stance was just a “negotiating position” after the Government left the union out of the decision making process. Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the union, said that while its “public” position was that it was not engaging with plans to reopen schools on June 1, this could change in the future.Meanwhile, Mr Courtney said that as part of an “escalation procedure”, the NEU would “threaten” to name and shame on social media head teachers who it believed were “putting lives at risk”.Speaking to NEU officers via video conferencing at a meeting last Thursday, Dr Bousted said: “I am going to trust you to keep what is obviously going to be confidential, confidential. We do have to be careful if we are going to tell you what’s going on we have to trust you not to spill the beans when it is clearly a negotiating position.”Footage of the meeting was published on the NEU’s YouTube channel.Dr Bousted told the NEU’s officers that the union’s stance currently had the support of parents, but she warned this could not be counted on forever.She added: “It’s not that we will never negotiate on schools reopening. We want our five tests met, we want to see the science, and if you start treating us seriously we will start to negotiate. But not now, you have not treated us seriously and our position at the moment is that we are not negotiating a return on June 1.”A DfE spokesman said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being.“We have engaged closely with a range of relevant organisations, including the unions, throughout the past eight weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the Government’s scientific advisers last Friday, and will continue to do so.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"come boris get us thislockdown hole late","story":"The Germans called it the Luftbrücke, an air bridge to take supplies to West Berlin, separated from the rest of the country after the war by the Soviet occupation in the east. With its image of isolation and vulnerability, it is an unfortunate description for what the UK is considering to mitigate the impact of a 14-day quarantine on visitors due to be announced later this week.If this country has been anything down the centuries, it has been open to the world, too open, say some. To cut ourselves off just as our neighbours in Europe are dusting down the café tables and putting out the beach parasols seems bizarre to say the least. Post-Brexit we intended to be global now we are North Korea.If we were in the midst of a plague, this might be sensible and, to be fair, from the start the Government has had to prepare for what its disaster plans call the “reasonable worst-case scenario”. Had you or I been confronted with statistical modelling suggesting that if certain action was not taken, 500,000 people would die and we would be blamed, what would we have done?Of course, it was possible to resist a lockdown and, looking at Sweden, that might have worked had the British responded in the same way. But politically it became impossible for Boris Johnson to hold the line. I get that. The difficulty now, however, is that it is far harder to get people to reclaim their liberties than it was to take them away.The quarantine fiasco is a case in point. It may look good on a graph of projected infections in the months ahead to keep visitors under lock and key, but its first contact with reality exposes its weakness.It means the UK being seen internationally as a place to shun, not to embrace. Who would possibly want that?A better way, surely, would be to test people at the airport and if they have symptoms then they cannot travel. There has to be an alternative, otherwise great chunks of the tourism industry, which accounts for 10 per cent of the economy, are doomed.Even if travel does get going again soon, the social distancing rules (and why are we required to separate by two metres when the World Health Organisation guideline is one metre?) means planes will be only one third full, and therefore prohibitively expensive. The queues at airports, already onerous, will be intolerable.The chief executive of Heathrow estimated that if passengers are made to socially distance by two metres to board a jumbo jet, the line would stretch for half a mile – after you have checked in and gone through security on the same basis.Arriving at the airport more than two hours before a flight always seemed ludicrously early. Now it will be four or even five hours of faffing about. It will take longer than most flights just to get on the wretched aircraft.Mass transit flying does not lend itself to keeping people apart. The economic model is predicated upon cramming us all in. It is not surprising that Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair, is lashing out at the proposed quarantine because it spells the end of his business and that of other airlines.Mr O’Leary is that rare beast in the corporate world, an executive who is not scared to speak his mind, and who does not look over his shoulder at the pursuing Twitterati and its accompanying army of moralistic tut-tutters. He tells it as he sees it and what he sees is a disaster, one caused not by the virus but by the response. He accused the Government of “making stuff up as they go along” and sometimes it is hard to disagree with that observation.One day we are told face masks are pointless the next they are recommended in enclosed spaces. We are urged to go back to work, but then asked not to travel there on public transport. People are encouraged to get some fresh air only to find the countryside dotted with “keep out” signs, as though it belongs to the people who live near it.Patricia Yates, boss of the now-ironically named quango Visit Britain, told a Commons select committee yesterday that business may not be back to normal for two or three years because of a lack of consumer confidence, especially among families and older people. Given that the vast majority of people, even if they contract the virus, will be affected only mildly, the fear is completely out of proportion to the threat. But whose fault is that?The nation desperately needs the bold leadership out of this mess that we thought Boris Johnson could be relied on to provide. Worried about the inevitable search for culprits, our tight-knit Government is too diffident.As an election winner and a Covid victim, the Prime Minister has the political and moral authority to look the country in the eye and say that the risks for the great majority are smaller than had been feared and that, provided we protect the vulnerable, we can get back to normal. Not baby steps, but big leaps forward. Come on, Boris: lead us out of this.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keep distance new coronavirus slogan quietly pushed replace","story":"The Government has begun using a new slogan in its coronavirus response following criticism that its Stay Alert message was too vague.It is advising the public to Keep our distance, wash our hands, think of others and play our part. All together.Advertisements bearing the new message started appearing yesterday, together with an image of a rainbow, which has come to represent the public\u0027s gratitude to NHS and care workers during the crisis.The new slogan, released without fanfare, was described by government sources as part of a wider public information campaign around the Stay Alert message, which replaced the more direct Stay Home message.The most recent mantra appears against an amber background, a colour recognised as meaning caution because of its use in traffic lights. Questions had been raised about why the red border around the Stay Home message - clearly indicating danger - had been replaced with a green border for Stay Alert.Opinion polls have shown that only a third of the public claim to understand what Stay Alert means.On May 10, the highly effective Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives message was replaced with Stay Alert. Control the Virus. Save Lives.On the same day, Boris Johnson announced the easing of some lockdown measures by allowing people more freedom to roam outside, play sports and return to work.While 91 per cent of people said they were clear on what Stay Home meant, just 30 per cent of people surveyed the day after Stay Alert was introduced said they knew what it meant.It left the Prime Minister appealing to good British common sense when it came to people deciding what they should and should not do under the new rules.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rspb volunteers repatriated remote island 12 day boat journey","story":"Among the thousands of enforced journeys home from abroad when the coronavirus crisis hit, few would have been as arduous as that made by a group of bird charity volunteers.Twelve RSPB conservationists, including three Britons, had been looking after the rare albatrosses on Gough Island, one of the most remote locations in the world, around 1,700 miles off the southern tip of Africa.The British Overseas Territory, home to 24 species of rare bird, is overrun with giant mice, which eat the eggs and kill young birds, wiping out as many as two million a year. The rangers had been laying pest poison, and monitoring the unusual animals on Gough.When the crisis broke, they contacted the Foreign Office, and officials worked out an 18-day route, the quickest available, involving first abseiling down the steep cliffs of Gough, then a 12-day sea voyage of nearly 2,000 nautical miles before a five-day layover on Ascension Island waiting to be airlifted back to Brize Norton – via Cape Verde.Kate Lawrence, one of the group, said: “Sailing in that boat for 12 days, looking at the endless blue ocean around me, made the world feel quite big, in contrast to the previous ease of air travel, and the rapid spread of Covid-19, which makes the world seem so small.”When the stranded group originally requested help, multiple routes for them to return home were considered. As the closest, South Africa was the most obvious destination, but rapidly developing travel restrictions there soon ruled it out.The Falklands were seen as the next-best option, but it was at least a 20-day sail away on the expedition yacht, the Evohe, against prevailing winds, and in deteriorating weather conditions.Ms Lawrence added: “We knew the team back in the UK were working on a plan, though the information and plan seemed to change almost daily due to the ever-changing border closures and travel restrictions around the world.”Andrew Callender, programme executive of the RSPB Gough Project, said: “We received incredible support throughout the repatriation process from members of the FCO, the High Commissioner in South Africa and various administrators and representatives of the Overseas Territories, especially in the Falklands and Ascension.”Despite their exhausting and stressful journey, the team hopes to return to Gough next year to save the critically endangered Tristan Albatross from the mice, which were accidentally introduced by humans.They are hoping to raise the finance to continue the mission to eradicate the rodents entirely from the island.Michelle Risi, who works for the RSPB and lives permanently on the island, said: “It was amazing to see how people from all around the world united and bonded. Unfortunately, this time has now come to an end. For us remaining, we are sorry to see their friendly faces go as we prepare for another winter on Gough, which will unfortunately consist of documenting another year of mice impact on Gough’s winter breeders.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories need confront lockdowns seismic impact young","story":"At the very start of this crisis my former MEP colleague Ann Widdecombe, in usual firebrand fashion, was adamant that the best way to deal with Covid-19 was to shield those that needed protection while the young and healthy kept the economy afloat.At the time, under the spectre of a novel virus stalking the continent as lockdown swept across Europe, it could have been construed as an audacious approach from the bold septuagenarian. Now it appears she was on to something.A report released this week by the Resolution Foundation shows under 25s are more likely to suffer the economic effects of this crisis. One in three have been furloughed or lost jobs completely, or have seen pay reduced. The sort of businesses with predominantly youthful workforces are in the hospitality and retail sectors.With bars, restaurants and shops closed for two months and no clear indication of when they may reopen and under what limitations, waiting staff and shop assistants up and down the country may no longer have jobs to go back to.What’s more, workplaces facing financial struggle under future economic fallout may be looking to cut staff and wages. The adage of ‘last in, first out’ could see senior and more experienced workers with far more accrued employment rights have positions protected, while junior staff walking the tightrope of proving themselves before passing the threshold for certain benefits, discover they are more disposable.But it’s not only in the workplace that the young bear a major cost. A generation of school children, university students and apprentices are being forced to forego the education vital for their future employment before entering what could turn out to be a ravaged economy where jobs are few and far between.Tomorrow’s taxpayers will also be forced to pick up the tab for the massive spend furloughing has required while facing a frightened lending market leaving mortgages further from reach. Flights, rents and a multitude of other costs could inflate to paper over losses for years to come. The gap that already exists between Boomers and their babies is potentially set to widen.When you put that in the context of Covid-19 morbidity, where fewer than 1pc of casualties under forty and the majority of deaths among those over 80, you realise that Government policy, which locked down healthy members of the workforce while allowing Covid-19 to rampage through care homes, may have gotten this very wrong.In the West, the population pyramid is an inverse triangle with a limited number of young bearing the burden of an ageing population. Most European Governments’ Covid-19 responses will necessitate borrowing from tomorrow’s workers to protect the retired population of today. Yet tomorrow’s prosperity comes with no guarantees in the resulting recession Covid-19 will bring.The generational wealth gap has been a hot topic among young, often Left-wing voters for a long time, future voters every party needs to reach. While the Conservatives are often accused of forging pensioner-centric policies, taking advantage of their number and propensity to vote, any prospective government must find solutions for a unique generation facing eye-watering student debt and little personal capital. Add to that higher taxes and mounting unemployment, and you realise that the lasting effects of Covid-19 is on those least likely to suffer the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"science behind three key coronavirus rules does stack","story":"The easing of the UK lockdown will change the way in which we go about our daily lives, with new restrictions placed on travelling, visiting shops and touching objects.But are these restrictions justified, and where did they come from?The two-metre social distancing rule dates back to experiments by Harvard scientist Willam Wells, who was looking at the contagiousness of tuberculosis in the 1930s.Wells found that viruses causing respiratory infections are spread by different-sized droplets expelled by coughs and sneezes. Just one single droplet can be enough to carry an infectious dose and recent research has demonstrated the distances droplets can travel, as shown here:At the beginning of March, the Department of Health released guidance on social distancing warning that coronavirus can be spread when people have close, sustained contact, which typically means spending more than 15 minutes or longer within two metres of an infected person.The new contact tracing app is likely to apply a similar distance and time frame when determining whether people have been in close contact.  However, the 15-minute rule appears to have been lost somewhere in the recent guidance, even though there is no evidence to suggest anyone has ever caught the virus by briefly passing someone when out and about.The World Health Organisation advises a distance of one metre, but other countries have given different guidance:On Tuesday, former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned whether Britain should lower its social distancing advice.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, he said: We\u0027re the only country, certainly in Europe, that I know of that uses the two-metre rule.I think when it comes to the hospitality sector, I think we do need to look at it very carefully.The Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, recently told the health select committee: The risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres. This gives you an idea of why the two-metre rule becomes important.Transmission depends on both the amount of virus present and the duration and method of exposure.The Government Office for Science says two metres is an instance in which risk drops to an acceptable level for face-to-face interactions such as talking. In this case, a six-second exposure at one metre is comparable to a one minute exposure at two metres.However, being exposed to a cough is significantly more risky than talking to someone.  Exposure at two mteres is comparable to talking for one minute at a one-metre distance and talking for 30 minutes at a two-metre distance.Bookshops have said novels will need to be taken off shelves for three days if they have been flicked through by customers.Surface contamination is a major problem for the spread of coronavirus, and is probably where the vast majority of the new infections are happening. Professor Chris Whitty, England\u0027s chief medical officer, has previously warned that there will be some risk of transmission from touching hard surfaces for up to 72 hours.Humans touch their faces an average of 23 times a day while awake, so the risk of inadvertently transferring a virus through the mouth, eyes or nose is quite high if people are not washing their hands regularly. Non-porous surfaces such as doorknobs, mobile phones, railings and tabletops are better at carrying viruses in general, while every surface has a different half life (the time it takes for the virus cells to degrade by half):A study by the University of Hong Kong, published in The Lancet in April, found the virus lasted longest on stainless steel, plastic, and surgical masks, where it lingered for seven days.The life of the virus was tested in average room temperature of 71F (21C)  at 65 per cent relative humidity, mirroring conditions in the home.Within three hours, it had disappeared from printing and tissue paper but it took two days to die on wood or fabric and four days before it was no longer detectable on glass or paper money. Porous surfaces do not allow viruses to survive as long because the small spaces or holes in them can trap them and stop them from moving.Somewhat worryingly, the team found that, of all the materials tested, coronavirus lasted longest on the outer layer of a surgical mask. John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told members of the House of Lords on Tuesday: There are certain surfaces where the virus can persist for longer, such as metal.Typically with cloth surfaces, the viruses don\u0027 persist as long. At room temperature indoors, the virus can persist for 24 hours or more. Outside is a very different matter. Outside the virus can persist for minutes.The two-week quarantine window was based on the scientific evidence from China that the incubation period before coronavirus symptoms appeared could be as long as 14 days.The timeframe is determined by how long it takes viruses to invade cells in the body and then replicate. Once a virus infects a person, it takes several days to reproduce sufficiently for the host to begin shedding the virus through coughs or sneezes. The incubation period varies from virus to virus, and sometimes from host to host.During early analysis of coronavirus, scientists found that the typical incubation period was around five days, and around 97 per cent of people who got infected developed symptoms within 11 to 12 days. By two weeks, 99 per cent of infected people were displaying symptoms. So it is generally thought that, if symptoms have not appeared within 14 days, it is highly likely that a person is not infected, which is why the Government instructed the following advice and timelines for households concerning self-isolation:On January 27, the Foreign Office issued advice warning travellers who had returned from Wuhan in the previous 14 days to self-isolate. Britons who had been evacuated from the Chinese city were also placed in a 14-day quarantine, and now people returning to the UK will need to stay indoors for two weeks in case symptoms develop.However since those calculations were carried out in January and February, scientists now know that many infected people never show symptoms at all and it is unclear how long they remain infectious. Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said: The vast majority of cases are very mild, and therefore that has given the virus the opportunity to transmit in human populations without people realising it\u0027s around.Chinese research has shown that some patients have been infectious for 37 days.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/20/07/ruby-rose.jpg","title":"batwoman ruby rose s2 recast lead kate kane dc","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘This was not a decision I made lightly’ said the actorThe CW superhero series Batwoman is looking for a new lead after actor, Ruby Rose, decided to leave the show after just one season.Rose played the title character of Batwoman, aka Kate Kane, a masked crime-fighter who cleans up the streets of Gotham City.“I have made the very difficult decision to not return to ‘Batwoman’ next season,” said the Australian actor in a statement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This was not a decision I made lightly as I have the utmost respect for the cast, crew and everyone involved with the show in both Vancouver and in Los Angeles,” she continued.“I am beyond appreciative to Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and Caroline Dries for not only giving me this incredible opportunity, but for welcoming me into the DC universe they have so beautifully created.”What the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s artConvenience Store Woman is a gothic love story with a capitalist kink‘He was in another league’ – Joy Division on the death of Ian CurtisEarlier this year, a crew member working on the series was paralysed from the waist down following an on-set accident.Rose herself also herniated two discs in her back during filming, and had to undergo surgery or she would be ”risking paralysis”.

A rise of 50,000 to 1.3 million out of work is entirely manageable and we entered the coronavirus pandemic with very high levels of employment anyway – even if average pay packets have barely risen in a decade.We also know that the job retention scheme, the central pillar of the government’s measures to mitigate the fallout of coronavirus, is working. Without it the unemployment number would now be much, much higher. Millions of productive ties between employer and employee would have been severed and millions of people’s incomes would have fallen much more sharply. The economic blow of coronavirus has been softened significantly.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnfortunately, that’s about where the good news ends.The top-line figures are for January to March, before the economic effects of coronavirus fully kicked in. The early signs for April are much more concerning. The benefit claimant count shot up by 856,000 to 2.1 million to its highest level since 1996. Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Close to a quarter of the labour force is now on furlough, meaning they are off work while the government covers 80 per cent of their salary up to £2,500 a month.That’s a good thing in the short term because it keeps money in people’s pockets and keeps connections between employees and their jobs. But, in many respects – indeed, by some official definitions – someone on furlough is unemployed. We know that lengthy periods out of work can have permanent impacts on somebody’s future job prospects, quality of life, mental health and productivity. Economists refer to these longer-term impacts that stretch out after a recession as “scarring”. The effects of an extended period of joblessness tend to be particularly noticeable if it happens when someone is young. People aged 18 to 30 have been disproportionately put out of work by the pandemic, whether they’re on furlough or unemployed. They largely fill the jobs that have been lost on shop floors, waiting restaurant tables and pulling pints in pubs.Many of those jobs, along with those lost in tourism and other hard-hit sectors, will not come back soon. The reality is that, even when the economy “opens up”, it cannot go back to business as usual and it won’t get anything close to how it was before until effective treatments or a vaccine are found and produced in large quantities.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No one has yet put forward a credible plan for a socially distanced passenger flight, given that air circulates around a cabin containing hundreds of people for hours. Testing every passenger will entail huge queues at airports and much reduced capacity. Lots of people may be wary of flying in any case.Pubs and restaurants ran on tight margins before the crisis. Many say they won’t survive if they have to seat people two metres apart and close off some tables. Would anyone want to go to a socially distanced nightclub? It would seem to defeat the point of the whole exercise.This means that, without the right intervention, millions of people will be unemployed when the furlough scheme ends.So what is the right intervention? No one can claim to know the definitive answer to that question yet. However, consensus is beginning to build around a few important measures.UK unemployment surged to 1.3m in first three months of yearFirst, the sectors most under threat need renewed support. Does the government want to protect as much of the UK’s tourism, hospitality and airline industries as it can until the economy can fully restart? Or will it let it go to the wall? Given that those industries may not reach full capacity for two years or more, some analysts have advocated what amounts to a government bailout, with the state taking an equity stake in businesses or giving them direct grants. Keeping thousands of hospitality and airline workers on furlough who will not have a job to go back to for a couple of years is not feasible. But leaving them to fend for themselves when there are few, if any, relevant job vacancies, would be unconscionable.Therefore, we need planning and detailed research to estimate the numbers and types of jobs that will be lost as well as those that are more in demand in the post-lockdown, pre-vaccine economy. This must be followed quickly by retraining and support to shift people into those new jobs.This will not be easy, particularly because the geographical impact of job losses will be highly concentrated. A study last month by the Royal Society of Arts found that in parts of the UK reliant on tourism such as Cornwall and parts of the Yorkshire Dales, including the chancellor’s own constituency, up to a third of jobs are at risk. That’s much higher than in London, Cambridge, Oxford and a number of other affluent areas. We already have some idea of the skills in extra demand. The government says it’s recruited 17,000 people to help track and trace infections. It may need many more. Workplaces will need more people properly trained in, and responsible for, health and safety. If more of our lives are online we need more IT technicians. We will likely need more delivery drivers and cleaners. Job vacancy numbers also out today show that there has been an increase in health and social care positions (just about every other area saw a big drop-off). This presents a problem for the government because healthcare workers take years to train.It is imperative that we start training now where possible, using the online tools many of us have become more used to using during lockdown. Companies must play a role in delivering this too but the recovery depends to an overwhelming degree on government policy and coordination. The state is going to have to become active in the labour market in a way that has not been seen for decades.Voices from many corners have also called for a stimulus package that would put people to work as part of large-scale investment in green infrastructure to achieve the UK’s net-zero emissions target.The furlough scheme has been a relatively blunt, but very effective, weapon in the Treasury’s arsenal. The next stage will have to be more nuanced, more targeted and therefore much more difficult to get right.Rishi Sunak has demonstrated that he understands this problem. The chancellor’s recent changes to the furlough scheme made it more flexible and will allow people to gradually go back to work and increase their hours by the end of October.Unemployment is almost certain to rise as the furlough scheme is tapered down and employers address the reality that they can no longer afford some of their staff.To ensure this process causes as little pain to as few people as possible, the government, alongside businesses, needs to start now to help them into new employment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite this, claimant unemployment rose above 2 million in April, the highest level since 1996, and it is very likely that we will see falls in pay in the months ahead.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s an approach Theroux has largely maintained throughout his career his unique brand of bumbling, placid interviewing has won him numerous Baftas and international fame.Some of his films are impossibly moving. Others are so ludicrously funny they’ve spawned countless memes and a Twitter account called No Context Louis Theroux.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo mark Theroux\u0027s 50th birthday, here are seven of his most brilliant documentaries…The Most Hated Family in America (2007)This lid-lifting documentary introduces viewers to the Kansas family at the core of the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members believe the US government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality.Tiger King: Louis Theroux says he ‘liked’ Joe ExoticLouis Theroux launches first podcast series from coronavirus lockdownBBC defends Louis Theroux documentary from damning claimsThe hugely controversial Christian ministry is notorious for picketing at military funerals with homophobic placards, claiming that soldiers were killed because God hates gay people.It’s an extremely uncomfortable watch, like much of Theroux’s best work, and a topic that has been revisited twice by the filmmaker in 2011’s America’s Most Hated Family in Crisis and 2019’s Surviving America’s Most Hated Family.This is one of Theroux’s most heart-rending documentaries, in which he interviews dementia sufferers and their loved ones. In it, we meet a 49-year-old mother who is unable to grasp the seriousness of her own deterioration, and whose husband is anxious about raising their young daughter alone.There are moments of lightness, too, with a mischievous 89-year-old called Nancy teasing and flirting with Theroux in some of her more lucid moments.It doesn’t have the shock factor of some of his most famous films, but it’s a poignant insight into how love can endure such a devastating condition.This film sees Theroux head off to Portland, Oregon, to investigate polyamory. It is 60 minutes of perfect awkwardness.Three groups of people of varying willingness to be in open relationships are interviewed, and at one point Theroux strips off and attends a naked “sensual eating workshop”.Drinking to Oblivion (2016)In this staggeringly moving watch, Theroux embeds himself at King’s College Hospital in south London, where he interviews patients whose alcoholism is so severe that it has put them at death’s door.Joe, who is on his third day of detox, is one of the most memorable addicts featured. When we meet him, he’s spent the last few months drinking a bottle or two of vodka a day and is in withdrawal, petrified and hardly able to stand.From 32-year-old Joe to a woman who’s been on eight cans of cider a day for the past three decades, the subjects are very varied in an astonishing film that gives a face to an addiction suffered by half a million people in England.A Place for Paedophiles (2009)Theroux gains incredible access in this unsettling film shot in California’s Coalinga Mental Hospital. More than 500 convicted paedophiles are housed in the institution, many of whom have already served prison sentences but are deemed too dangerous for release.One of the sex offenders there has undergone castration in an attempt to secure his release, while another confessed to molesting 50 children.At the time, Theroux said Coalinga was “the weirdest place” he had “ever been to”, which, coming from a man who has spent time with Nazis, Scientologists and Tiger King’s Joe Exotic, is quite a statement.Louis and the Nazis (2003)This is one of Theroux’s most famous documentaries. It sees the filmmaker travel to California to spend time with the White Aryan Resistance, a group that includes 11-year-old twin sisters who have been taught to sing racist pop songs by their mother. It’s one of the rare films that shows Theroux almost lose his temper. When he comes face to face with the people who are perpetuating so much hatred, he doesn’t look shy or confused as he often does, instead he is genuinely raging.In this left-field festive special, Theroux brings together four of the characters he met during his Weird Weekends series to pull crackers with him in his Brooklyn apartment. From a man who claims to channel messages from the alien planet Koldas to another who spent 28 years living in a hole in Idaho, it’s an eclectic mix of guests. The show will put any chaotic Christmas dinners you’ve had into perspective.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information is vital because the presence of mud suggests that water once existed on Mars, which meant that the planet at one point likely had a stable environment, an atmosphere, and a magnetic field that would allow liquid to form on the planet.Creatures found deep beneath the sea give hope for life on Mars“If these features are indeed results of sedimentary volcanism, this is saying to us that in these areas somewhere in the subsurface has to be a source of mud. In other words, there has to be, or had to be, some sort of aquifer containing liquid water to mobilise the fine-grained sediments and take them to the surface of Mars,” said Petr Brož, a scientist at the Institute of Geophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, to CNN. Brož published the scientific work alongside Ondřej Krýza, Lionel Wilson, Susan J. Conway, Ernst Hauber, Adriano Mazzini, Jan Raack, Matthew R. Balme, Matthew E. Sylvest and Manish R. Patel.The researcher also believes that this kind of mud could be present on other bodies in our solar system, such as the dwarf planet Ceres, because of its mountains and bright deposits in its Occator crater which could be caused by water, rocks, and salt that have reached the surface. As such, there may be water beneath the planet’s cold skin.It is possible the same conditions are true for Jupiter\u0027s moon Europa, Saturn\u0027s moon Enceladus or Uranus\u0027 moon Triton. Ceres inhabits a space between Mars and Jupiter in the asteroid belt.Created with Sketch.Beautiful panorama is final photo from Mars opportunity rover Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The left section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthA panorama picture of the surface of Mars, the last photograph taken by Mars\u0027 Opportunity RoverThe middle section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthThe right section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthAnnotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresLeft section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresMiddle section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresRight section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresThe left section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthA panorama picture of the surface of Mars, the last photograph taken by Mars\u0027 Opportunity RoverThe middle section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthThe right section of a panorama photograph taken by NASA\u0027s Mars Opportunity Rover, the final picture taken before losing contact with earthAnnotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresLeft section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresMiddle section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresRight section of the annotated panorama explains the various landscape featuresHowever, this new information does not mean that exploration of Mars’ surface will be easier – at least not by satellite. “Mud flows can look quite similar as magmatic lava flows on Mars... so in principle we are complicating the future exploration of Mars via satellite images, as we are proposing that two very different mechanisms caused similarly looking features, which will be hard to distinguish from each other,” Brož said.It is estimated these mud flows could be between a few hundred of million years old to two billion years old. The earliest concrete evidence of life on Earth, for context, dates at least approximately 3.5 billion years ago.While human missions to Mars are still not possible, the researchers managed to simulate the conditions of the planet on Earth. Simulating conditions of Mars, such as a low atmospheric pressure and temperatures as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) they found that mud did not freeze immediately but rather produced a skin – which would then break as more mud spilled from cracks and froze again.Scientists want to catch interstellar objects with ring of satellitesSalad could be grown on Mars, scientists sayNasa\u0027s Perseverance rover is carrying a hidden message to MarsNot mentioned in the publication, were other experiments where the flows were repeated under a hot Martian environment the planet can reach 20 degrees Celsius for short periods of time. Mud under those conditions “was jumping over the surface as if levitating,” said Brož.This is not the only groundbreaking research about the Red Planet that was recently announced. Researchers at the University of Tokyo managed to simulated the interior of Mars for the first time, giving more information about how Mars was formed 4.6 billion years ago.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means the unemployment rate could continue to climb if businesses do not retain the millions of workers placed on furlough during the lockdown.“While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show Covid-19 is having a major impact on the labour market,” said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In March employment held up well, as furloughed workers still count as employed... Through April, though, there were signs of falling employment as real-time tax data show the number of employees on companies’ payrolls fell noticeably.”So how much would unemployment need to rise in the UK before the impact of the coronavirus begins to compare to other economic crises over the past 100 years?The latest figure of 3.9 per cent remains a long way off unemployment levels following the 2008 financial crisis, when it reached above 8 per cent.And in the 1930s, UK unemployment rose above 20 per cent during the Great Depression – more than five-times higher than current levels.The latest data from the US revealed the biggest surge in unemployment since that period, when it reached a staggering 24.9 per cent in 1933. The US job losses – unemployment currently sits at 14.7 per cent – reflect a severe economic slowdown brought about by businesses shutting down throughout the country as part of containment measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. US figures are expected to remain high, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the rate will be 9.5 per cent by the end of 2021 – nearly three-times higher than pre-coronavirus levels.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

NASA released the image alongside one of the same star, taken from the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert to compare an image from space with one from the earth.The difference in resolution was plain to see, but it still appeared unfocussed. The press and the public were underwhelmed. They had been promised a full colour panorama of galaxies showing the workings of the universe. The telescope had cost $2.5bn and was only providing marginally better pictures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEngineers explained that this was part of the calibration process, known as a first light test, to ensure that the optical systems worked. As they calibrated the telescope the quality of the images would improve.Nasa makes landmark announcement about plan to return to the moonHubble Space Telescope breaks in middle of US government shutdownHubble Space Telescope in serious trouble, Nasa saysHubble discovers signs of water on Earth-sized planetsBehind the 2.4m (7.9 feet) wide primary mirror of the telescope’s optical system were 24 pressure pads to make adjustments and correct for any launch damage. However, no matter what the engineers did, nothing appeared to work, and the promised resolution proved elusive.Slowly, after a month of trying, NASA admitted defeat and confirmed that the mirror had a manufacturing flaw and could not be adjusted remotely to compensate for the error. It was not until December 1993, three and a half years later, that the crew of the space shuttle Columbia were able to transport new optical parts to correct the flaw, giving the telescope super sharp resolution and the ability to beam back awe-inspiring photos.As replacing the mirror in orbit was close to impossible, a new optical component, the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) system, was added that effectively acted as corrective spectacles.Four other servicing missions and upgrades were carried out from 1997 onwards, and COSTAR was removed and returned to earth in 2009 once all the original instruments had been replaced with their own corrections built-in. The telescope may now keep functioning until 2030 or 2040, but nevertheless, its successor, the James Webb Telescope, is scheduled for launch in March 2021.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s no truth to that”.“I needed a break. My father just passed. And I retired. And I retired with the notion that I wasn’t going to come back,” said Mr Jordan.His father, James Jordan, was murdered in 1993 after two 18-year-old men shot him and robbed him whilst he napped in his car on the side of the road, authorities determined at the time.In an earlier episode of ‘The Last Dance’, the NBA star had described how his father was also his friend. We were very close, said the 57-year-old during the seventh episode of the show, in which family members and friends commented on the impact of the death on the star’s career.

I hadn\u0027t played competitive in a long time, said the former NBA player on Sunday’s episode. I felt naked because my father just wasn’t there.

West Bengal is evacuating 200,000, and the neighbouring state of Odisha said it had moved 100,000 people to shelters.Videos posted on social media showed heavy rainfall along the coast and trees whipping back in the wind. Earlier posts showed people carrying belongings - and wearing face masks to protect themselves from Covid-19 - heading to storm shelters.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Between them, India and Bangladesh have more than 130,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, and there are concerns that the storm will put additional strain on medical and emergency services and potentially boost the virus\u0027s spread.Dr Saleemul Haq from the Independent University of Bangladesh said that while Bangladesh has a strong network of cyclone warning systems and shelters, it will be almost impossible for the evacuated population to practise social distancing in such conditions.Charities are particularly concerned for the fate of the sprawling, densely populated Rohingya refugee camps at Cox\u0027s Bazar in Bangladesh, the largest camp of its kind in the world housing almost a million refugees.Cyclone Amphan is a crisis on top of a crisis, said Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India\u0027s humanitarian response director. Many of the cyclone evacuation shelters are already being used as coronavirus quarantine centres or housing migrants who have returned to their coastal communities because of lockdown. People are worried there won’t be enough space in the shelters and that they might catch coronavirus in them.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Simon Wang, Professor of Climate, Utah State University, said we don\u0027t yet know whether last year\u0027s record storm activity in the Bay of Bengal was an outlier year or a year that portends things to come.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to Australian news website News.au, a post on a popular local anti-coronavirus Facebook group includes a photo of a design on the note with the caption: “The new $10 Australian note complete with coronavirus symbols. You can’t make this up! #areyouawakeyet.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Reportedly, the group, which has organised small protests in Sydney and Melbourne, believe the pandemic is an orchestrated effort by billionaires and governments to force vaccinations on the general population.Supporters of the group have reportedly pointed to a bogus video titled “Plandemic” which purports to provide evidence for a host of conspiracy theories loosely tied to the Covid-19 outbreak. These include a claim from Judy Mikovits, an anti-vaccine activist, who states that wearing masks somehow activates the disease within people. She doesn’t provide any evidence for this spurious assertion and criticises orders to stay away from beaches. The entire video has been debunked. The movement has also incorporated other baseless beliefs, including that 5G mobile antennas are dangerous to human health and are somehow related to coronavirus. All this has also been debunked. The design on the bank note features three spiky circular shapes, which could be said to look a bit like highly magnified viruses.There is, however, a simpler explanation: the design represents the round spiky shape of bramble wattle flowers. The plant, a type of acacia, is native to Australia. Its close relative, the golden wattle, was made the official floral emblem of the country in 1988.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

have a second home in Tuscany and haven’t yet booked your usual budget flight for the we, kids and nanny, isn’t a big deal.But for the majority of people, this wishy-washy stance is plunging them into a maelstrom of confusion over what to do about the family holiday they booked when coronavirus was still but a glint in China’s eye.You can go to France but will have to quarantine for two weeks when you , unless you’re a lorry driver.You might be able to go to Greece without penalty, but they’re not sure about Spain which might get a second wave of Covid.So chances are,you’ve booked a week in Benidorm, you might have to self-isolate for two weeks when youto the UK — on top of the  squillion weeks you’ve already done in lockdown.And you can’t go to Croatia unless there’s an R in the month.OK, I made the last bit up.But to be honest, it could easily be part of the currently nonsensical government “guidance” on travel during the traditional summer holiday season.Given the death toll from Covid-, everyone unaffected knows they’re lucky to even be alive.So it’s not the “First-World problem” of having to cancel a holiday that’s the issue.It’s the potential loss of big money — on top of what they’ve already lost during lockdown — that’s worrying people.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s declaration that summer holidays are “very unlikely” doesn’t help one bit when it comes to navigating the legal small print involving cancellations. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg stripallw\"

you either have to go ahead with the trip and face the prospect of having to self-isolate for two weeks onto the UKOR you have to cancel it and lose all the money you’ve paid so far.Whereasthe British Government ruled that only essential travel was allowed until, say, September October, it would give clarity to all the people trapped in this new version of holiday hell and legally entitle them to a

could rule that holidays on the continent are allowed and you only have to self-isolate on you show symptoms of the virus.But this “wait and see” middle ground is helping no one.Thank God for that.My

learning from their academically minded parents, feel free to keep them at homeyou’re worried about them getting Covid-.But for those kids who live in worrying, unstable circumstances, being at school brings some much-needed stability and a chance for teachers to keep an eye on their mental and physical health.It also boosts their chances of trying to keep up educationally with all those aforementioned peers who, thanks to their better circumstances, will race ahead even more academically.Factor in that, statistically, the chances of children getting seriously ill from Covid are minuscule and that, until a vaccine is found, there will never be a guarantee of not getting the virus, and it all adds up to one logical conclusion.Schools re-opening isn’t just for those who want to

This is about ‘safe’ being an acceptable level of risk.”Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of SAGE, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools re-opened.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.They were backed last week by the British Medical Association, who said unions were absolutely right to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on June .BMA councils chair, Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA councils chair, said at the time: We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union , refused to back down on Tuesday, saying: “Our current assessment is that schools aren’t safe to open, as our five tests have not been met.Butour five tests are met, then on a national level, it would be permissible to go ahead with reopening schools.”According to the Daily Mail, its leaders were caught making a series of slurs in a Zoom meeting last night.The video footage exposed the joint general secretary Mary Bousted accusing children of being mucky by spreading germs and wiping their snot on peoples clothes.The hard-line leaders also discussed how to threaten headteachers should they try to get their staff back to work.The NEU’s five tests include lowering the number of virus cases, plans for social distancing, more testing, strategies for entire schools and protection for the vulnerable.The reopening of primary schools could be delayed beyond June  as local authorities yesterday advised their schools to stay closed, including the first Tory-run council.The Government made clear today that every school’s circumstances were dferent and thata head teacher felt unable to open next month, they should “discuss options” with their local authority or trust. It comes as France makes a mockery of British demands, with teachers ing to French schools wearing masks and taking simple extra precautions.They are among  European to countries which have re-opened classrooms - and evidence suggests that doing so has not been harmful to kids or teachers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

George Eustice told Parliament he wanted pubs to tentatively start gradually opening hopefully during the month of July. The Environment Secretary warned the move would have to be supported by scientic advice on the spread of the virus. But he added he believed pubs could reopen normally... hopefully later this summer. Mr Eusticeaposs comments raise the prospect of an earlier opening date than government sources have described. The governmentaposs roadmap to ease lockdown - which applies to England - says hospitality venues could start to reopen from July  at the earliest. But government sources have repeatedly stressed this might mean cafes or restaurants with outdoor seating areas at first - not pubs. Sources had indicated pubs would not be in the first wave and would only come in later phases, after July - with not even beer gardens allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, scientists have warned some social distancing rules may have to remain until thereaposs a vaccine, making much of pub le impossible. Despite this, Mr Eustice emphasised pubs when he spoke to MPs today in the Commons.  Asked about pubs, he said: As the Prime Minister has outlined, we intend that the hospitality sector - including pubs - would be able to tentatively start gradually opening hopefully during the month of July - subject to the epidemiology supporting such a move. And of course we are already working with the hospitality and pub sector to identy what social distancing measures they might be able to put in place to make that work properly. Mr Eustice said pubs are at the heart of our community and many are facing dficulty - despite being able to operate as take-aways. He told MPs: We recognise that until thingsto something closer to normal and they can reopen normally, hopefully later this summer, then it will not give them all of the trade they previously had.  Downing Street did not confirm or deny that pubs could start reopening as early as July. Asked about Mr Eusticeaposs comments, Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: I think that’s a reflection of the detail in the roadmap. That obviously is with the signicant caveat that it has to be safe to do so. Askedplaces reopening would be not just cafes, but pubs as well, he said: The roadmap just talks about hospitality and that would cover pubs.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dishwashers padlocks cheaper after brexit","story":"NewsDishwashers and padlocks to be cheaper after Brexit - but tarfs on cars and lamb remainA string of imported household goods and foods are set to be cheaper under a post-Brexit tarf regime - but others will keep tarfs in place, andtheres no deal with the EU, those tarfs could be slapped on goods from the continent tooShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPadlocks will be among a string of goods that are made tarf-free \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Department for International Trade said the new system, called the UK Global Tarf, will see duties axed on around £billion worth of imports. It came as the UK Government tried to pile pressure on the EU over the future relationship between Britain and Brussels by publishing  draft agreements covering areas such as trade, aviation and criminal justice.As Britain prepares to leave the Brexit transition on December , ministers unveiled the list of tarfs which will be axed or maintained when EU rules cease to apply.Duties will remain to protected industries such as agriculture, car-making and fishing. But items such as dishwashers, freezers, Christmas trees, tampons, scissors and padlocks will see zero tarfs under the regime, while the Government said cooking products such as cocoa and baking powder will also be levy free.

A % tarf on imported cars, as well as duties on agricultural products such as lamb, beef, and poultry, will stay to protect British industry.

The animal was pursued across a field by a pack of dogs as mounted riders were nearby. Campaigners released the video, which was filmed in November, after police and prosecutors decided against taking action against the hunt involved. The shocking film, which lasts one minute,  seconds, shows two riders and about a dozen dogs near a hedge on the edge of a field.  After about a minute, the hounds break off and begin barking as they run down the field. Eventually a fox can be seen running away towards a tree, while a horn can be heard in the background. Sheep in a neighbouring field can be seen running away, and the dogs skirt the edge of the first field along the hedgerow before the footage breaks off. The incident, which unfolded near Okeford Fitzpaine, Dorset and appeared to involve the Portman Hunt, was filmed by Wildle Witness and reported to police. A Wildle Witness spokesman said: “It is sickening to watch this happening  years after hunting was banned. “The legislation needs tightening to prevent foxes being subjected to such terror.  “We will continue to monitor the activities of hunts and bring in to the public domain the reality of what is happening in our countryside.” Hunting with hounds was banned on February ,  following the  Hunting Act’s approval by Parliament. But trail hunting, where where riders accompanied by hounds follow a scent along a pre-determined route, is allowed. It is meant to replicate a traditional hunt but without a fox being chased, maimed or killed. Dorset Police confirmed it received a report “in relation to an alleged illegal fox hunt that had been witnessed in the area of Okeford Fitzpaine near Blandford”.  A force spokesman said a “local officer carried out an investigation into the incident and two men attended for voluntary interviews with officers”. The spokesman added: “Evidence was compiled and following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, a decision was made not to bring any charges in relation to the case. “Dorset Police will investigate any alleged breached of the Hunting Act  and other legislation and will work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to determinea case could be taken to court. “Hunting mammals with dogs has been illegal since .  “A few, very specic, exemptions apply. “We would urge anyone with clear evidence of such offending to please report it to us.” A spokesman for the Portman Hunt said: “The Portman Hunt operates within the law by carrying out lawful trail hunting activities. “As has been proven on numerous occasions in court, the evidence provided by anti-hunting activists almost always fails to support their claims of illegal hunting activity. “This has been proven yet again by the authorities investigating this case who have said there will be no further action. “Anti-hunting activists are aware that the circulation of their edited footage online using social media s can amply their highly emotive messages, regardless of the facts, but this often results in hundreds of hours of wasted police time, which is totally unacceptable.” League Against Cruel Sports campaigns director Chris Luffingham said: “If ‘trail’ hunting is real then in no circumstances should animals be chased by hounds, it simply wouldn’t happen.

Torsten Bell, chief executive of living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation said it showed “Britain’s jobs crisis has now arrived”. Calling for more support for young people he urged the Government to “repair our social security safety net” to protect those facing financial ruin.

We are likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen.” The Institute for Employment Studies said many of the areas worst hit by the rise in unemployment were in the North West of England. In Blackpool, % are now “claimant unemployed”, up from % in March. Elsewhere, one in  residents are claimant unemployed in Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Thanet, Kent. In another sign of the bleak employment landscape, there was a record fall in job vacancies, down , to , in the three months to April. There are also fears over the effect that increased unemployment will have on the nation’s health.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said a % rise could lead to a further one million people developing chronic health conditions. Unemployment was already on the rise, climbing by ,, to . mil­­lion in the three months to March. The number of paid employees plunged by , at the start of April to . million but this excluded eight million currently furloughed. Calling for more support for young people Mr Bell also warned against a sharp clf-edge end to furlough.

The gt of le is precious and delays are agonising for all those on the register who are in dire need of a kidney, heart or liver.

Haven, Center Parcs and Butlin’s are drawing up plans to adapt their sites to cater for families’ “pent-up demand to get away” while sticking to vital social distancing rules.They are hoping the Government clears holiday parks and resorts to reopen in July – under what would be Phase Three of Boris Johnson ’s plan to ease us out of lockdown and reboot the hospitality sector.It comes after Visit Britain said the domestic market, worth £billion, has already lost £billion as a result of Covid- measures. The group wants families to make  the “year of domestic tourism”. Acting chief executive Patricia Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee: “To get British tourism up and running this summer – and the summer is hugely important – you’re going to need that domestic audience.” She added there was “a real job to be done” to convince people it is acceptable to “enjoy a holiday and that it’s safe to do so”. But figures from coolcamping. com, covering  locations, show summer bookings for campsites have soared % in the past week. The website said: “There’s clearly a pent-up demand to get away. The mooted date of July  is ideal timing for summer and could save many businesses who have had no income.” Rethinks on how resorts and parks operate will help reassure people mulling a staycation. Haven says planned measures range from Perspex screens at reception and info desks to check-ins from home. On-site grocery stores will have the same social distancing rules as supermarkets, while restaurants will just do takeaways and deliveries. Hand- washing stations will be dotted around all  parks and there will be reduced numbers on sites – with communal areas like swimming pools will staying closed.Haven said: “Our prices have been adjusted to recognise the revised experience. We’ve made signicant changes, which we anticipate will allow us to open as soon as Government deems it safe. We’ll comply with coronavirus restrictions.”Center Parcs, which has six UK sites, is also hoping to reopen in July and said holidaymakers could expect to see “some changes”. A spokesman said: “We are reviewing the whole experience to ensure we can open with appropriate social distancing as well as any other measures required to keep our staff and guests safe. “We know we can adapt and provide reassurance to guests and staff, and will only reopen when the time is right. When we do, we are confident we will provide a great guest experience for families.” Butlin’s said fewer people would be allowed in entertainment venues and it would increase the number of shows. There will be more sittings for meals as well as extra events so that kids do not miss out on activities. The firm said: “We are awaiting guidance as to when we can reopen. “In the meantime, we’re using all of the skills and creativity of our team to plan a break that keeps everyone safe.” The Camping and Caravanning Club, which represents , sites, said caravanners will park six metres apart and tents will also be pitched with large gaps between them. Its plans include asking campers and caravan owners to bring their own portable loos so toilets can stay closed. Bosses offered to do a trial reopening after losing £million of bookings due to Covid-. Camping and Caravanning Club director general Sabina Voysey said: “We’re well-placed to offer socially-distanced holidays and eager to work on trial schemes for how campsites may reopen with all necessary measures. “We urge the Government to provide greater clarity on how the sector can safely open and operate.” The plans to get staycations firmly on the radar emerged as airlines slammed a bid by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to boost uptake of foreign holidays as unworkable. Mr Shapps raised hopes of travel to top hotspots by striking up no-quarantine deals, or “air bridges”, with countries where infection rates are low. Britain’s biggest tour operator, Tui, said it hopes to kick-start the season from June . The firm got a boost after Portugal and Greece revealed they were willing to relax quarantine restrictions for Britsit was a two-way system. Algarve Tourism Board head Joao Fernandes said: “If British holidaymakers are allowed to fly to countries with low infection rates via ‘air bridges’, without having the need for quarantine, the Algarve will be the place to be.” But airlines said the scheme was at odds with the Government’s two- week quarantine rules for anyone coming into the UK, effective from next month, and a Foreign Office ban on non-essential travel abroad. The PM’s official spokesman said air bridges were “an option under consideration but not agreed policy”.

But the couple havenapost released anything this year, and itaposs unlikely that they will, as theyaposve now stepped out of the spotlight. Instead, they spent the day privately in their new LA home with son Archie.Just like everyone , the Sussex family are in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic - which means they didnapost really have much of a choice. But according to Harperaposs Baazer, theyaposve still made it special and both Meghan and Harry took the day off from work and charities duties.A source close to the couple told the magazine: Like everyone , they are in lockdown at the moment, so they will just be hanging out together at home, but it will still be a lovely day. Theyaposre not going to be doing any work and made sure they have no meetings or calls in the diary.  The day will simply be quality time with one another and as a family.The couple have been forced to stop using their Sussex Royal Instagram account after the Queen banned them from using the word aposroyalapos in their branding, which means they wouldnapost have been able to share a photo that way eventhey wanted to.Meghan and Harry tied the knot at St Georgeaposs Chapel, which is in Windsor Castle, on May , .  They had a star-studded guestlist including George and Amal Clooney, Serena Williams, Idris Elba, James Corden and Oprah Winfrey. The Royal Family were also out in force, with the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Charles and Camilla all watching up. After the ceremony the couple took a carriage ride around Windsor before heading back to Frogmore House for two private receptions. They invited just their aposinner circleapos to the private evening celebrations, which was filled with dancing, booze and personalised touches. But everyone who got one of those very special invitations had to follow a lot of very, very strict rules, which allowed the couple to ensure their celebrations were completely private.

He still cycles to restaurants and takeaways, picks up the food then rides to the customeraposs house to drop it off. But the reason behind many of his orders is now dramatically dferent, and heaposs no longer just delivering a lazy dinner but providing an essential service to the most vulnerable people in our community. Since lockdown was brought in, the delivery company has started working with convenience shops to take groceries to people who are self-isolating or shielding.  Robin, , has been a driver with the delivery company for four years, but admits he did consider quitting when the lockdown was introduced. He told : There were a couple of days when I felt like I really didnapost want to go out, but then as time passed I realised that I should. I was more concerned at the start, it was just a complete shock. It was a shock for everybody. People are so grateful for us to bringing their stuff to them. Itaposs a great feeling, it feels like youaposre contributing to keeping people safe. People used to order for a treat but now theyaposre ordering because they really need stuff and they donapost want to leave their house.  One moment that sticks in his mind is when a customer left him a thank you note and a chocolate bar to thank him for dropping groceries off to her. The note said: Hereaposs a wee treat to get you through the rest of your sht. Robin, who has been a Deliveroo driver for four years and lives with his girlfriend, who is also a key worker, said: Iaposve never been tipped in chocolate before. It was so nice and I really wasnapost expecting it. Itaposs good knowing youaposre helping people.  Robin does everything he can to protect himself and customers while out delivering, like all his Deliveroo colleagues. He uses hand sanitiser before entering and once heaposs left each restaurant, and does the same as he arrives at the customeraposs house. While there have been a lot more orders, the quieter roads have made the actual delivering part of the job much easier. Robin said: Weaposre not seeing as much of the customers, itaposs down from about  per cent to about  per cent. Weaposre leaving the food on the doorstep. But thereaposs still a little bit of contact from a distance. His fellow driver Alex Smith, , delivers in Horsham alongside his university studies.  He knew he wanted to carry on working as soon as he saw how grateful people were, and heaposs made a mini documentary about his time out delivering. He said: I was determined to carry on. I did it for a little bit, and then I saw how important it was to vulnerable people. Being able to help someone is really nice. There are vulnerable people who canapost get food, and being able to deliver to them is important. People are saying thank you for working, it just made me think that someone has got to do it and I want to be the one to do it.  What I like most is how grateful people are. People are really nice when youaposre dropping off.

While weaposre sure she didnapost mind, this was the situation Meghan Markle was in as she married Prince Harry at St Georgeaposs Chapel two years ago today - something her future sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge would have been very aware of. So, when planning her outfit for the special day Kate made a very thoughtful decision. In order not to steal any of the limelight and ensure all the fashion focus was on Meghan, Kate opted to rewear an old outfit for the day. She wore her Alexanda McQueen tailored coat, and it was the fourth time weaposve seen her in it. Most famously, she wore it to Princess Charlotteaposs christening in July .Rewearing an old outfit means fashion fans and the media canapost get too excited about what sheaposs wearing as theyaposve already seen and analysed it before. And this isnapost the first time Kate has done this, and she actually rarely wears a new outfit to a wedding, always recycling an old dress or coat.

The -year-old heart swap boy spoke as experts revealed the coronavirus crisis has led to a slump in transplants. It comes as Max and Keira’s Law on opt-out donation is rolled out across England on Wednesday – after a four-year campaign by the Mirror. Max said: “I would say to people today… don’t waste your organs when you die.” Ethan,  months, has been waiting in hospital for a heart since August to replace his enlarged one. The brave -year-old urged more people to consider becoming donors – on the eve of the opt-out rule bearing his name and that of the little girl who saved his le being adopted in England.  As doctors prepare to start ramping them up again, Max pleaded: “If you can save lives when you die, why wouldn’t you ” One of those lives is -month-old Ethan, who has been waiting for a heart since August to replace his enlarged one. The tot is hooked up to an articial heart as mum Roseleila and dad Richard look on helplessly. Max and Keira’s Law, which came after a four-year campaign by the Mirror for an opt-out rule, does not apply to under s and parents still have to give permission for doctors to use their children’s organs. But Roseleila and Richard could face an even longer wait due to the ­coronavirus pandemic.  Some patients have had to be taken off the transplant list because the risk to them of receiving an organ is too high. No one who dies showing Covid- symptoms can donate. Those who are able to be treated, such as kidney patients on dialysis, may be expected to wait longer for operations. But those in dire need of transplants, who would die without an organ, will still have surgery. Max was given his heart by the family of nine-year-old Keira Ball, who died in a car accident near her home at ­Barnstaple, Devon, in . She also saved three others. His parents Paul, , and Emma, , and Keira’s mum Loanna and dad Joe are working hard to raise awareness of the new law – which was inspired by their children. Loanna, , who was seriously injured in the crash that killed her daughter, said: “Max and Keira will be remembered long after we are gone. “This law is so important. They really will go down in history, they will never be forgotten. That means so much.” The couple’s charity, Inspired by Keira, is helping bereaved parents cope with the loss of a child. And they worked tirelessly to help the , currently on the organ donor list. Loanna and Joe also work hard to reassure parents who might consider organ donationthe ­unthinkable were to happen, and they were to lose a child. Paul and Emma, of Winsford, Cheshire, wrote a book called Golden Heart, in which they vividly describe the ordeal of parents whose children are on the transplant list. For Max, it was nine months on a ward at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital looking out of the window, wonderingand when he might be saved.  Even at , he was thinking of others, admitting he might not make it. But he still believed the new law was right. For five-year-old Frankie Lord, who was in the Freeman at the same time as Max and featured in the Mirror on Tuesday, it was a -month wait for his parents Sophie and Chris as they watched the agony of their little boy clinging to le. Emma said: “What I say to people is how would you feel about organ ­donationyour child needed an organ  “If one of your loved ones needed a transplant, would you accept a donor organ  I think that is the best way of looking at it…you would take one, you should be prepared to give.”  Civil servant Paul added: “Max has never forgotten the children on the ward who did not make it. “He remembered them when we decided to join the Mirror campaign almost exactly three years ago. And he still remembers them now.” Max, who has a -year-old brother, Harry, has formed an unbreakable bond with Loanna and Joe and their ­children Bradley, , Katelyn, , and -year-old Keely – who he calls his “second family”. Both the Johnsons and Balls paid tribute to Mirror readers, who backed our campaign to reform the organ law – which now assumes everyone is a donor unless they opt out.  Experts believe it will give surgeons  more organs to ­transplant ­annually, saving hundreds of lives each year. Thousands signed up to join the organ donor register, and petition Parliament for change. It was backed by footballer Andy Cole – who received a kidney from his nephew Alexander Palmer – surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub, The British Heart Foundation, Kidney Care UK, the British Medical Association and Kaylee Davidson-Olley, the first successful and longest surviving baby transplant in Europe after receiving her heart at just five months old. NHS Blood and Transplant had a huge rise in the number of donors signing up. Its medical director for organ ­donation, John Forsythe, said: “As the situation with Covid- is ever changing, so is the picture regarding donation and transplantation. “Some units have made the dficult decision to close their transplant programmes for now. This to support the NHS in treating Covid- patients.  “Lesaving transplants are still going ahead as long as clinical staff feel it is safe. Transplant teams will talk to patients and balance their need against the additional challenges of being immunosuppressed at this time and the challenges being faced within the NHS at this moment.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Coronavirus has vividly reminded us that le is a precious gt, one that we must do all we can to treasure and protect. “It’s why the new organ donor opt-out law, which comes into force today, is so important.” How Mirror helped bring in donor law April  Teddy Houlston became Britain’s youngest donor, donating his organs after dying aged just  minutes. It led to more than , people signing the organ donor register.  December  The soft opt-out system comes into force in Wales after a  law change. The Daily Mirror launches its Change the Law for Le campaign calling for legislation change in England too.  July  Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson came up in the Private Members’ Ballot and chose to use it to change the law to presumed consent in England.

February  The bill finally becomes law after passing its final hurdle in the House of Lords. A huge public information campaign begins to let people know thatthey do not opt out, it is assumed that they consent to donate. May  The law comes in to force. Transplants up after Covid- shutdown By Health Editor Martin Bagot Lesaving transplants are being ramped up again as Max and Keira’s Law comes in to force on Wednesday. Most operations had been delayed due to fears vulnerable patients might contract Covid- during surgery. And health minister Lord Bethell has said that while NHS bosses had no choice but to impose the policy many organs had been “wasted” as a result. Care minister Helen Whately told the Commons yesterday “over , people in England are waiting for a transplant”. She said: “During the peak of the pandemic, there were many days that there were no transplants. “As of last week there have been  referrals,  donors and  transplants. “We have a duty now more than ever to push ahead with measures that will reduce human suffering and help people improve their quality of le. “That is exactly what this law does.” The law presumes all adults in England agree to be donors unless they opt out. Anthony Clarkson, of NHS Blood and Transplant, said: “We hope this will prompt all of us to consider whether or not we want to donate our organs.” Fiona Loud, of Kidney Care UK, said it “gives a shining light of hope” to the hundreds needing a kidney transplant. “Capacity and resource must be built back up so that precious organs do not go to waste.”  aposHave that conversation for kids like my Ethanapos By Julie McCaffrey and Grace Macaskill All day and night, Roseleila Eaves has her phone on full charge, the ringtone set to loud and always within easy reach. Becausea call comes to say a donor heart has become available, -month-old son Ethan’s le depends on it. The tot has been in Great Ormond Street Hospital since August last year and is hooked up to an articial heart. All he knows is that the cannulas get in the way of his crawling practice. He is blissfully unaware they are keeping him alive until a tiny heart transplant takes place. His family, who have been warned the coronavirus outbreak means longer waits for transplant ops, are appealing for parents to talk about donation should the worst happen.  Roseleila, , from Luton, says: “I can only imagine how raw and devastating a conversation about organ donation could be when a parent has just lost a child. “But NHS studies have found many parents have said in hindsight they would have agreed. “Many young lives would be savedthose conversations were had now. Talk to each other and talk to your childrenthey’re old enough, so you know their wishes. Today, the day Max and Keira’s Law comes into force, marks  days since Ethan’s been on the urgent transplant list.” Ethan was diagnosed with an enlarged heart in August , seven months after engineer dad Richard, , had a transplant for a dferent heart condition. He was born a healthy lb oz and when sent for a routine heart test because of his family background was given the all clear. But on the couple’s first wedding anniversary on August , Ethan was rushed to hospital after falling ill and an X-ray found his heart was enlarged. In a -hour op, Ethan was wired to a mechanical heart after his own began beating dangerously fast.  “Sadly, it’s not a cure and comes with a risk of blood clots,” says Roseleila. “He desperately needs the transplant. Every night when I leave him in hospital tohome to my husband and two older children, I become emotional and so does Ethan.” Max and Keira’s Law does not apply to under-s and parents still have to give permission for doctors to use their organs. Before the pandemic, children waited an average  days for a transplant – compared with  for adults. More than  kids in the UK need an organ transplant and  of them are waiting for a heart. The size of the heart is important, meaning a donor of a similar size is needed. A young donor is their only hope. But for some, the call never comes. Amelia Brown has been waiting for a new kidney since she was born eight years ago. She has serious renal problems caused by vacterl syndrome. A transplant is her only hope of enjoying simple childhood joys. Mum Gemma, , of Sheffield, says: “Amelia stays positive by saying things like, ‘When I get a new kidney I’ll be able to jump really high’. “She stays cheerful and positive and that helps me and my husband, Jason. The idea of the transplant never happening is unthinkable. “That’s why we urge families to have the conversation about organ donation. People often avoid them because it’s too awful to think about.But for many parents of children on the transplant list, that’s the reality.Follow Ethan’s journey on Instagram at @ethaneaves_ Campaigneraposs perfect birthday gt By Warren Manger Max and Keira’s law is the birthday present Christine Cox has dreamed of for  years.

Clare Milward said she found the matted green mass in the bottom of a carton of Apple, Lime and Mint from Crafted Drinks. The company have said the packaging must have become damaging after leaving the factory. Clare, who is married with two sons aged ten and , said: Iaposm not sureit was related, but all week I felt nauseous and had a funny tummy and could not eat anything other than bland foods.We have been staying home and washing our hands regularly because of coronavirus, andit was food poisoning from something  then the whole family would have had it as we have eaten the same things.We, as a family, have decided not to use cartons again, only see-through bottles.

But I had a sip and thought, aposthis isnapost rightapos. Clare, from Lancing, West Sussex, thought it could be a piece of mint. She says that when she cut the carton open she was horried to find a lump of green mould. The company said the packaging must have become damaged because it carries out stringent checks on products before they go on sale.  Clare said: It was not open or anything, I think air must have got in somehow. I could still see some mould on the inside of the carton and around the plastic where the drink is poured from, so I think it was sitting at the top. I was pretty disgusted by the amount of mould, it was well in date - the carton said it was best before November this year.For that amount of mould to build up, how long has it been festering for  Clare emailed the company, hoping for a robust reaction.  But she was disappointed by Crafted Drinksapos response. She said: I always think you should give the company a chance to reply, so messaged them privately, but they just said sorry and gave me a £ voucher. I said I would like them to respond in a robust way but they did not respond. I have got the mould but they donapost want to test it or anything. A Crafted Drinks spokesman said: We take the quality of our products extremely seriously and follow the highest standards throughout the production process.  Detailed checks are made on all batches and products are held until final quality control checks have been undertaken before they are released for sale. In addition, samples from each batch are retained so that we can review them and carry out further testsever required. This is exactly what we did on this occasion.

Research by Loughborough University sheds light on the shameful crisis, with . million children estimated to be in poverty across the UK. The horrying data found the poverty rate has risen fastest in the North East, and where it now affects nearly a quarter of children. Horried MPs in the region have voiced their anger at the government for failing families in their constituencies. Heaviest hit has been Middlesbrough, where more than four in  children are classed as being below the breadline, even before housing costs are taken into account. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Researchers found .% of kids are affected - a huge increase on the .% in  . Glasgow, Newcastle, Oldham, Bolton, Birmingham and Leeds are among the towns and cities that have seen the steepest rises.Middlesborough MP Andy McDonald told : Sadly I’m not surprised at this report’s findings as this fits with every other measure of deprivation showing Middlesbrough at the wrong end of the table. “Too many families in Middlesbrough are poor because of the impact of failed economic and social policies of Tory Governments since . And he continued: “Austerity has hit places like Middlesbrough hardest. Even the Tories have woken up to the lack of fairness revealed by glaring regional inequalities but its they who have made it increasingly worse ever since they came back into power.And he warned that unless the government properly supports struggling families, it will get a great deal worse. Find out how bad child poverty is in your community by entering your postcode here: Mr McDonald said: It was bad enough before the Covid crisis but the pandemic not only exposes all of that, it will in all likelihood makes things a lot worse. Labour MP Chi Onwurah, who represents Newcastle Central, toldshe is horried, but not surprised at the figures. The analysis shows that the child poverty rate has risen from .% to .% - the third highest increase in Britain. She said: Whataposs horrying is that weaposre the sixth richest nation in the world, and yet this is happening. A signicant proportion of children in poverty have at least one parent in work, so what the last  years of austerity have done is shown that work doesnapost pay anymore.  Ms Onwurah said that the coronavirus pandemic is making the situation even more desperate for struggling families. She said: My casework has gone up hugely since the coronavirus outbreak, there are a lot of people who have lost their jobs, or theyaposre carers for family members and are scared to go out. Weaposve had a huge surge in food bank useage. My concern is that we wonapost now see rises in the jobs that people need, and there wonapost be enough training and support to get them into work.She said many of her constituents have not had a pay rise since , and a five-week wait for Universal Credit is pushing many into poverty. Since  the number of children living in poverty in Britain has risen by , before housing costs are taken into account - meaning one in six children, or %, live in affected homes. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions reveal that . million children were living in poverty in Great Britain in March last year.And the picture is even more bleak after housing costs are taken into account, with the figure rising to . million in the UK under the Tories - , more than a decade ago.North East - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  West Midlands - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  North West - up to % from .% - a .% rise  Yorkshire and Humberside - up to .% from .% - a .% rise  Scotland - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  London - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  South East - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East of England - up to .% from .% - a .% increase  East Midlands - stayed the same, at .%  Wales - down to .% from .% - a .% decrease  South West - down to .% from % - a .% decrease Campaigners warn that unless the government takes steps to ease the burden on families, the coronavirus pandemic will make the situation even worse.The Daily Mirror is running a Give Me Five campaign - calling on Boris Johnson to urgently address the unfolding tragedy across Britain.We initially called for child benefit to be hiked by £ a week - but our charity partners now say the effect of the pandemic is so bad that the government needs to bring in a £ increase instead. The West Midlands saw child poverty levels rise from .% to .%, while the North West went from .% to %. However the proportion stayed the same in the East Midlands, at .%. And it fell slightly in Wales and the South West, the figures show.  Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Childrenaposs Bureau, who chairs the End Child Poverty group, said: We may all be experiencing the storm of Coronavirus together, but we are not all in the same boat. The government’s data shows the extent to which over the past four years, children in low income families have been cut adrt and are already experiencing unacceptable hardship through cuts and freezes to the benefits system. Our country’s children are now at severe risk of being swept deeper into poverty as a result of the pandemic and lockdown. This is why we are asking the government to strengthen the social security system which is there to hold us steady during tough times, by immediately increasing household income for those least well-off. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, the Daily Mirror was calling on Boris Johnson to hike child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK was set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years. Our Give Me Five campaign wanted an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lt , children out of destitution. Our campaign was backed by charities, politicians and union leaders. However, as the global pandemic sparks a fresh recession - which the International Monetary Fund warns could be the worst since the Great Depression in the  - charities say more needs to be done. Action for Children is now calling on the Government to increase child benefit further, by £, to recognise the ever-worsening situation plunging children in poverty. Meanwhile the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is calling for a just emergency intervention, targeted to mitigate the immediate strain on low-income families. The charity says an increase of at least £ per child per week to the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits would go a long way to covering the increased costs posed by the current and potential subsequent lockdowns. Ending child poverty must be at the heart of the Government’s plan for economic recovery, so that when this crisis is over all children can enjoy a le free from poverty in which they are healthy, can thrive at school and have opportunities for the future. Researchers have warned that as housing costs are not taken into account, the scale of the problem in London - where the cost of living is highest - is not emphasised. But the capital features strongly in figures showing the number of children in poverty evenone adult is in work. In Putney, more than % of children in poverty are in working families, while that figure stands at .% in Tooting. More than two in three children are living in poverty in parts of Birmingham, alongside four in five children in parts of Greater Manchester.  And in London, , children were below the breadline in March . The child poverty figure ranges from just % in Elmbridge, Surrey, to % in places like Oldham in Greater Manchester and Pendle in Lancashire.

Her Majestyaposs net worth in  was said to be £million - but extensive repairs to Buckingham Palace are reported to have taken their toll on her funds, OK reports.The -year-old monarch currently ranks at  on the rich list and is estimated to be worth £million as of this year.It comes after reports royal residences will remain closed to tourists during the  coronavirus crisis and members of staff face pay freezes.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    While The Queen herself is set to withdraw from public duties for months in the longest enforced absence ever during her reign.It was last week confirmed Buckingham Palace would remain shut to visitors for the remainder of the year, while those who have booked to explore the Queenaposs London home will be refunded. While the Royal Collection Trust has also ordered Frogmore House in Windsor and the Prince of Walesaposs London base Clarence House to remain closed in .  Garden parties and investitures at the Palace have already been cancelled, Trooping the Colour will not take place in its normal form and the royals have swapped public appearances for video calls as they carry out their duties while working from home. The Trust, which oversees tourism at royal residences, pays a £ million facility fee to the Royal Household for the privilege of bringing in visitors and a big chunk of it, although not all of it, will be lost. That fee bolsters the £. million the Queen currently receives from the taxpayer under the Sovereign Grant, which is equivalent to  per cent of the Crown Estate profits. The Sun reported Lord Chamberlain Earl Peel - the most senior official of the royal household - has warned staff that income is expected to fall by a third this year leaving reported losses of £.m.In an email to staff seen by the newspaper, the Lord Chamberlain said the royal household was not immune to the impact of the pandemic. All but essential expenditure has been suspended, a recruitment freeze has been implemented and the annual pay review has been paused, he reportedly told staff. A Palace spokesman said the time to address this issue can only come when the impact of the crisis is clearer. At the moment the attention of the royal household is on ensuring it follows all the guidelines and supports the national effort in combatting Covid-, he added.However, it was reported last week Her Majesty had instructed a team of builders to resume work on the £ million refurbishment of Buckingham Palace now that the Government has eased lockdown measures. The Queen has been staying at Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh and is expected to remain there for the foreseeable future.

Marked with radium paint to glow in the dark, it helped them evade capture in an -day trek that ended with one of them being rescued wearing just his underpants and beret after crossing the River Somme. Brigadier Peter Vaux, Major Stewart Fernie and Lance Corporal Robert Burroughs had found themselves isolated and surrounded during the Battle of Arras in May . But they bravely dodged German patrols, hid in farms and woodland in northern France and scavenged for food. At one point they were caught by a German officer, who Brig Vaux shot dead at close range. With the aid of the compass, they made it to the River Somme, where they met a Belgian interpreter who gave Brig Vaux some civilian clothes. The men cut a path to the river while taking notes on the whereabouts of the German patrols, but became separated crossing the river at night. On the other side Brig Vaux walked up the river bank clad in just underpants and a beret until, exhausted, he was picked up by French troops, who reunited him with Maj Fernie and the compass.

It reads: “Following our decision to close our stores almost eight weeks ago we’ve been working tirelessly on preparing our stores for reopening with enhanced health and safety measures and strict social distancing guidelines to ensure we offer the safest shopping environment for you. “Given the change in government guidance on st May to include Homeware as essential retail in England, we are now pleased to inform you that we are starting to reopen selected stores.” Below, is the latest Government advice and the shops which can and canapost open.

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Sky: I know there are a lot of campsites that are very keen for people to come.  Some of this is being carefully considered, recognising that we have a reduced outdoor transmission risk, that things like camping may well become suitable. But that is a decision that still needs to be taken for later this year, potentially in July or even later in the year, recognising that we need to do all we can to keep that R rate below one, the number of infections down, and we need to be careful when we take those steps.

The company says that prices for these holidays have been adjusted to reflect the experience and guests who already have breaks booked during this period will not be affected at this stage. Gerard Tempest, guest and proposition director, said: “We have thousands of guests who have already had breaks cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  “We look forward to reopening our parks as soon as government advice allows and as soon it is safe to do so, and are busy making changes to the way we operate our parks to ensure we can comply with the latest requirements.

Aya Hachem, a University of Salford student, was an aposinnocent passerbyapos in the alleged drive-by shooting in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Sunday. Three men from Blackburn have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the daylight attack. New footage shows the teen walking on the pavement as a Toyota Avensis appears to slow down ahead of her. She then collapses to the floor, in footagehas chosen not to publish, as the vehicle speeds off down Bank Top. Police say a number of bullets were fired from the vehicle, with one of them hitting Aya. Witnesses claim the shooter was targeting Quick Tyres and Quick Shine Car Wash.  A local resident claimed online: The aim, I believe, was to shoot out the glass in the big main window of the tyre place near Lidl. He missed and shot the lady. A Toyota Avensis with the registration SV UBP was later found abandoned nearby. The Sun has published CCTV of the shooting and also reported that the teen suffered a gunshot wound to the chest.

However,you have diabetes type  or prediabetes, regular exercise is crucial to improve your blood sugar control. Getting fit will also reduce your risk of suffering from further complications such as heart disease and stroke. But you don’t have to become a marathon runner overnight – or indeed start any form of extreme workout. Instead, just increasing your activity levels by a moderate amount can make a huge dference. Always consult your doctor before starting any new exercise plan, especiallyyou have diabetes or any other underlying conditions. How does exercise help with diabetes  When you move about more, your muscles work harder, which means they use up more of their favourite fuel – glucose . Because exercising requires your muscles to burn off excess glucose for energy, it lowers your all-important blood sugar levels. Dr Sarah Brewer says: “Exercise is incredibly important for diabetic patients. It lowers blood sugar and stress levels, which make it helpful in both preventing the disease and controlling it.” How much is enough  People with diabetes type  or prediabetes should get the same recommended  minutes of moderate exercise a week as the rest of us – but should take care not to miss more than two days of exercise in a row to maintain a healthy weight and steady blood sugar. In other words, about  minutes of exercise, five days a week. Aerobic activity at moderate intensity basically means exercising at a level that raises your heart rate and gets you a little bit out of breath. This can include outdoor pursuits such as brisk walking, gentle jogging, bike riding, tennis and golf – all of which are now allowed. Break it up To make the -minute weekly target even more achievable, your daily exercise quota can be broken up into -minute chunks throughout the day, so it’s easier to fit in. With a bit of imagination, most days in lockdown are full of opportunities to get your body moving. Pick and mix from the following activities to help make up your  minutes of exercise, five days a week target. Move to the beat Play your favourite music loud and get moving at home. Dancing is one of the best forms of exercise and is great for losing weight, improving posture, boosting mood and beating stress. Just  minutes of jiving can burn nearly  calories. And the more energetic your moves are the better.  A good clean win Spending so much time at home can mean we have to clean the house more than ever, so why not put in a bit of added elbow grease and make it count as exercise  For example, mopping the floor for  minutes burns  calories, while vigorous vacuuming can burn  calories an hour. The bonus is you’ll be left with a gleaming house! Get the garden sorted Gardening is great exercise that you don’t even realise you’re doing on a nice day outside. Researchers at Kansas State University found it could help strengthen your limbs, boost your heart health and encourage flexibility. And just half an hour of proper digging will burn up to  calories! So get weeding, pruning and mow that early summer lawn. You could even boost your diet and save cash by growing your own veg. Spending time in the garden also has the added bonus of boosting your levels of Vitamin D – the immune-boosting nutrient made by sunlight on skin - which can become deficientwe spend long periods indoors. Workout in your home office It’s amazing how many calories you can burn while sat down – just by moving your limbs a bit more. If you’re at a home desk, try marching your feet up and down on the spot for a few minutes – this will work the large muscles in your legs. For easy calf exercises, simply raise your feet up on the toes and lower them. And to tone your tummy, sit up straight and pull your stomach muscles in towards your spine. Keep breathing normally and hold this position for  seconds. Count your steps Hit the well-known , steps a day target for a full week and you will have done roughly the same level of activity as the recommended  weekly minutes of exercise. However, even with the more relaxed lockdown, we’re all typically walking less at the moment. Soyou have a pedometer, a fitness tracker or even an iPhone, which all have built-in activity monitors, carry it at all times to check you’re achieving the target number of steps each day. A few steps short today  Use the extra daylight to head outside for a brisk evening walk. Lt some beans You can exercise without any equipment at all – saving the cost of buying expensive gym kit. For example, why not use a couple of cans of baked beans to strengthen your arms  Simply hold your “weights” down by your sides with your palms facing forwards. Then, without moving the upper part of your arms, slowly bend your arm at the elbow, bringing the cans up to your shoulders. Return to the starting position, keeping each movement slow. Repeat - times per arm.

Using the working name Sweet Arches, the -year-old is funding her studies with her unusual sideline job, but warns itaposs far from an easy way to make a quick buck. Admitting to having a food fetish herself, Sweet gets up to  messages a day with unusual photo requests. She said: “Some people like the soles of the feet, some like the toes, some like to see them in dferent positions. “People like to watch me crush things, like raspberries, grapes or cakes with my toes. I’ve actually had someone ask me to squish ants, but that’s a no no for me. Anything that’s living, I won’t do that! “The strangest request was from someone asking me to run him over in my car! I said absolutely not. That’s definitely the craziest thing I’ve refused to do. Working in a hospital, I thought that would be quite counter-productive! “Some fans like ‘self-foot worship,’ where I play with my feet on camera. Others ask me to suck, kiss or lick my toes, or ask for me to send them worn boots or shoes. “One client asked for a pair of my boots. A lot of people with a foot fetish like the stinky smell, but it’s super hard for me to get my feet to stink. The client was still happy though, even though they smelled like my coconut foot mask!  Sweet, who lives in Portland in Oregon, US, also works in a hospital theatre, but earns a lot more with her foot work - often up to £, a year. “After one month of doing this, I tripled my hospital income as a surgical assistant - which is ,before tax. It’s insane. “Having a foot fetish myself, I started doing it for fun a year ago, just to share pictures of my cute feet. I didn’t think I could make a living from it.” Sweet Arches says she has been fascinated by her own and other peopleaposs feet since childhood.  “I have always had a foot fetish, enjoying pedicures and making sure my feet look good,” she recalled. “Even when I was very young, Iaposd always compliment people on their feet or randomly give foot massages to my friends, whereas most people think feet are weird. They would call me gross. “Then, about two years ago, a friend showed me that there was a whole community of others like me online, so I ed right in. I was so happy to find like-minded people.“I set up my own page on Instagram in May  and started posting pictures and videos every day. I had no idea what I was doing, but looked at other sites for inspiration, then a few bigger pages gave me a shout out, so my followers went up.“Now I have , followers on Instagram and , on Twitter.”Sweet now also has an OnlyFans account - a website which allows users to pay a subscription for exclusive content. “I direct everybody to my OnlyFans site, so they can request videos or pictures,” she said. “I’m still on a learning curve with it all. Some girls will offer pornographic videos or pictures, but I do not do that. “There’s all kinds of dferent stuff and you can make it your own.” As well as fans paying monthly subscriptions and buying inidual videos or custom content, Sweet Arches receives tips in the form of gts and recently enjoyed a day out at a spa.  She keeps custom videos to a minimum, so she has time to keep on top of requests and messages. She said: “I now have almost , subscribers on Only Fans, and usually get  to  messages or requests a day, so it is a lot to get through -  although I have a friend who used to be a porn star, who gets more than ,. “Mine are mostly to do with feet, but there are requests for other pictures. “I never get fully naked. I do respond to some risqué requests, but Iaposm cautious. “Everybody is super respectful, though. Eventhey are asking me for something and I tell them I’m not willing to do it, they are still really polite. “But I do get sent, shall we say, pictures of male anatomy. That is a hazard of the job!” Keeping her fans happy means Sweet Arches ensuring that her feet are always in tip top condition.  “I do my own pedicures and manicures twice a month, she said. Often I will go for natural or nude nail colours, but I will also take requests from people. “I love a foot mask, too, and have a double-sided pumice stone in the shower that I use every day. “I thinksomeone takes care of their feet, the rest of their body will look good. Feet and hands are so overlooked, even though research shows that feet are as sensory as the bodyaposs more intimate areas.Now Sweet Arches - who says her friends and family fully support what she does - admits that, since starting her OnlyFans site, she has also developed a hand fetish and says her work has helped her to feel empowered. She said: “I feel in control of my body and I can say yes or no to requests. I’m so passionate about it and have so much respect for the foot fetish community.” But she does receive some negative messages about her fetish work. “Most of the messages I get are really nice, but I will get the odd vomit emoji, she said. The most negative thing I’ve heard is that I’m fat or a chubby girl – and that doesn’t bother me at all. “I’m so thankful that I’ve been able to make an income from this and that I can pay for my studies. My ultimate goal is to be able to help my mum to retire. She is in remission from cancer and has been continuing to work as an auditor and quality line leader through her recovery. She is a power house and Iaposd love to be able to help her.” But, with unemployment rising due to the Covid- pandemic, Sweet Arches is cautioning against people thinking that selling pictures of their feet is a quick way to make money. “It takes time and commitment to get to where I am now and you do have to have aesthetically pleasing feet, like I do,” she said.

The  new cases are believed to be linked to the same source, as officials investigate how the first person caught Covid-. According to Chinese media six officials from both cities have been removed from their pots following the new cluster of cases. New measures in the province of Jilin have seen trains and buses have been cut off, schools shut, and thousands being put into strict lockdown. Chinese people in the area have expressed their frustration at the new measures which have quashed hopes that le could soonto normal. “Everyone is jittery,” said Wang Yuemei, a pharmaceutical factory worker in neighboring Tonghua, told  Bloomberg News.“I never ever expected Jilin province to be a hard-hit area when the whole country is getting back to normal now.” Shulan went into lockdown last week quarantined some , people in a failed bid to contain the second outbreak. Fengman District has recorded  cases of local infection in the same period and was put on lockdown on Monday after a -point directive from the local health commission. The travel restrictions include bans on all outbound foot and vehicle traffic, as well as the closure of schools and entertainment venues such as cinemas, gyms and restaurants. Residential districts have been put on closed management, with each household allowed to send one member to shop for essentials once a day. All shops and the majority of supermarkets in the districts also shut on Monday, reports added, while city officials were also gathering testing kits and protective equipment for health workers. Images show shutter doors closed and streets barricaded and nearing empty as the restrictions came into place at the weekend.  Following an order on May , the Jilin Ice Sports Center was converted into a field hospital in  hours and is now ready to accept patients. It was still unclear which category of patients would be sent to the winter sports arena. Last week, footage also showed secondary school pupils being sent home as case numbers grew. Classes had only just resumed on April  after much of China declared victory of the coronavirus outbreak. It comes as the city of Wuhan ordered all  million residents to be tested for coronavirus.  Dubbed the ‘-day battle’, the Chinese city officials launched a campaign on Thursday, May , after the Wuhan Health Commission announced a cluster of six new infections - the first since the city ended its two-month lockdown on Wednesday, April . Authorities have said the ambitious plan may be the only way to identy all asymptomatic carriers in the city, where residents remain wary and concerned about a second wave of infections.

The new strains of the virus were reportedly found in Gabon, Africa, but it is not clear whether they can spread to humans.According to NewScientist, experts from the Franceville International Medical Research Center recently tested more than a thousand bats living in caves across the country and found that  of them had coronavirus.The research found that five of the new seven coronaviruses are linked to previous strains that were linked to humans. These include the human coronavirus E that has been circulating among humans since the s, which usually causes only mild cold symptoms. This has led to the scientists speculating that the new coronaviruses could spread to humans, causing another pandemic, but added further research would need to be done first. Genetic sequencing also showed that seven of these coronaviruses, all of which have been found in bats that eat insects, have been completely unknown so far. Speculation continues as to where this particular coronavirus, which has brought the world to a standstill, originated from. The Covid- genome is thought to have come from bats captured from caves in Yunnan. The caves are , miles away from Wuhan, the Chinese city which is now infamous for having been the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. Scientists say it is highly likely that Covid- first came from bats, but first passed through an intermediary animal before jumping to humans. It is widely believed that the flu-like virus first began infecting humans in late  after being transmitted from an animal at the Huanan seafood market. However, UK government sources said that while the balance of scientic advice is still behind the animal market theory, an accident at a Wuhan laboratory is no longer being discounted. The experiments, which relate to the origin of coronaviruses, are said to have been paid for by a .m grant from the US government. Funded by the US National Institutes of Health, the results of the research were published in November  under the heading: Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus. Scientists are uncertain about several aspects of the origin of Covid-, with fresh doubts also arising last week following research by Cao Bin, a doctor at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which found that  of the first  diagnosed patients had not had any contact with the market. However, responding to the claims, the Chinese Embassy has described speculation around the labaposs activities as hasty and reckless allegations.

To be fair, I am usually like that before a big game.“I had already gone through everything in my mind about what I wanted to do on the pitch and how to prepare.”Conway, who has also played for Cardf City and Blackburn Rovers, added: “There was little in the final itself as we went in at half-time with the scores level.“But I was always sure thatwe kept doing what we had been doing the first goal would come.“Thankfully it did and then I was able to get my two goals as well.“It is something you are always asked: ‘Is it the sort of thing you dream about when you are a kid,’ and genuinely it is.“When you are playing in the park with your mates, you hope that one day you can score in the Scottish Cup Final so to do it was one of the highlights of my career and one of the best feelings you can get.“Once the final whistle goes, it is all a bit of a blur but it was just great to see the sheer delight on everyone’s faces.“It is so hard to put into words exactly how you felt but there was a massive sense of achievement.”After the trophy was handed to United, the celebrations really took off on the way back to Dundee before the players partied the night away alongside ecstatic fans, with Conway heading for his favourite city night spot.“It was just carnage on the bus with all sorts of nonsense back to the club and then it was into the town to celebrate,” said the seven-times-capped ex-Scotland star.“I’d had a lot of nights out in Fatties but everyone was just having a great time and it was the best atmosphere ever there.“Everybody was absolutely buzzing and it was great to be able to celebrate with the fans.“Everyone was together like a big family.“After a couple of hours’ sleep, we then had the parade on the open-top bus.‘To be honest, a lot of us were still drunk!

I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.43178506-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.43178506-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.43178506-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.43178506-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united dundee fc craig conway kyle letheren salford","story":"Dundee United hero Craig Conway and ex-Dundee keeper Kyle Letheren are free agents after leaving Salford City.Letheren, a Championship winner with the Dark Blues in , announced his departure from the high-profile League Two side co-owned by Manchester United’s Class of  legends including David Beckham, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes on Twitter.He wrote: “I’d like to wish Salford City FC all the best for the future.

Looking forward to the next chapter.”Salford later confirmed Conway – whose Scottish Cup Final double for United against Ross County was ten years ago on Friday – was among  stars released by the Greater Manchester outfit managed by former Scotland full-back Graham Alexander.They said: “We would like to thank each and every player for their considerable efforts on behalf of the club and extend our sincere best wishes for the future.”Conway, , played  games for Salford in   after joining in October following five-and-a-half years at Blackburn Rovers.The winger, capped seven times for the national team, left the Tangerines for Cardf a year after his Hampden heroics.Last week he said: “It is so hard to put into words exactly how you felt but there was a massive sense of achievement.“The  years have just flown by but there will always be a special bond with the lads.“It was one of the best days of my career and my medal still has pride of place in a room in my house.”Letheren, meanwhile, signed for City on a one-year deal last summer, making  appearances after two League One campaigns with Plymouth Argyle.The -year-old joined Dundee in  from Kilmarnock, where he had been on the bench for their League Cup triumph a year earlier against Celtic at Hampden.He came tantalisingly close to realising his dream of playing for Wales during his time in the City of Discovery after being called up by Chris Coleman for a Euro  qualying clash with Andorra.The goalkeeper – who has also starred for the likes of Swansea, Blackpool, York and Barnsley – endeared himself to the Dens faithful with his match-winning save late on in the dramatic win against Dumbarton that sealed a Premiershipsix years ago.Former Manchester United and Everton midfielder Darron Gibson, , is also one of those looking for a new team after playing just four times for Salford during their maiden Football League season.Craig Conway reveals the film he watched with Jon Daly the night before United#s  Scottish Cup triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp craig-conway-film-jon-daly-dundee-united-scottish-cup embed # secretDwWuDfxX\" data-secret\"DwWuDfxX\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e218883aa2074.61826575-909x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united ian harkes grandfather coronavirus","story":"He could hardly have been further away, but the coronavirus pandemic hit close to home for Dundee United midfielder Ian Harkes.His grandfather, Ron Kunihiro, had been fighting Covid- since early March with Harkes stuck in Dundee unable to catch a flight back to America.Thankfully, now at their family home in Virginia and by his side, Harkes has witnessed the -year-old recover.“I was just happy to get home. My granddad got out of the hospital and he’s been battling Covid,” the -year-old said.“He’s had it for a while. It’s been a long process which started back in the beginning of March when he first started to feel ill.“He went in to the hospital for  days or so. I was still in Dundee so we had to FaceTime or Zoom call the family to keep updated on everything.“Thankfully, we were able to find some flights and get back over.“He’s healthy now which is great. It’s been great to see him recover and nice to be here with the family.“The challenge now is getting back over to Scotland but, thankfully, I’ve got a UK passport so I should be OK!”Harkes travelled back to the states with fiancée and Celtic Women’s player Sarah Teegarden a few weeks back.Their wedding plans are on hold and the country is in disarray but Harkes insists it’s nice to spend precious time with his loved ones.He continued: “She was able to come back as well which is good.“It’s nice to spend time together but all our wedding plans will be pushed back now.“On the mental side being back with them all helps tremendously, missing them throughout the year.“They came over around Christmas time but seeing them again six months later has been big. It always gives me a lt.“It’s a bit dferent here than the UK. Some things don’t seem so shut down but that’s just America right now – we’re not quite sure what’s going on.“It’s quite crazy just now with the amount of cases and, unfortunately, the amount of deaths we’ve had in America.“I think the country’s a little bit all over the place, some places are opening up and some are closed, but right now we’re still in lockdown in Virginia.“All the states are dferent but it’s been OK here.“I’m not sure how long that will be but we need to be safe, especially with having that experience in my family.“I think we’ve all had a little bit of a dferent view towards it but we’ll see how it goes and hope for the best.“We can still exercise and things like that. I’ve had space to go and run and cycle, do some things in the yard and touch a ball every day.“It’s been good to have certain resources back home and to keep doing stuff.”Like most, lockdown has been a test for Harkes’ mentally and physically. For him, it’s a challenge he soon hopes to rise to on the pitch.Harkes added: “It’s definitely been a challenge on both sides but, thankfully, the club provided us with a great fitness programme before we went on furlough to keep us ticking over.“I’ve been active and all of us want to be flying when we finally get the go-ahead to get back to playing.“We’re all trying to push each other and push ourselves.“On the mental side, the way we ended was a little tough because we wanted to play for the fans and finish out the season.“We really felt like we deserved the title and we knew it then but we just wanted to finish off the games and prove it to everyone.“We’ll have that desire to get back on the pitch and play hard when we finally get it going.”The United support have taken to Harkes since he joined the club in January last year, as much for his flowing locks as his skill on the pitch.He is pleased to inform them nothing has changed on the hair front in lockdown but that he might soon be forced to take matters into his own hands.“I’m still going strong but it will be cut before everything gets going again,” Harkes said.“I think it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.“I don’t want to start putting it up in a bun and everything.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

found more deterioration of the roots and lower stem of the tree.These recent discoveries, along with other issues in its upper crown, meant the only safe option was to remove the whole tree and

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children. Number one rule: dad must never sit on it, but he can pull it.The term rod for my own back comes to mind."},{"url":null,"title":"tourism-impacted-covid-19-lockdown-says-mp","story":"LAST weekendrsquos Bank Holiday would normally have seen East Lothianrsquos beaches crowded and towns and countryside thronged with visitors.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

When a montage of Nigelrsquos le ndash which had clearly been a wonderfully happy one ndash was played at the end, I found myself choking back the tears.And Iwasnrsquot the only one, as the extraordinary outpouring of grief for Nigel has highlighted. Don spoke movingly of the ldquoNigel-shaped hole that now exists in his le, and it is testament to this particularly good boy that so many viewers also felt such acute loss at his passing.At a deeper level the reaction also relates to the terrible and frightening times we are living through, while speaking to the ability dogs have to comfort and heal human beings ndash even through a television set.:Garry Scott: Its a dogs le under lockdownldquoPure is the word Don used to describe Nigel, and many of us will recognise and cling to this quality in our canine companions as the coronavirus wreaks misery and chaos all around. Dogs face each day with the same enthusiasm, find the same unbridled joy in every single throw of the ball and rub of the belly. Who doesnrsquot envy a dogrsquos ability to live purely and fully in the moment, even this uniquely awful, scary one They are also natural comedians, of course, and at this point I must give special mention to BBC Sport commentator Andrew Cotterrsquos viral videos featuring his labradors Mabel and Olive. All three surely deserve awards ndash and maybe a letimersquos supply of Bonios ndash for their service to the nation during the pandemic.The unconditional love given freely by dogs, and their unembarrassed reliance upon our reciprocation, is quite overwhelming in its purity. It can be a lesaver, too. Don has talked publicly about his struggles with depression over the years, reiterating how his dogs helped him through the darkest times. Many reading this now will be able to relate. Even those who have never suffered from clinical depression may find themselves struggling to negotiate the loneliness of lockdown. At the most fundamental level dogs give us something to live for, something to get out of bed for. They love us evenwe donrsquot love ourselves. They heal us gladly, unknowingly, just by being themselves.And thatrsquos medical fact. Scientic studies show how dogs reduce stress, depression, loneliness and anxiety. They make us healthier, physically and mentally, by encouraging us to take exercise and socialise. People with dogs have lower blood pressure and are less likely to develop heart disease than others. Just playing with a dog releases enough dopamine to give you an instant high.Irsquove come to rely on this dopamine fix.

And they encourage us to find even a small amount of happiness in every moment, regardless of how bleak it seems.:Susan Swarbrick: How dogs are enriching our lives more than everAs humanity tries to find a way through the coronavirus our ability to understand its signicance is both a blessing and a misfortune. With this in mind, I canrsquot help thinking the tears I cried for a TV dog I have never met perhaps represented a deeper grief for the loss of innocence the crisis has forced upon us all.In the meantime, rest in peace dear Nigel.

She pays in cash, he puts it in the till and thanks her.There follows an awkward silence.ldquoWell  she says.ldquoWell what ldquoCan I have it ldquoHave what ldquoThe thing I just bought.ldquoOh that  No.ldquoIrsquom sorry ldquoNo, you canrsquot have it.ldquoBut Irsquove just paid for it.ldquoI know.ldquoSo whatrsquos the problem ldquoWell unfortunately, he sighs sadly, ldquoour policy has changed.ldquoSince when ldquoSince just after I put your money in the till.ldquoWell. Can I have my money back then He frowns sympathetically, but shakes his head.ldquoWhy not ldquoPolicy, he shrugs, and beckons the next customer forward.Now admittedly Irsquove never been very good at telling jokes, butyoursquore not splitting your sides right now that may be because this story currently feels a bit too real.Because this scenario is essentially whatrsquos happening to people all over the country at the moment as some airline companies, event planners and other suppliers refuse to refund people after a cancellation.Recent hits on the refund pages of our Advice for Scotland website have risen by  per cent, suggesting that the problem is not just a few isolated incidents. Yesterday, with their consent, we published the stories of some of those affected. These cases were shocking, but not un-typical of the broader numbers we are seeing: people who have shelled out thousands of pounds and are struggling to get it back.In many cases these are people who have scrimped and saved or dipped into their savings for the holiday of a letime, or their dream wedding, only to see that dream crumble in cancellation ndash and then find that they have to fight to get refunded. Many have told us of the misery of spending hour after hour, day after day on the phone, bouncing between endless muzak, recorded messages and inflexible agents. Instead of cash, some companies are urging devastated customers to take a voucher: a voucher with a deadline.Of course some say that the companies concerned didnrsquot cause the pandemic and they should therefore be able to keep the money.Otherwise, it is argued, they may have to lose staff or they may even go bust. While we sympathise with any business that is adversely affected by the current crisis, wersquod point out that their customers didnrsquot cause the pandemic either, and many of them too are struggling with reduced incomes, furloughs and redundancy.Moreover, the Government has provided employers with means of retaining their workers and staving off the receiver. Inidual consumers cannot be expected to subsidise business by effectively giving an un-willing donation to companies who have let them down.Itrsquos important not to over-complicate this. The most basic consumer principle of all is that when you pay for something, you should get that thing, in good order, andyou donrsquot you are entitled to your money back. When these peoplesrsquo flight wedding holiday was not provided, they should be refunded. And yet it seems many are facing a brick wall.So whatrsquos to be done  Well, this is the kind of situation where it pays to have a strong consumer protection landscape like the one Scotland and the UK have built in recent years.The establishment of Consumer Scotland, following the Holyrood vote earlier this month, is just the latest iteration of the idea that consumers have power, and that they should be both enabled and encouraged to stand up for their rights.But this trend of refund refusals will be a good test of whether our consumer landscape is actually fit for purpose. In other words, is it a real safety net for consumers, or just a source of warm words and good intentions We at CAS are doing our bit by offering advice and support to those affected, and by raising public awareness of the problem. What must happen now is that the regulators ndash those who have actual powers to clamp down on bad practice and force rogue companies to do the right thing ndash must act. The law is clear. If businesses wonrsquot follow it and provide proper refunds, they should be compelled to do so, or penalised.The alternative is that we all just abandon the most basic consumer right of all, and accept that you can pay for something, not get it and never see your money again.Now that would be a joke. But, like mine, just not a very funny one.Kate Morrison is Citizens Advice Scotlandrsquos spokesperson on markets."},{"url":null,"title":"no-10-distances-therese-coffey-suggested-govt-mistakes-wrong-scientific-advice","story":"Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman praised the members of the Governmentrsquos expert SAGE group, saying the Prime Minister was ldquohugely grateful for the hard work and expertise of the UKs world-leading scientists weve been guided by their advice throughout and we continue to do so.He then insisted: ldquoScientists advise, ministers take decisions and thats how Government works.Earlier, Ms Coffey raised eyebrows when she was askedwith \"hindsight\" the Government had made mistakes in its approach to the Covid- outbreak.The Work and Pensions Secretary told Sky News: ldquoYou can only make judgements and decisions based on the information and the advice you have at the time.\"If the science was wrong,the advice at the time was wrong, I am not surprisedpeople think we made the wrong decision.\"Meanwhile, a top Government advisers said the transparency of scientic advice to ministers during the coronavirus outbreak would be a \"big issue\" in a future inquiry into how the crisis was handled.At the daily Downing St press briefing, Professor Dame Angela McLean, the Deputy Chief Scientic Adviser, said she had not spent much time worrying about how secretive or not scientic advice was.Speaking alongside her George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, insisted the Government had been \"candid\" in sharing information with the public.Their comments came after the Commons Science and Technology Committee said further transparency was needed over the provision of scientic advice, providing clear distinction between scientic advice and policy decisions.Dame Angela said advisers had been \"really, really focused\" on giving high quality advice \"completely rooted in evidence\" not on how publicly available it was.She added: \"I have to admit I havent spent much time worrying about how secretive and not secretive it is.

I am ashamed that any Scottish public health official should try to justy what happened with regard to the Nike conference in Edinburgh , but the responsibility for this failure of public duty lies squarely at the top.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.THE lting of the Scottish lockdown depends on an effective track and trace mechanism. The events at the Edinburgh Nike conference at the end of February do not instil confidence in this system.Despite Nicola Sturgeons dismissal of the notion of a \"cover-up\" as political, it was certainly ineffective. Since the revelations by the BBC, a number of potential,not actual, victims from this original source have emerged. Track and trace never found them.There are still many questions to be answered over the handling of this and these answers must come urgently before lockdown is lted with track and trace as its replacement. Transparency is needed now from the ScottishGovernment, but it might have to include admitting to having made specic mistakes right from the start.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.THE incoming Royal Society president, the distinguished statistician Sir Adrian Smith, asked that political leaders such as Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon who are forever saying ldquowe are simply doing what scientists tell us should stop passing the buck and be more open about the advice they receive.A major failing of the coronavirus strategy north and south of the Border was how much decision-making went on in secret. He said: ldquoOpenness and transparency are essential. Its absurd the membership of Sage was only recently released and that the full minutes of its meetings are still a state secret.\"There was no rigorous assessment of the radically dferent approaches of other nations like Sweden and lack of transparency opened both governments to accusations they were part of the Oxford University-Imperial College epidemiological turf war which led to horses being changed in mid-stream.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.I NOTE that Neil Gaiman made his ,-mile trip from New Zealand via Los Angeles and London more than two weeks ago .I wonder , while sheltering in Skye, he has noticed the mysterious case of infections and  deaths in a Skye care home over the past two weeks and wondersit could be the result of people like him who seem to think stay at home and do not travel does not apply to them.My mother in law stays four miles away as the crow flies and my parents  miles from me.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality. We are also prioritising projects that will deliver local economic benefit within our communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved..."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

Agus lean i oirre le bhith a’ snìomh a snàithlein gach latha. Chùm i a dol airson còrr is dà cheud bliadhna mar sin, latha an dèidh latha, gu h-aonaranach anns a’ chaisteal aice air Creag an Fhithich.Faisg air dà cheud bliadhna an dèidh a bàis, bha Blàr Chùil Lodair ann, nuair a thàinig Ar-a-mach nan Seumasach gu ceann. Bha cuid de na fir à Gleann Eireachd air a bhith ann an arm nan Seumasach. Bha iad a-nise nan ruagalaichean. Nam measg, bha Niall Mòr nam Breac.Fhuair Niall a fhrith-ainm leis gun robh e fìor mhath mar iasgair-slait. Bha e a’ leantainn air feadhainn eile san teaghlach aige. Rinn fear dhiubh rudeigin math airson rìgh air choreigin. Dh’fhaighnich an rìgh gu dè an duais a bha e ag iarraidh. ‘Tha,’ thuirt e, ‘gum bi na h-uachdarain, air gach taobh dhen abhainn os cionn Bhlàr Ghobharaidh, a’ leagail a h-uile craobh a chuireas stad air iasgair bho bhith a’ siabadh le slat.’ Dh’aontaich an rìgh, agus bha còraichean iasgaich aig cinneadh Nèill fad bhliadhnaichean.Bha e nàdarrach, ma-thà, gum biodh Niall a’ dol am falach ri taobh na h-aibhne. Bha saighdearan dearga stèidhichte faisg air làimh ann an Srath Àrdail. Lorg Niall còs eadar na creagan, dìreach os cionn bonn Creag an Fhithich. Bha e toilichte gu leòr an sin. Ghlac e bric gu leòr anns an abhainn – dha fhèin is do fheadhainn eile a bha am falach faisg air.Bha e sàbhailte bho na saighdearan dearga, ach cha robh bho thuiltean. Bha uisge mòr ann an Srath Àrdail, agus thàinig tuil – coltach ri làgaraid – sìos Uisge Àrdail agus a-steach don Eireachd. Cha robh fios aig Niall gun robh e a’ tighinn. Gu h-obann thàinig an t-uisge a-steach don chòs aige, agus chaidh a sguabadh a-mach.Bha e ann an cunnart a bheatha. Ach, nuair a bha e fo Chreag an Fhithich, mhothaich e gun robh snàithlean crochte bhon bhearradh gu h-àrd.

Northern Ireland spokesman Lord Younger said there would be unfettered access for local businesses to the UK market.But he also acknowledged there will need to be light-touch checks for live animal checks and agroods, building on what already happens at Larne and Belfast.Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Empey told the Lords that ministers had repeatedly assured Parliament that no checks would take place on goods moving to or from Northern Ireland after transition. There is a widespread feeling that members have been consistently misled, he added.And Labour former Secretary of State Lord Reid warned that a clear breach of a vow given by ministers undermined trust in the Government.Yesterday Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves told the Commons: Peace in Northern Ireland was hard-won, we must not jeopardise it. In January the Prime Minister guaranteed unfettered access for goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland.Last week it was revealed that the Government would implement checks on some products crossing the Irish Sea and that there would be new infrastructure at ports coming from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland.So canconfirm whether these additional checks are being planned for when the road map for implementing the protocol will be published Mr Gove responded: Peace in Northern Ireland, she#s absolutely right, is critical and we will shortly be publishing a framework document on how we intend to implement the protocol in order to ensure that we have unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland into Great Britain and we preserve the gains from the peace process.Conservative MP and former Secretary of State Theresa Villiers said the customs compliance obligations under the protocol can be implemented without new physical inspections or infrastructure at ports. She added: In that case will he intervene with HMRC to stop them making preparations for new physical inspections and infrastructure at Northern Ireland ports  Mr Gove replied:makes a very important point. We are one customs territory. The protocol makes that clear, and we#ll shortly be publishing further details on how we intend to ensure Northern Ireland benefits from that.

We#ve been looking at the legislation and it doesn#t seem to allow for the FM transmitter we would need to put it into people#s cars, he continued.All it seems to allow for is  nanowatts to be transmitted which would only broadcast from the church to the front bumper of the first car. That#s not enough for people in the car park to hear it. I#ve contacted Ofcom about this a week ago but we#ve had no response. So we still don#t knowthis is even viable.The Executive has said fire ahead with these drive-in services, but they haven#t given us the wherewithal to do them so it#s really a bit of an empty gesture.An Ofcom spokesperson said: Understandably, the church community is exploring alternative ways of reaching their congregations. To broadcast as you describe, however, churches would require a Broadcasting Act licence to stay within the law. Ofcom would consider applications made for a restricted service licence, and information on the dferent types of licences is available on our website. When considering any application, Ofcom would carry out the work necessary to establisha suitable frequency can be identied for use at a power level appropriate for the proposed coverage area.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: I#m sorry that churches are not able to be exempt from licences on this occasion. Churches will understand the need to follow the law, but I would hope application processes will be as quick as possible.Elsewhere, a drive-in service is planned for this Sunday near the Giant#s Causeway at Dunseverick Baptist Church. Far from being a novelty, the outdoor services have been a popular fixture for years. Rev Billy Jones last held a service in March just before lockdown measures were introduced.Everyone needs hope at the moment, this isn#t about just going through the ritual of a service. If this achieves nothing , it will give people a lt just from seeing their family and friends across the car park.Rev Trevor McCormick is also aiming to hold outdoor services from next Sunday in both First Kilrea Presbyterian and the nearby Boveedy Church.

It is also a very apt description of the situation regarding GCSE, AS and A-level examinations this summer which, for the first time in living memory, have been cancelled, he said.I fully understand how unsettling and challenging it has been for the many thousands of students and their families who are directly affected by this unavoidable decision.I want to reassure students that at the centre of our thinking is making sure that the grades awarded are fair. Our goal is to give students the grades that best reflect what they would have achieved had they sat the exams in normal circumstances and completed all of their coursework.It has undoubtedly been an anxious time for students and their families, and I am grateful for their patience as we have developed a robust and deliverable solution Justin Edwards, CCEAThe grades for AS and A-levels will be issued on Thursday, August , with the GCSE grades a week later on Thursday, August .Students can have confidence that these grades will have equal status to any other year and should be treated as such by universities, colleges and employers, said Mr Edwards.For every GCSE, AS and A-level subject, CCEA has asked each school, college or other exam centres to submit a centre assessment grade for each student and the rank order of students within each grade.We will then use this data and other information to calculate the grades. CCEA will also apply statistical standardisation to align the judgments across and within centres so that, as far as possible, no student is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged in comparison to previous years.He said an appropriate appeals process is currently being developed for any student who feels that the grades received do not reflect performance.We firmly believe that teachers have an excellent understanding and knowledge of their students# performance and are best placed to provide the holistic and objective information that we need to calculate the final grades, he said.There may be some who feel that grades do not reflect performance. They may choose to sit the examinations at another time or they may wish to appeal. An appropriate appeals process is currently being developed. Public consultation on this work has been launched recently to inform the development process. Interested groups or iniduals are encouraged to contribute views online by Thursday May .It has undoubtedly been an anxious time for students and their families, and I am grateful for their patience as we have developed a robust and deliverable solution. Students can be assured that the grades they receive in August  will reflect their hard work, and it is our fervent aim that they will be able to progress as planned to the next stage of their journey.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

He will serve half of this in prison, with the remaining half on licence.Judge Smyth told Connolly: In my view it is dficult to contemplate a more terrying experience than finding a stranger dressed in black leaning over a vulnerable child in the middle of the night.The -year-old, whose address was given as Maghaberry, admitted five charges committed on August  last year, including breaking into the house occupied by the couple and their baby.At around .am on that date, a resident of Frenchpark Street saw a man carrying a yellow handbag over his shoulder. This man, Connolly, was seen turning on to Lecale Street and at around am the residents of a house on that street were woken by a hooded figure leaning over their sleeping baby. The couple noted a strong smell of alcohol from Connolly and when the male occupant leapt from his bed and towards Connolly he fled the bedroom. The incident continued in the living room and at this point Connolly shouted he had a kne and ran at the male resident.Despite this claim, the male occupant restrained Connolly and a neighbour arrived to offer assistance and police were called.While the couple did not sustain any physical injuries, they were both left in fear over Connolly#s claims that he had a kne.When Connolly was arrested and searched, items that had been stolen from two cars parked in Frenchpark Street, including a yellow handbag, were seized.Judge Smyth told Connolly that while the break-in displayed a lack of sophistication, there was a confrontation with the couple who were woken by the terror of finding you in close proximity to a sleeping child.The judge noted that whilst in custody, Connolly has missed several signicant events, including the birth of his first child. She also noted he had addiction issues and couldn#t remember the events of last August because of alcohol.Belfast Most ReadSDLP grassroots split on party#s selection to succeed John DallatDissidents linked to gun murder of Kieran Wylie in front of two daughtersArmed officers taser man wielding machete during stand-off in Belfast#s ArdoyneOfficer draws his gun in confrontation with man during Belfast house searchPSNI chief constable Simon Byrne approved sending officers home during pandemic- report,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Hunter and Ms Dallat O#Driscoll, who were both elected as councillors last year, were interviewed via Zoom.Mr Dallat , who was diagnosed with cancer last year, died a fortnight ago. He was first elected to the Assembly in .The interview  to choose his replacement consisted of party chairman and South Down MLA Colin McGrath, chief whip and Upper Bann MLA Dolores Kelly, and former SDLP general secretary Gerry Cosgrove.The party announced on Sunday that Ms Hunter had been selected. Supporters of both Ms Dallat O#Driscoll and Ms Quigley expressed their disappointment.In a statement last night, Mr McGrath said: The SDLP is delighted to have selected an energetic, passionate and impressive candidate as the next MLA for East Derry. Cara Hunter has a deep understanding of the issues people face in East Derry and she ed an outstanding performance in the Westminster election in December, adding almost  votes to the SDLP total. The party understands that this will have caused disappointment for those who were not successful. We value all of our members and public representatives and the contribution they make. We#re looking forward to continuing to grow in East Derry.Ms Hunter is deputy mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council. Following her selection, she said: It is an incredible honour to be selected to represent the people of East Derry and to follow in the footsteps of someone like John Dallat.John dedicated his le to public service and I know just how much he loved representing people here.I hope that I can continue that tradition of being a champion for everyone in East Derry.This is an incredibly dficult time for people, businesses and communities here.The impact of the coronavirus has been immense, it has caused pain for us all and it has underscored how little the things that ide us actually matter.This virus doesn#t see a dference between people in Coleraine or Kilrea, and neither should we. We all have to unite and come together as one community to keep each other safe.Warm tributes were paid from politicians across the ide to Mr Dallat following his death.

Tuesday saw the ninth edition of the County Derry Post without a match report, without an athletics update and without any kind of preview. Getting bogged down in feature and nostalgia pieces gives sports journalists the opportunity to chat with characters and legends from yesteryear. It is the perfect therapy. Living and working in isolation, is just how le is at the moment. You appreciate a daily run and the chirping birds all the more. Every day seems the same, but some things are dotted in to keep the week structured. googletag.cmd.push Joe McCloskey hosts a zoom quiz for our circle of friends, so that means it is Saturday at .pm. Fr Doherty delivers mass via the webcam, so that means it is Sunday morning at . and proofing pages means it is Monday and deadline time. Our daughter Erins school, St Brigids   Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted in Tirkane, have been excellent at rolling out enough work to keep her engaged. I play Muacuteinteoir Daidaiacute and set out a few tasks. Not a lot, but just enough to maintain some sort of structure. There is so much out there that is learning, the practical stuff. My we Pauline took her on a nature walk to pick wild flowers for a May altar. Granny Sally is teaching her how to grow tomatoes and the treehouse, crafted by Granda Mickey, is getting well tested. And all the teddies made an appearance in the garden to make a zoo, as shown in the picture above. googletag.cmd.push It is just great to be able to spend time with your family. Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

She said: “It is vital that democratic accountability and protection for ratepayers continues during the pandemic. “This is a crucial period for our ratepayers, families, businesses, employees and they will be depending on council to continue to provide service delivery and assist our community to get through this crisis. googletag.cmd.push “Council meetings are a vital part of that and I would expect them and other meetings to be held online now for the foreseeable future.” While there were some minor technical issues, the meeting mostly passed off successfully and there is hope that the public and press will be able to attend future meetings. Cllr McGurk said: “I would hope that this will ensure future meetings will be even more open and transparent. “This may even encourage greater access with members of the public who would never normally have attended a council meeting able to view meetings online from the comfort of their home. googletag.cmd.push “This can only be a good thing for democracy and allow the public a greater insight into the workings of decision-making bodies. “Tuesday’s online meeting of council is proof that we can adapt to work around some of the problems presented by coronavirus. “This crisis has pushed all sections of society to find technological solutions to the way we work and I firmly believe that the lessons learned from this will have a long term impact on how we continue to work after the pandemic has passed.” Details of future meetings to be held remotely will be published on the council’s website.

As revealed by the Derry News earlier this month, the proposed bridge would span an intake of water near the Fort George site, expanding the Quay Trail into Bay Road park. The planning application was received by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Service on March  and is in the early stages of consideration. The proposed bridge will provide a link from the city centre to Muff in County Donegal. It is part of the wider North West Greenway Network project which aims to develop .km of cross-border greenway, including: Derry-Buncrana, Derry-Muff, and Lford-Strabane. googletag.cmd.push  Funding for the project has been provided through the EU’s INTERREG VA programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body . Match-funding has been provided by the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, welcomed the submission of the planning application. She said: “I am delighted this key infrastructure project, which will complement the emerging City Deal riverfront regeneration plans, has reached this important milestone. Subject to planning approval, it will play a signicant role in connecting people through our infrastructure, facilitating more people to get outdoors and choose sustainable travel options, whilst benefitting peoples’ health and wellbeing.” googletag.cmd.push Paying tribute to everyone involved for advancing project development during this emergency period, Mayor Boyle continued: “Now, more than ever, there is a real need for investment in projects which encourage a more active, healthy lestyle. Once completed, the proposed new bridge will further enhance the City and District’s growing greenway network.” Gina McIntyre, Chief Executive of SEUPB said: “This bridge is an integral section of the North West Greenway Network’s route , which will link Derry to Muff. It will encourage more people to choose an eco-friendly form of travel, one of the core objectives of the EU’s INTERREG VA Programme, which has been designed to support more sustainable forms of transport, on both sides of the border.” She continued: ”It is also important, as we emerge from COVID- restrictions in the coming weeks and months, that we rebuild our society and the economy in a more environmentally-conscious way. This greenway will help support a more socially distanced recovery process, an approach that will pay real and tangible idends for us all in the future.” Further details on the project can be found at www.nwgreenway.

It will allow the first student intake of  in September , she explained, this is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. Speaking after todays Executive announcement where it agreed to establish medical school in Derry and the first student intake of  students in September, MLA for Foyle Karen Mullan said:Todays announcement by the Executive that it plans to establish the graduate medical school at Magee is a major boost for Ulster University and for Derry. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of this investment to the economic regeneration of Derry and to the North West cannot be overstated. I warmly welcome the decision which adds quite signicantly to the City Deals and Inclusive Future Fund commitment announced in recent weeks too. “There is widespread support for the medical school and the expansion of Magee. There is a united voice in the city at political and community levels and todays announcement represents a huge step forward towards the goal of delivering the medical school at Magee in the fastest time possible. Sinn Feacutein is committed to working with Ulster University, local business leaders and all other parties to see the project delivered without any delay. googletag.cmd.push While welcoming the Executive recommitting itself to a medical school as part of the expansion of Magee, SDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood called for further detail and guarantees on a September  intake. Mr Eastwood said that what’s needed now is more than warm words but a detailed plan and the resource needed to lt the project off the ground. Colum Eastwood MP said: “During the negotiations to restore power sharing, I made it a personal priority to secure not just a political commitment to the expansion of Magee but resource for developing the medical school. That was critical to SDLP support for the Executive. I welcome the statement from the First Ministers recommitting to university expansion in Derry today. “What people here need is more than warm words or restated promises. We need a guarantee from the Executive and from Ulster University that the first students will enrol starting in September  and we need to see a plan for university expansion beyond that. The medical school is the first step, not the end product. “I will work constructively with all parties to deliver on the potential of our university. Providing young people with the opportunity to study, work and make a le for themselves here is a priority for me. Today’s news must be something genuinely new, rehashing previous commitments or announcements will not be enough. Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said all parties have worked hard to secure the medical school. Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. During the Confidence and Supply Agreement, Gregory Campbell was able to bring the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to the City to show him the potential. Indeed, with support across the British Isles, this key project has been able to be moved in the right direction. It is a symbol of what can be done when people work together. I hope in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” The British Government backed a medical school in Derry in the New Decade, New Approach document. Former Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal also welcomed the news saying: Great news for Derry - such great community commitment to this project - well done to all involved in the campaign. A new decade and a new approach to ALL parts of Northern Ireland being delivered.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims.

In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

With thousands more claimants now trying to access welfare support – many for the first time – the pressure on local advice services has never been higher. Applications have sky rocketed, as employers struggle to source support for employees as well as secure the long-term future of their business, and families seek aid as they face the sudden stark reality of le without a regular income. googletag.cmd.push The community and voluntary sector in Derry has mobilised to provide a network of support, and one vital component in that resilience effort are the local advice service organisations who are providing round the clock guidance and information for those in most dficulty. They have seen a surge in demand for information on support mechanisms such as the Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support, Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit and mortgage advice. Jacqueline Gallagher is manager of the newly branded Advice North West – formerly Citizens Advice Bureau. Used to dealing face to face with their customers, they have been adjusting to the challenge of working remotely assisting people by email and phone and the limitations that brings. googletag.cmd.push Weve been so busy since we entered lockdown, it is a time of great uncertainty for many in our communities with a large volume of iniduals and families worried about their security of income, housing and employment, she explains. We have dealt with a large influx of people who have had to access the benefit system for the first time. “This can be a time-consuming process at any time but with the inability to provide face to face advice services we have had to be inventive in our approach to surmount the current social constraints and limitations. Its very tough for people who have never before had to navigate the benefit system and are now having to do so in such unexpected and upsetting circumstances. “They are afraid of not being able to pay back debts, losing their homes, not being able to feed their families – its an unbelievably anxious time. “The dficulty is that everyones situation is dferent, so each person needs a specially tailored approach. Our team dedicates themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of those who access our services. Jude McKinney is the Welfare Rights Manager of the Resource Centre Derry where the team has also been adjusting to new ways of working introduced to fast track services that are under increasing pressure. It really has been a challenge for our team, he admits. We definitely saw a major spike in demand for services at the start as we had a lot of new issues to deal with. We received advance funding from Council and we have been allocated additional money through the Community Fund which helped us to meet this initial demand for services. We anticipated having to cover a lot of additional hours to allow for the extra filling out of forms. “When we first entered lockdown we saw a huge surge in claims for things like employment benefit, self-employment support and the self-isolation job retention scheme. “Then when the furloughing scheme was announced – something which no one was familiar with – it was another challenge helping both employers and employees understand how the scheme works to benefit them. We can no longer facilitate face to face appointments which is in itself challenging and we anticipated it would mean a lot of extra out of hours work for our staff. But thankfully there have been some fantastic measures introduced by the Department for Communities in terms of easement. They stepped in to introduce a number of easement mechanisms including a six-month extension of payments for existing claims, which has meant we havent had to process a huge volume of renewal forms like for example Work Capability Assessments. “We can also now sign on a claimants behalf so they no longer have to come in to the centre to sign forms, which has been a big help. While this has given us a bit more breathing space we now anticipate there will be a spike in form filling come September and October. So there are definitely more pressures waiting down the line. Its hard to imagine how we will ever resume normal ways of working. I think this will all lead to a review of how we deliver advice services which will see it transformed in the long-term and I think we have a long way to go before we thingsto any kind of normality. Dove House is located in the heart of the Bogside in Derry, an area already suffering from high levels of deprivation. Welfare Advice Coordinator Donna Burke and the team of eight advisors based there have been inundated by calls from new claimants, but are buoyed up by the strength of the community resilience efforts in the area. I can see how it can be so frustrating for anyone trying to access benefits when there is so much uncertainty and change at the moment, weve had to adapt as best we can, she admits. The biggest concern is quite simply ensuring that people have enough money to live on. Its as basic as that. “With so many new claimants, they have to get registered which can be a complicated process in itself, but then we have to explain to them that they will have to wait until that support comes through which leaves people extremely anxious. “There can be no room for error. Thats upsetting for our advisors as well. Im so proud of our team – they are going above and beyond the call of duty every day – no one is turned away evenit means calling people back over and over again to make sure we can get them the help they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The announcement was made this afternoon at Stormont by the Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill. The first entry of students is planned for September . The new medical school has been welcomed byLondonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Redmond McFadden. “This is excellent news, not just for the North West region but also for Northern Ireland, said Mr McFadden. The hard work starts now to recover from the impact of Covid- both on the health of our population and on our economy. googletag.cmd.push A Graduate Entry Medical School will have a hugely positive impact on our regional economy and will provide a signicant boost to Northern Ireland’s healthcare workforce. By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other vital health professionals locally, we can signicantly bolster our health service, especially at a time when it is under extreme strain. Mr McFadden said that the necessary work was done to ensure that the first students can start at the medical school next year. “Everything must now be done to ensure the school is open and ready for its first intake of students in September . googletag.cmd.push The Covid- emergency has highlighted the importance of our health service. Finally delivering the Medical School would be a lasting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff during this crisis. “I am very pleased that we will finally have a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee. It is testament to the combined efforts of those across business, education, healthcare and politics, who have worked together on this campaign. As part of the wider City Deal for Derry City and Strabane, the Medical School will drive real economic and social change across the North West and help address years of underfunding and underinvestment in the region.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them.

Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

COVID- emergency funding for local councils.By The NewsroomTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"This morningCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, informed the Assembly that the Executive had agreed to provide a total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam
