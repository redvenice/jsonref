We’re seeing an explosion of interest in flat earth theories and increasing mistrust of governments.’In a speech, NHS worker David Marsh claims he has disproved planetary motion, using a Nikon camera and an app from his back garden.Marsh says, ‘My research destroys big bang cosmology. It supports the idea that gravity doesn’t exist and the only true force in nature is electromagnetism.’Some Flat Earthers claim that Earth is in fact moving upwards, and that’s what keeps us ‘pinned down’, rather than gravity.Belief that the Earth is flat has rocketed in recent years, with self-styled experts promoting the theory – along with some celebrities.In 2015, American rapper B.o.B. – aka Bobby Ray Simmons Jr – revealed on Twitter that he was a Flat Earther.Simmons said, ‘No matter how high in elevation you are…the horizon is always eye level…sorry cadets…I didn’t wanna believe it either.’Rapper B.o.B. (Picture: Getty)‘Don’t believe what I say, research what I say. I’m going up against the greatest liars in history … you’ve been tremendously deceived.’Simmons has since engaged in online debates with scientists, and attempted to raise funds for a rocket mission to establish whether the Earth is, in fact, flat.Pie company spiked its own chicken and bacon slice with chunk of metalFormer England cricketer ‘Freddie’ Flintoff revealed last year that he was obsessed with a podcast called the Flat Earthers – and coming round to their ideas.Flintoff said, ‘If you’re in a helicopter and you hover why does the Earth not come to you if it’s round?‘Why, if we’re hurtling through space, why would water stay still? Why is it not wobbling? Also if you fire a laser about 16 miles, if the world was curved, you shouldn’t be able to see it but you can.’Freddie Flintoff is Flat-Earth curious (Picture: Getty Images)He even claims to be warming to the idea of a global conspiracy to conceal the truth (something that Flat Earthers are naturally very fond of).He said, ‘The middle is the North Pole, around the outside is the South Pole which is like a big wall of ice. This is why all governments now have bases on the South Pole.’Former reality show star and model Tila Tequila is perhaps less of a surprising Flat Earth believer – as she’s known for bizarre and disturbing behaviour.Tila Tequila (Picture: WireImage)She was thrown off Celebrity Big Brother after images surfaced of herself dressed as a scantily clad Nazi in front of an image of the Auschwitz death camp.She also wrote a blog post entitled, ‘Why I sympathise with Hitler.’She Tweeted questions about the Earth being round – asking why buildings in New York would stand straight up, rather than tilt, if Earth was flat.In one outburst, she said, ‘I WILL STOP MY #FLATEARTH TALK IF SOMEONE CAN SEND ME A GOD DAMN PHOTO OF THE HORIZON WITH A CURVATURE!’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9823467.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david beckham unveils new scalp tattoo planets orbit love","story":"David Beckham unveils new scalp tattoo (Picture: Rex)David Beckham is no stranger to tattoos, having more than 40 inkings.But his latest design is a bit different to all the others, as it’s on his newly-cropped scalp.Victoria Beckham’s husband showed off his new tattoo, an inking of the planets in orbit, during a charity event in MacaoAnd, as ever, the former Manchester United legend manages to pull it off effortlessly.We’re kind of loving David’s new tattoo (Picture: Rex)Is there nothing he can’t do?But, while the 42-year-old is king of tattoos in the Beckham family, son Brooklyn might not be too far behind.At last count, the aspiring photographer had notched up 15 inkings just a year after he celebrated his 18th birthday.But that’s just the ones we know about – he could be getting inked as we write this.Among his ever-growing collection are four tributes to baby sister Harper, including a dancer on his right leg, and his younger siblings’ birth years on above his elbow.The 19-year-old also has two dedications to his dad – a ‘7’ on his finger and the word ‘buster’ above his belly button – as well as the word ‘mum’ in a heart on his shoulder, and ‘Mama’s boy’ above his actual heart.We wouldn’t put it past him…If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Harper Beckham shows off posh accent in cute video of her reading to her mumMORE: David Beckham aims subtle dig at Arsene Wenger critics in class tribute to Arsenal boss"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9813133.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"elizabeth olsen isnt happy boobs show avengers costume","story":"Elizabeth has just one want for her costume (picture: Marvel, Backgrid)Elizabeth Olsen has opened up about her thoughts on her Avengers costume, as the latest offering Infinity War smashes the box office.And, sorry to say, like Shania Twain, it didn’t impress her much.You see, the actress – who plays the powerful Scarlett Witch in the newly-released MCU epic – felt a little miffed she was the only woman whose costume showed off her cleavage, throughout the various sagas.‘It would just not be a cleavage corset. I like corsets, but I’d like it to be higher,’ the 29-year-old said, when asked by Elle about what she’d change on her costume. ‘Everyone has these things that cover them – Tessa Thompson does, Scarlett does.

And that’s a constant joke because they haven’t really evolved my superhero costume that much.’We have to say, her costume is perhaps a little more conservative in Infinity War, as opposed to Age of Ultron, when she was rocking a full on, busty corset.Still, she praised the MCU for sticking to their ‘iconic’ vision for the cast’s costumes, that continued to draw inspiration from the OG comics that championed powerful women.‘But then you look at where it started in the comic books and it was a leotard and a headband so…oh, it’s horrible, it’s so horrible,’ she added. ‘So at least they know that’s not cool. But then they made Wonder Woman, you know? And that’s what she’s in.‘I think of the costumes and what we have to wear—it’s more about iconic images, because that’s what these movies are…. I think that’s the goal with the costumes, and it’s not representing the average woman.’The actress – and sister of the Olsen Twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley – revealed recently she’d like to ‘explore’ the back story of her character.Talking to Digital Spy, Elizabeth revealed her hopes for Scarlet’s relationship with The Vision to be explored in more depth and said she would like the comic book back story to be brought into the movie.How much did Avengers Infinity War cost to make?Where was Valkyrie in Avengers: Infinity War?

Her resignation letter said she ‘inadvertently misled’ parliament.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt will also take on Ms Rudd’s former responsibilities as Minister for Women and Equalities, Downing Street announced.It follows intense pressure for Ms Rudd to step down over the Windrush generation crisis, which saw people who came to the UK as citizens detained in immigration centres, denied healthcare and threatened with deportation.The Hastings and Rye MP became the fifth minister to leave the Cabinet since last year’s snap general election.Her resignation letter said she took ‘full responsibility’ for not being aware of the existence of targets.Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to see her successor as home secretary leave the post, while Ms Rudd’s opposite number Diane Abbott said she had ‘done the right thing’.James Brokenshire becomes the new Communities and Local Government Secretary (Picture: PA)The pressure had been building on the former banker ever since the emergence of the ‘appalling’ treatment of Caribbean immigrants to the UK between the 1940s and 1970s – the so-called Windrush generation.Concerns had been raised about the immigration status of the Windrush generation and there had been stories of people being forced to prove their annual presence in the country for decades in order to prove they were here legally.Ms Rudd referred to the Windrush ‘scandal’ in her two-page resignation letter, admitting that people with a right to live in the UK had not always been treated ‘fairly and and humanely’.Opposition parties said she was paying the price for Mrs May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy towards illegal immigrants when she was Home Secretary which had led to people being wrongly stripped of their rights and threatened with deportation.Sajid Javid, left, with Amber Rudd, centre right (Picture: Getty)Diane Abbott said: ‘This was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.‘The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.’Ms Rudd had appeared to be prepared to ride out the storm announcing her intention to come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ ‘legitimate questions’ about the removals targets.She had previously apologised in the House for the ‘appalling’ treatment of the Windrush veterans, announcing a taskforce to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.However, she was criticised for saying the Home Office was ‘too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’, prompting accusations that she was trying to put the blame on civil servants.Her resignation follow those of former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel as international development secretary, Damian Green as first minister and James Brokenshire, who left his role as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds since June last year.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Home Office workers, said: ‘The Windrush scandal has highlighted how inhumane immigration policies coupled with cuts to Home Office staff and increased workloads is a recipe for disaster.‘The resignation of Amber Rudd should be a wake-up call to the Government to end the hostile environment they have created for people wanting to come to this country and to put a stop to the blame culture where Home Office staff carry the can for the failings of ministers.’MORE: Diane Abbott gets so much racist abuse her aides update police every weekMORE: Flood alerts issued as month’s worth of rain due to be dumped on Britain today"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/522060036.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"what does asda stand for","story":"Asda’s name is directly connected to how it was founded (Picture: Getty)Asda has just agreed to merge with Sainsbury’s to take on Tesco, with Walmart set to claim 42 per cent of the business.The billion-pound merger deal is just a bit bigger than the one which formed the basis of Asda some 53 years ago.That very deal gave Asda its unusual name, which unlike Sainsbury’s is not named after its founder (who was John James Sainsbury).So where does the name come from and what does it mean? Let’s find out.Associated Dairies Ltd was one half of the original Asda (Picture: Getty)Asda’s name comes from the two companies that came together and merged in 1965 after both first formed in the 1920s.Those firms were Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd, and the supermarket Queens, run by the Asquith family, who were butchers from West Yorkshire.When the Asquith brothers Fred and Peter approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain, a merger was suggested.An early Asda store in the 1970s (Picture: Getty)The Asquiths chose to join together with Noel Stockdale, one of the West Riding dairy farmers in charge of the other company, to form a new company.They chose the name Asda, combining the name Asquith and the term Dairies from the two respective company titles.The logo was at first not capitalised in the logo and on the side of the supermarkets, which sprung up in the late 1960s and through the 1970s.Asda as we know it today, with a capitalised Logo (Picture: Getty)The logo became capitalised in 1985 when a new green logo was introduced in an effort to revitalise the brand image.Following the recession of the 1990s, Asda faced bankruptcy and was eventually bought by Walmart on 26 July 1999 for £6.7 billion, trumping a rival bid from Kingfisher plc.A panorama of an Asda interior (Picture: Wiki Commons)The chain then grew again, and the stores grew larger, echoing the Walmart stores of the States.The headquarters of the chain remain at Asda House, South Bank, Leeds, West Yorkshire an the current CEO is Roger Burnley.MORE: Twin Peaks star Pamela Gidley dead at 52MORE: Does the Royal Mail deliver post on Sundays?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/21/4B54270B00000578-0-image-m-44_1524170616142.jpg","title":"Paris Hilton fianc Chris Zylka wed November","story":"    Paris Hilton, 37, and her fiancé Chris Zylka, 32, will wed in Beverly Hills, California, on November 11, a family insider has told DailyMail.com          Paris confirmed that she was engaged to Zylka in an Instagram post of the proposal in Instagram in early January           Paris and Zylka first met eight years ago at an Oscars party at Chateau Marmont but didn\u0027t start dating until 2016, finally making it official on social media in February 2017\u0027No one is quite sure of the significance of the \u00271111\u0027 wedding date, but that\u0027s what they\u0027ve chosen,\u0027 the insider told DailyMail.com. \u0027It\u0027s on a Sunday, but following day is a holiday (Veteran\u0027s Day) so it will be a long weekend celebration.\u0027Paris has strong ties to tradition and wants to have the wedding close to hope so her grandfather, Barron Hilton, can attend, the insider said.The church seats 600 people, and was also the site of Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s first wedding to Paris\u0027 great uncle Conrad \u0027Nicky\u0027 Hilton in 1950.

Here is what he said.Six top tips to secure a pay rise Following a decade long pay squeeze in the UK, many people have felt the financial pressure of stagnating wages and rising living costs. Wage growth and inflation moved closer together in the first three months of this year, but for most this doesn’t mark the end of the pay squeeze just yet. With talk of inflation set to rise again this year, it’s not surprising that a growing number of people are concerned about salary.Our latest data from reed.co.uk revealed that average salaries advertised rose 3 per cent during the first quarter of 2018. This is a clear indication that salaries are finally moving in the right direction.What’s more, the requirement for companies to disclose their gender pay gaps has sparked a lot more conversations around salaries. Many women working for organisations reporting a large gender pay gap are questioning the remuneration they currently receive.Irrespective of any gender pay gap your employer has reported, you will still need to be able to demonstrate your successes and what you plan to contribute in future to make a case for a pay rise. This applies to men and women equally.  AskSchedule a time to meet with your manager and talk about your career goals, the contributions you’ve made to the company and the value you intend to bring in future.          To make a case for a pay rise, you should show your successes and what you plan to contribute in future according to James ReedBalance your request for a pay increase with a commitment to extra duties you’re prepared to fulfill. By showing your intent to demonstrate value to the company, you will provide assurance that this will be money well spent.Know your valueCome prepared. Research your worth based on your level of experience in the industry and the going rate for the same role. You can use salary checkers and job descriptions to research advertised salaries for your role. Gather as much comparative data as you can so you’re entering any discussion prepared.Prepare for additional responsibility Go above and beyond your duties in your current role. Your company isn’t going to award you a pay rise for nothing. Make sure you can show what extra value you’ll bring to the company, be it taking on more responsibilities, or bringing more expertise to your role.Make sure you never stop learningExpand your knowledge by completing a course or reading up on the news in your industry.Show that you have the right mindset to do the jobAround 97 per cent of employers we asked said they’d prefer an employee with the right mindset over one with the right skill set.Skills can be taught, but mindset is more difficult to change.Keep the negotiation professionalIf the answer is no, ask for a time to revisit the possibility of a pay rise in the future - six months is usually the ideal. Although it may be difficult to hide your disappointment, try not to get upset or angry in front of your boss. The decision may be out of your manager’s hands.One year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/17/4B889F0200000578-0-Legoland_will_provide_free_entry_to_their_Windsor_Resort_park_fo-a-28_1524846725236.jpg","title":"Legoland free entry called Louis Royal baby naming","story":"    Legoland will provide free entry to their Windsor Resort park for a limited time to anyone who shares the same name as the Royal baby, His Royal Highness Louis Arthur Charles      It\u0026#8217s Gonna Be May: The story behind the Justin Timberlake NSYNC memeWho is Sajid Javid?

It’s very vibrant, very energetic, very different. He was probably covered in paint by the end. Is it a piece of performance art? I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow.

VERY protective rhino charges a herd...Share this articleFairfield Farm, in south Devon, is home to a herd of Guernsey cows. Run by Chris and Louise Carpenter, it makes Auntie Moo’s Golden Guernsey Ice Cream. The couple’s website says: ‘We are passionate about what we do and strive to create the most delicious ice cream and Guernsey beef.’At the farm, Viva found what the industry calls a ‘downer’ cow – a cow may ‘go down’ due to temporary nerve paralysis caused by calving difficulties or fatigue. Viva director Juliet Gellatley said: ‘On a wet, filthy concrete floor we came across a cow who was so ill she couldn’t move, not even lift her head.           Images from Fairfield Farm in south Devon, which showed some calves in small hutches - each one surrounded by a metal fence          One brown and white calf at the farm lies on the floor with large sores on its bodyHer body was wasting away and revealed large sores... We called the RSPCA and a local vet who... agreed with us that this poor creature was suffering and used his authority to put her out of her misery.’The vet, Howard Liebermann, said: ‘She was really dull and unable to rise and certainly she’s not on great bedding. There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’.

The Koreas had used the same time zone for decades before the North created its own Pyongyang Time in 2015 by setting the clock 30 minutes behind South Korea and Japan. While Pyongyang says it will close its nuclear test site next month, Kim and Moon did not outline concrete measures to be taken to achieve that goal of denuclearization. Trump\u0027s new national security adviser John Bolton said in an interview with CBS News, also aired Sunday, that Kim may have \u0027concrete and tangible\u0027 ideas about giving up his nuclear arms program \u0027and we should hear him out.\u0027But he and Pompeo cautioned that North Korea has a history of reneging on its commitments. Bolton said that a recent absence of weapons and missile tests by North Korea \u0027could be a very positive sign\u0027 or a sign that the programs have reached advanced stages and testing is no longer needed.

In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolition of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the U.S. and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package worth about $400 million.But the deal eventually collapsed after North Korea refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods, and the country went on to conduct its second nuclear test detonation in May 2009. Pompeo also said that at Trump\u0027s direction, he spoke with Kim about the release of three U.S. citizens detained by North Korea.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/02/4BB17C5B00000578-5672605-The_homestead_s_eerie_history_which_involves_a_number_of_deaths_-a-29_1525053143896.jpg","title":"Haunted tourist attraction scary visitors Australia","story":"    Oakabella Homestead, in the Western Australian countryside, has been forced to reconsider its marketing strategy in order to make itself less scary to potential visitors\u0027There are some articles we have read online and it is quite interesting to read the feedback,\u0027 said Ms Turner.\u0027Not everyone is into ghosts and that was definitely portrayed in the Facebook comments.\u0027People will not come here if they think it is haunted so that is why we are bringing it back to the history.\u0027          The homestead\u0027s eerie history - which involves a number of deaths at the site, and was previously exploited in the form of ghost tours - was keeping a lot of tourists awayThe new business model will aim to portray Oakabella Homestead less as a haunt of unruly spirits and more a place of endless horizons and rich Australian history.Stargazing, campfires and traditional bush tucker are just a few of the things in the revamped purview.\u0027We ourselves are more passionate about the history side of things,\u0027 said Mr Snelson.\u0027The spiritual ghost side of things is something we are a bit less believing in.\u0027           The notion of ghosts and spirits was proving a particularly hard sell for Chinese tourists          New business owners Belinda Turner and Brian Snelson are trying to reinvent the homestead\u0027s image, focusing on the location\u0027s heritage history, great outdoors and starry skies The issue, of course, is that not everyone seemed to be taking these tales of terror so lightly.Haunted homesteads can prove a tough sell for anyone with even the slightest of superstitions - and Chinese tourists in particular were steering clear of Oakabella.\u0027I am Chinese and I have lived in Australia but if you tell me that this place is the most haunted estate then I would be scared,\u0027 said Hanjie Davis, economic development officer for the City of Greater Geraldton. \u0027If you have ghosts, my first impression is that I don\u0027t want to go there. Don\u0027t forget your Geiger counter!

He was also publicly bisexual, an unusual thing to admit at the time, and something his brother found hard to come to terms with.Reggie was imprisoned two years later, but by 1960 both were out of prison and had become almost celebrities, socialising with stars such as Barbara Windsor, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, as well as well as eminent politicians including Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie had an affair.

He subsequently disappeared, and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder, a later book claimed that he had been shot.The same year, Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel. Cornell, an associate of South London gang, the Richardsons, is said to have remarked: \u0027Well look who\u0027s here\u0027 just before he was shot.And in 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 Mcvitie in Stoke Newington, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife, twisting the knife as McVitie lay dying.The brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968, when they and several members of The Firm were arrested, and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years.The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: \u0027In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\u0027They were allowed out of prison for their mother\u0027s funeral in 1982, but Ronnie died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/22/01E01DD0000004B0-0-image-m-110_1524950769198.jpg","title":"Youll need plenty chips Halibut weighing 15 stones caught North Sea","story":"    The halibut weighing 95 kilograms - or 210 Ilbs was caught in the North Sea off Scotland.

VERY protective rhino charges a herd...Share this articleFairfield Farm, in south Devon, is home to a herd of Guernsey cows. Run by Chris and Louise Carpenter, it makes Auntie Moo’s Golden Guernsey Ice Cream. The couple’s website says: ‘We are passionate about what we do and strive to create the most delicious ice cream and Guernsey beef.’At the farm, Viva found what the industry calls a ‘downer’ cow – a cow may ‘go down’ due to temporary nerve paralysis caused by calving difficulties or fatigue. Viva director Juliet Gellatley said: ‘On a wet, filthy concrete floor we came across a cow who was so ill she couldn’t move, not even lift her head.           Images from Fairfield Farm in south Devon, which showed some calves in small hutches - each one surrounded by a metal fence          One brown and white calf at the farm lies on the floor with large sores on its bodyHer body was wasting away and revealed large sores... We called the RSPCA and a local vet who... agreed with us that this poor creature was suffering and used his authority to put her out of her misery.’The vet, Howard Liebermann, said: ‘She was really dull and unable to rise and certainly she’s not on great bedding. There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

It was Pound who introduced him to vorticism, the short-lived British avant garde modernist movement created by artist and writer Wyndham Lewis as a reaction to the dominance of landscape and figurative art. Equally frustrated by the representative nature of photography, Langdon Coburn immediately sensed the liberating potential of the vorticist dynamic of geometric shapes and cubist fragmentation. In the Shape of Light, Langdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow, made using a set of mirrors to fragment the subject in an almost kaleidoscopic way, set the tone for an epic exhibition that traces the history of photography as experiment. Here, portraiture, landscape and documentary give way to abstractions – created either by manipulations of light and chemicals or by distorting or fragmenting the actual world. The result is a kind of mirror-history of the medium’s relationship to documentary and abstract art.  Spread over 12 rooms, Shape of Light is also a history of innovation, in which the darkroom and the studio are more akin to the laboratory. The early-to-mid-century masters of light and form are all present: Brassaï, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, their embrace of abstraction a kind of compliment to their more traditional documentary work. Their often stark monochrome photographs are contrasted with the formalist paintings of Braque and Kandinsky as well as the shiny curves of a gold Brancusi sculpture, Maiastra (1911), which Steichen must surely have been aware of when he made his oddly mystical study, Bird in Space, 15 years later. It is instructive, too, to see an image from Germaine Krull’s still-undervalued series Métal (1928), a hymn to the angularity and materiality of steel, and to contrast it with the cleaner lines of Margaret Bourke-White’s ground-level view of the NBC Transmission Tower (1934). In a room entitled New Vision, the work of the great self-taught Hungarian modernist, László Moholy-Nagy, inevitably dominates. His painting K VII (1922), a minimalist arrangement of lines and blocks of colour, is echoed in an untitled photograph by him from the same year and, much later, in Mondrian’s supremely ordered arrangement of colour and form, Composition C (No 111) With Red, Yellow, Blue from 1935. Similarly in the following two rooms, the restlessly innovative imagination of Man Ray makes its presence felt. One of his mysterious rayographs from 1922 is an early example of camera-less photography made by placing everyday objects directly on to photosensitised paper and exposing them to light.Both artists cast a long shadow: Moholy-Nagy in his architectural understanding of scale, angle and detail, and his subversion of the same Man Ray in his seemingly instinctive grasp of photography as an essentially surrealist medium, capable of bending the real out of shape in astonishing ways. Bafflingly, though, there is not a trace of one of photography’s great female pioneers, Berenice Abbott, who made formally brilliant architectural photographs of modernist New York as well as pioneering scientific images of great beauty – including what she called her “rayograms-in-motion” – that surely deserved inclusion here.  In a show that tends towards the cerebral, it is a relief to encounter some more tactile nudes by Brassaï and Imogen Cunningham, in which the curves and surfaces of the female body retain a palpable sensuality. Bill Brandt’s distorted female forms, though, seem a little too forced in comparison. All three of the aforementioned artists could have featured in room eight, which is titled Surface and Texture. It begins with three images from Brassaï’s Graffiti series, in which he photographed anonymous carvings and etchings made on the walls of Paris, some recognisably representational, some abstract, all seeming to hark back to older forms of expression such as cave drawings. More intriguing still are Aaron Siskind’s photographs of cracked, peeling paint on weathered surfaces, which possess a tangible sense of materiality and a tonal quality that speaks of time passing and, with it, the slow, inexorable decay of buildings, objects and those who created them.  This is an exhibition that demands a constant attentiveness to detail and, as such, will repay a second or even third visit. The sheer amount of work on display is at times overwhelming and here and there the endless riffs on angular shapes, circles and patterns of light began to blur into a long series of slight variations on a single brilliant idea. In this context, Lewis Baltz’s almost blank minimalism is a much-needed breathing space. His evocation of the banality of postwar suburban American architecture – grey concrete surfaces in small frames – has a social, even political, undertow in that it draws attention in its deadpan way to the spread of these soulless environments. This is the mundane made abstract.  The final room is given over to contemporary abstraction and, perhaps inevitably, reflects the dilemma of current photographic practice in our profligate image culture. Both Maya Rochat and Daisuke Yokota, in their differing ways, subject their images to intense, almost destructive, transformative techniques using chemicals, heat, paint and, in Daisuke’s case, constant rephotographing, reprinting and rescanning. The visceral nature of their approach both degrades and heightens the photographic image and, by extension, the very idea of photography as a recording medium. The end results are images that are, among other things, traces of a process that is akin to improvisational music insofar as it allows, even thrives on, spontaneity and accident.  London-based Antony Cairns produces traces of a different kind, his shadow-images of London at night emanating an almost ghostly atmosphere that is both Ballardian and oddly Victorian. His silver gelatin prints are shown here behind glass plates in a large grid, each one a glimpse of a cityscape, indistinct yet recognisable, familiar yet unknowable. The ghosts of photography’s past haunt these images: the monochrome textures and shadowlands of Strand, Stieglitz, Steichen and Brassaï – the flaneurs and psychogeographers of another time who sensed the medium’s singular possibilities, not just to reflect the real, but to transform it into another kind of abstract art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f2dcdd73ebcc0436b6ee3fa59c9402ff7c931/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f83052e1e4a714521ff753ebe83e96e","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Korean summit, the Bill Cosby verdict, the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and demonstrations in Gaza – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aeef2b8e471635f539ae6edc496e71be2df84d6/17_14_3435_2062/master/3435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3d2978eae424e832f57d6449100209c","title":"experts have their say on sainsburys asda merger","story":"From fears about job losses to a view of two businesses trying to ‘future-proof themselves’Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB:Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like ‘rationalisation’ in the name of ‘efficiency’.

It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since the merger of Morrison and Safeway in 2003 when dozens of stores changed hands.Sainsbury’s takeover of Asda is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups’ stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury’s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”.Coupe said the retail landscape had changed dramatically since 2003, with more competition from the likes of Amazon, Aldi and Lidl.“Online grocery shopping didn’t exist in 2003 and neither was there the presence of discounters or convenience stores more broadly,” Coupe said. The CMA confirmed on Monday that the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury’s said it had asked the regulator to skip straight to the “phase two” detailed stage of investigation.Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the benefits for customers, which would include lower prices and more choice about how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least £500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers. Putting Argos outlets into Asda stores is expected to bring about £75m of those benefits.Unions have expressed concerns about potential job cuts. But Coupe said jobs would be created and Asda would continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be current boss Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury’s.Sainsbury’s said the board of the combined group would be headed by its chairman. But the supermarket confirmed separately that it had begun a hunt to replace its current chairman, David Tyler, who has been in post for eight years.Coupe said the merger would “create a business that is more dynamic, more adaptable, more resilient and an even bigger contributor to the UK economy”. “Having worked at Asda before Sainsbury’s,” he added, “I understand the culture and the businesses well and believe they are the best possible fit. This creates a great deal for customers, colleagues, suppliers and shareholders and I am excited about the opportunities ahead and what we can achieve together.” He insisted that the Sainsbury’s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices.The deal will be seen as a way for Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market where it is struggling to compete with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain which controls almost a third of the grocery market.But in a statement issued on Monday morning, Sainsbury’s said Walmart would remain a long-term shareholder in the combined group with two representatives on its board. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: “We believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.”She said Walmart was interested in expanding Sainsbury’s Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dd35957e14eb3c104c3780084f90e6655b8d48/0_0_900_1161/master/900.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=44e0bf1f32d3f443ba02cc104243f1ed 1400w","title":"a comedian is being held to higher standards than the president","story":"Comparing Michelle Wolf’s speech to what Trump gets away with is satisfying but it is ultimately empty calories "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18c12dcaa9fa7489f53956fe08cf42ce996e8b6/0_397_1534_920/master/1534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d29a74f5b886797a7954ee33eccb0f7","title":"amber rudd departure toxic policy windrush generation home secretary david lammy","story":"The campaign for justice on behalf of the Windrush generation is not just about political scalps. It is about a burning injustice that stretches from 10 Downing Street into the lives of thousands of British citizens. At its heart the Windrush crisis is about an immigration policy that was allowed to – even designed to – dehumanise, demonise and victimise British citizens.It is right that Amber Rudd has gone. She had lost control of what was going on in the Home Office and lost the confidence of her own civil servants.But the real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place, and her resignation must not distract from this fact. Each Windrush story is the hostile environment policy personified and writ large. Each case is directly linked to a policy that ignores the principle of habeas corpus by imprisoning innocent people without reference to a judge, jury or evidence of guilt. It is this policy that barred British citizens from accessing the public services and benefits that they themselves built with their own hands, staffed and paid for. It is this policy that turned employers, doctors, landlords and social workers into border guards.Described from the outset by its architect and champion, our current prime minister Theresa May, as “deport first, appeal later”, the hostile environment was aided and abetted by a hateful dog-whistle emanating from our tabloid press, reinforced by government ministers and politicians too craven to speak the truth about immigration, too weak and cowed to stand up for the rights of minorities.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Toxic, anti-immigrant rhetoric created the demand for the hostile environment and then served to reinforce policies that addressed largely non-existent problems, pandered to the basest of prejudices and cowardly blamed immigrants for the failures of successive governments. As I previously said in the House of Commons, when you lay down with dogs you get fleas, and this government is in need of fumigation.\u0026nbspThere has been a desperate attempt on the right to separate race from immigration. But they are inseparable. The same prime minister who established a race disparity audit to reveal “difficult truths” also gave us the hostile environment. It is no coincidence that ministers and Whitehall mandarins in a government that failed to recruit a single black Caribbean person on to the civil service fast-stream programme last year saw black British citizens with Caribbean heritage as low-hanging fruit and easy targets.When the 2014 immigration bill passed through the House of Commons for its second reading, I described it as a stain on all that we have achieved as a democracy, ignorant of our history as a nation and harking back to the period when my father arrived in this country as a Windrush citizen to be met by “No Irish, no blacks, no dogs” signs. It is a tragedy that so many British citizens have had to suffer at the hands of this government before they took notice.In an effort to change the subject, cabinet ministers have been touring the studios trying to conflate the treatment of British citizens at the hands of their government with the issue of illegal immigration. Not only is this completely wrong and demonstrative of a worrying lack of understanding of the law, it is frankly insulting to those citizens who have been treated like criminals in their own country.This is symptomatic of how the hostile environment operates. It blurs the lines, and raises questions about the status of Commonwealth British citizens, refugees and asylum seekers so that anybody who looks as though they could conceivably be an illegal immigrant is seen as such.Let’s not let government ministers change the subject to illegal immigration. At root the hostile environment is a policy rooted in pernicious cruelty designed to make life so difficult for people who are here legally that they simply give up and, as suggested by Theresa May’s vans, “go home”.I see the human impact of the policy every week in my constituency surgery. Tottenham has long been proud of its history as an open, erse and multi-ethnic community so it was inevitable the hostile environment would flex its muscles there. Asylum seekers are banned from working, denied access to legal aid and unable to claim benefits so they seek legal support from a migrant support centre and sustenance from a soup kitchen run by a local church – both of which are in turn raided by Home Office enforcement.A minister falling on their sword is usually an attempt to draw a line under a scandal and encourage the media to move on. But the person sat in the hot seat at the Home Office makes no difference to the thousands of people suffering as a result of the hostile environment policy. An unjust law is no law at all. The Windrush generation will not get justice until it is the law that is changed, not just the home secretary.\u0026nbsp• David Lammy is Labour MP for Tottenham and the former minister for higher education"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9308dfe06e2415da764a1896e4c628dabf37e124/0_0_1200_800/master/1200.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5fd5497d367959d6261451f7420c379 700w","title":"time for a riot how the art of 1968 caught a world in turmoil","story":"It was the year hippy idealism gave way to riot and struggle – with protests in Paris, tanks in Prague and black power in the US.  writers pick the pivotal works from that tumultuous timeOn 19 August 1968, Josef Koudelka returned to Czechoslovakia from Romania, where he had been living among and photographing Romany Gypsies. The following day, Soviet tanks appeared on the streets of Prague. For seven days, the 30-year-old Moravian-born photographer roamed the city with his East German Exakta Varex camera loaded with movie film, the only stock he could find at short notice.The resulting images, some of which were smuggled out of the country, but many of which were not seen until decades later, captured the tumult of a traumatised city. They are recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century.Koudelka photographed teenagers blocking the paths of Soviet tanks, old people imploring the young Soviet soldiers to return home, flag-waving youths clambering over army vehicles. He returned to his apartment only to find more film or succumb to exhaustion. His images of defiance have, in the interim, become infused with a romantic, even elegiac quality. Their atmosphere is echoed in photographs of more recent upheavals, most notably the Arab Spring protests.This image, which he titled Hand and Wristwatch, is of a different order: a singular moment of calm and stillness. Here, there is no movement, no noise, only the almost empty street and that anonymous arm in the foreground, stretching out into the frame. It captures not just the moment the troops entered Prague but also the eerie atmosphere of an entire city and country helplessly losing its sense of itself.Look closely and you can see a small group of people who have left their work to gather on the pavement. In the background, those blurry vehicles may be tanks. Everything is uncertain here except the hand of a passerby, curled into a fist, and the hands of the watch that signal the moment when everything changed utterly for the citizens of the invaded city. This may be Koudelka’s only conceptual photograph, but it resonates as an iconic image of a tumultuous political moment in which there is no tumult – only an eerie silence in which time itself seems to have come to a halt. Sean O’Hagan The events of 1968 took some time to percolate through pop: it wasn’t until a year later that Thunderclap Newman would reach No 1 with a song urging the listener to “hand out the arms and ammo … because the revolution’s here”, and that a mood of increasing militancy would really start being reflected by black artists. Of the musicians who did react quickly to 1968’s tumult, the Rolling Stones were audibly re-energised and the Beatles baffled – “you can count me out … in,” sang John Lennon on Revolution. The most incendiary music made in immediate response to the year’s events, a recording of Nina Simone performing at the Westbury Music Fair three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination, was bowdlerised before being released, not least to remove the sound of Simone urging the audience to avenge King’s death by any means: “I ain’t about to be non-violent, honey.”Meanwhile, released in September 1968 – in the aftermath of the Miami riots and the Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago – Jefferson Airplane’s The House at Pooneil Corners offers the sound of hippy idealism curdling into something infinitely darker. It opens with scraping guitar noise, before an ominous, lumbering two-chord riff strikes up. The lyrics bemoan both “all the bullshit around us” and the counterculture’s desire to “get balled and high”: “You say it’s healing, but nobody’s feeling it … you say you don’t see and you don’t”. After two minutes, in lieu of the usual guitar solo, there’s a lengthy electronic wail that sounds like a siren, and the tone is increasingly apocalyptic: “There will be no survivors, my friend”.By the song’s conclusion, the lyrics are positing that a post-human world where “all the idiots have left” will be a kind of naive pastoral utopia replete with cows and turtle doves, but the music tells a different story: it just grinds relentlessly on and on, with more siren-like feedback, more keening guitars. It’s effective because it feels like an honest reaction to the events of 1968: not a strident call for revolution, nor a glib attempt to assure listeners that it’s going to be all right, but the sound of people clearly shaken and confused: peering, terrified, into the void. Alexis PetridisOn 22 November 1968, Star Trek boldly went where no primetime programme had gone before when it aired the first scripted interracial kiss on American TV, in an episode entitled Plato’s Stepchildren. It was not, it should be said, the most romantic of embraces Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) are forced into it by evil aliens with telekinetic powers. Thanks to some artful camera angles you don’t actually see their lips touch and the moment is very brief.But while the kiss may only have lasted a second, it represented decades of progress in regard to race relations in the States. It aired towards the end of the civil rights movement, after several hard-won legal milestones made African Americans slightly more equal under the law. In 1954, segregation was made illegal in public schools. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. In 1967, Loving v Virginia made anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional and rendered interracial marriage legal across the US. In April 1968, days after Martin Luther King was assassinated, the Fair Housing Act was passed, preventing housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion.It would be nice to say that Kirk and Uhura’s kiss represented a turning point in the US. That the revolution had, indeed, been televised and centuries of racial injustice were over, sealed with a kiss. However, 50 years later, depressingly little has changed. US public schools are more segregated now than they were during the civil rights movement, according to a 2013 report. And, that same year, a Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family generated so much racist abuse it made headlines.“Where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference,” Kirk told one of the evil aliens in Plato’s Stepchildren. That’s certainly not true now. Let’s hope things change sometime before the 2360s. Arwa MahdawiLandmark shows don’t have to be masterpieces. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi is a piece of anarchic juvenilia but its Paris premiere in 1896 is accepted as the starting point of the theatre of the absurd. Similarly there may be better musicals than Hair but its opening at Shaftesbury theatre in London on 27 September 1968 (having been seen earlier that year on Broadway) was a political event for two closely connected reasons. The show not only built a popular musical out of protest. It was also the first production to capitalise on the abolition of theatrical censorship which had constricted the British stage since 1737.In those far-off days, all works had to be licensed for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, one of whose readers, in proposing a ban, reported of Hair: “It extols dirt, anti-Establishment views, homosexuality, free love, drug-taking and it inveighs against patriotism.” Actually, that’s a pretty accurate description of a show in which Claude, the son of uptight American parents, rejects the world of work and military induction to join a hippie tribe. Ultimately unable to dodge the draft, he ends up uniformed, hair-shorn and dead. The critic and director Charles Marowitz got it right when he wrote of Hair: “It is the most powerful piece of anti-war propaganda yet to come out of America. Without Vietnam and the American repugnance to that war, the show would never have come into being.”In Britain, there was a good deal of prurient interest in the show’s brief flash of nudity. But that was much less important than its rejection of the death-dealing values of the military-industrial complex and its celebration of life. Hair may have been prompted by anti-war feeling but the book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and the music by Galt MacDermot are joyous rather than jaded. The opening and closing choruses of Aquarius and Let the Sunshine In ring with jubilation. The best moment comes when Hamlet’s “what a piece of work is a man” is turned into an affirmative song for three voices.From today’s perspective, the show’s faith in flower power and chemical experiments may seem naive but no piece of theatre better captures the political mood of the late 60s than this “tribal, love-rock musical”. Michael Billington In 1970 the American choreographer Yvonne Rainer staged an elegant anti-war version of her signature work, Trio A, during which her dancers performed naked with just the United States flag draped ironically around their necks. Rainer’s protest against US involvement in Vietnam would be followed, over the next decade, by a spate of politically conscious dance-making on both sides of the Atlantic. But at the start of 1968, militant acts of choreography tended to focus on the artform itself, re-evaluating the language and conventions of dance.Many of those militants were former students of Merce Cunningham, who was dedicated to the possibilities of pure movement. Cunningham was, in theory, the least political of choreographers. Yet he was always intensely alive to the world outside his studio, and RainForest, created in the spring of 1968, remains a prime example of how dance can become so porous to the zeitgeist that it becomes expressive, even prophetic of history.Much about the work is evocative of its title. David Tudor’s semi-improvised score is a dark forest of buzzing, squawking sound there’s a feral strangeness to many of the dancers’ movements as they crouch, stretch and stalk the stage and overhead the silver balloons of Andy Warhol’s set design cluster like a canopy of light reflecting leaves. It’s those balloons that take RainForest out of its exotic habitat into the unruly party spirit of the late 60s. Some of them are free-floating, so they bob around the stage whenever the performers happen to nudge or brush against them some even fly into the audience. In RainForest there’s a spirit of transformative anarchy at work that not only liberates its dancers from the ordinary rules of human engagement but from the normal constraints of performance. No showing of the work can ever be the same: the sheer chanciness of its construction makes it an embodiment of perpetual possibility and change. Judith Mackrell If any one movie is saturated with the political spirit of 1968, it has to be Jean-Luc Godard’s bizarre, wayward, instructive documentary about the Rolling Stones, entitled One Plus One and later recut and released in a more commercial version (which Godard angrily disowned) named Sympathy for the Devil, in honour of the famous track from the album Beggars Banquet that the Stones are shown recording. When the London film festival attempted to show this version, Godard denounced it from the stage and stalked out, punching the producer on the way.The film is a time capsule. Break it open and an overpowering and unwholesome fume of radical chic and 1968-ness rises from it: fascinating, infuriating. Godard himself became the charismatic face of radicalism that year in March 1968 he led – along with François Truffaut – the anti-Gaullist demonstrations in Paris against the sacking of the Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois which ended in scuffles with the police, Godard’s glasses being smashed, and a combustible situation that materially led to the greater disturbances of May.That summer, he went to London and made his One Plus One: long, unedited real-time sequences of the Stones rehearsing and recording in the studio. No rows or disruptions, though at one stage poor old Charlie Watts gets it in the neck from Mick for his drumming sounding “a bit dead”. But these shots are interspersed and juxtaposed with other sequences: a group of Black Panthers hang out in a junkyard, reading revolutionary texts, passing around weapons and stagily humiliating various submissive women. (The casual misogyny of the era is on display).Godard’s wife Anne Wiazemsky, named “Eve Democracy”, is shown drifting through woodland, laconically answering yes or no to questions from a camera crew. (“Do you think the lower classes have more sexual vitality than the upper classes?” Answer: yes.) A lone figure is shown spraying graffiti in her room at the Park Lane Hilton and then around the streets of London, shown in all their social-realist bleakness: slogans like CINEMARXISM and SOVIETCONG. A weird voice reads from political, pulp and pornographic novels. In a comic book store people give each other Nazi salutes.And what of the Stones? Before the last scene, Godard flashes up the famous graffiti slogan: “Beneath the stones, the beach” punningly hinting that the Stones have the real spirit of 68. But his invocation of the Black Panthers is also a coded denunciation of their appropriating black music. The poses that Godard strikes in this film, and the longueurs between them, are exasperating, though like so many Godard films, this one now shows – I believe – his affinity with conceptual art, as much as cinema. It also shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!In a rare interview conducted five months ago, Sunderland’s in-no-way delusional absentee American owner, Ellis Short, told the club’s website his team should be “trying to finish in seventh place in the Premier League every season”. It was big talk slightly undermined by the fact that, at the time, Sunderland were well on the way to sliding into League One. Now a second successive relegation has been confirmed, only the most optimistic Mackem would suggest deposing Burnley as the Premier League’s surprise package is anything more than a pipe dream. But if Sunderland are to begin the painstaking process of restoring their dignity and once lofty status as top-flight relegation contenders, they will have to do so without the patronage of a man whose stewardship on Wearside has been so disastrously inept, one can’t help but wonder how he was ever successful enough in business to afford to buy the club in the first place.On Sunday it was announced that Short had agreed to sell the club and – as a final gesture of goodwill, or possibly foolishness – would clear the massive debts it had run up during a period when it should have been almost impossible not to make money while sucking at the TV teat. The new owners, a consortium nobody seems to know a great deal about, is fronted by Stewart Donald, a 43-year-old, lifelong Oxford fan, who made his money in insurance and for the time being remains the owner of non-league Eastleigh, which he has now put up for sale.While Donald’s proposed takeover, which remains subject to EFL ratification, was widely celebrated on Wearside by those few remaining Sunderland fans who can remember how to clap and cheer, it did spell bad news for Chris Coleman, the latest boss to be dismissed by Short, an employer he’d never met or even spoken to since wrapping his hands around one of football’s most poisoned chalices. Now debt-free, looking for their ninth manager in six years and with £34m in parachute payments coming down the pipe, it might be an exaggeration to say Sunderland look an attractive proposition, but if they cropped up on Tinder your thumb might at least hover briefly before swiping left.With Cookie crumbled, the search is now on in earnest for yet another manager to steady the ship ahead of next season’s League One campaign. Mick McCarthy has emerged as an early candidate, having said earlier this season that he’d “go back in a heartbeat because I loved my time there”.

When Tottenham Hotspur move into their 62,062-seat stadium next season, the club will enter a new era of financial power. “It would be the time to say: ‘Now, we will win the title,’” the manager said in December. The theory has been that the stadium’s increased revenues will help the club to attract and keep the A-list players.The view has sat uncomfortably with the cost of construction. It seems a long time ago that £400m was the ballpark figure. Then, it became £750m and £850m, and now, nobody would be surprised if it reached a billion. Tottenham have taken out £400m in bank loans, which are repayable over a five-year period. This month they announced in their financial results for the year ended 30 June 2017 that the “cumulative spend” on the project had increased from £115.3m to £315.1m. The club’s profits were robust. They stood at £41.2m after interest and tax. But whichever way you dress it up, there is a lot of money to find. It is no wonder chairman Daniel Levy “struggles to sleep at night”, according to Pochettino.The penny – or great mountains of them – appears to have dropped with Pochettino and when he addressed the press, before Monday’s game against Watford at Wembley, there was a shift in his stance.“The move to the new stadium is not suddenly going to change everything and millions of pounds will rain from the sky,” Pochettino said. “You have to manage and know exactly the expectations. It will be important to review and set the principles again how it will be with the team once we move.”Pochettino’s comments felt significant, just like the ones he made after the FA Cup semi defeat against Manchester United. In four post-match interviews he used the same phrase. The club needed more time to achieve success, he said, and it would be “with me or another” manager.Pochettino was asked for clarification and explained Tottenham’s project was fixed so strongly for the long term it was inevitable another manager would one day take over the responsibility. His contract runs for a further three years. The project is designed for many more.It remains difficult to escape the impression that Pochettino is approaching a crossroads. He has urged Levy on more than one occasion to move quickly in this summer’s transfer market while he ignored a question about whether he would lead the club into the new stadium and, instead, answered one of his own – the classic politician’s trick. “If I stay here for three more years, the project will not change,” Pochettino said. “We cannot change because the club cannot change. Whether it is me or another, that is the right project to keep pushing.The supporters’ fear is that Pochettino will be prised away. The good news for them is that PSG are likely to replace Unai Emery with Thomas Tuchel while Real Madrid will surely not dispense with Zinedine Zidane if, as expected, he takes them to a third successive Champions League final.But Pochettino has seen the future at Tottenham with clarity. The new stadium will change little for him. His transfer dealings since his arrival in the summer of 2014 have shown a net spend on permanent fees of £40.25m – a remarkably low figure – and he will continue to have to sell in order to buy to keep the books balanced.Meanwhile the Manchester clubs, in particular, will carry on splurging. At what point does that get to Pochettino – a manager whose stated ambition is to win the Premier League title?Tottenham remain in a curiously hemmed-in position with regard to strengthening the squad. Last summer they sold Kyle Walker to Manchester City for an initial £50m to fund purchases that would make the collective stronger and this time they are expected to do something similar. Toby Alderweireld is for sale while they would listen to offers for Danny Rose and, surprisingly, Mousa Dembélé.However, the incoming signings would have to fit into Levy’s wage structure, which is capped at a basic £100,000 a week, although not for him. He earned £6m, including bonuses, equating to £115,000 a week, in the year covered by the most recent accounts.It will be difficult to find too many players who would improve Pochettino’s best XI and be happy to sign for, say, £60,000 to £70,000 a week, which is the threshold for many of his starters.One example is Wilfried Zaha, who earns more than £120,000 a week at Crystal Palace. A deal for the winger would be complicated on many levels, not least in terms of the impact it would have on existing squad harmony, which Pochettino has fostered expertly.Will Levy raise the wage ceiling? Yes, although not to market rates. In other words, the club’s stars could get more elsewhere, if they could get out – which is a big if under Levy.Are Tottenham stronger without Walker or, indeed, Alderweireld, who has been marginalised? One thing can be said for certain and it is that the club’s players have noted with interest how Walker has trebled his salary at City and won the title. Could they do one or both at Tottenham? For Pochettino, the balancing act does not get any easier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3350f57d453314a4358a7f38e5361d5228ec753b/139_71_2294_1377/master/2294.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a31585cb998003e5a886bf89c4f24e5","title":"boxes baggies celtic sunderland and more football weekly podcast","story":"Max and the gang talk Wenger’s Old Trafford tribute, trophies for Celtic and Barcelona, Sunderland’s latest woes and podders as Premier League managersRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Along with Fortnite, Evoland 2, Trick Shot 2 and more new mobile games to tryThe first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel.A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself.Oddmar sounds like a standard action game about a Viking hero searching for his lost village while ridding the local forest of critters. What sets it apart is the sheer craft that’s gone into it, from its super-smooth animation as Oddmar leaps through the 24 beautiful (and visually varied) levels to its finely honed touch controls – often an Achilles heel for this genre on mobile. You can breeze through in a matter of hours, but the challenges on each level – from collecting coins to finishing as quickly as possible – give you more for your money.Building on the crafting’n’survival principles that Minecraft popularised and countless other games have refined and experimented with, The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands has you building a settlement in a snowy wasteland by day, then protecting it from monster attacks by night. This day-night cycle gives the game an enthralling rhythm, as you unlock new buildings to craft and uncover more of its story (which, although it falls into the “mysterious ancient civilisations” trope, isn’t too stale).Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops.2015’s Trick Shot was a slow-burning hit: a set of minimalist physics puzzles created by one of the designers of Monument Valley. This sequel keeps the stripped-down “get the ball in the box” idea, with a think-test-repeat dynamic to making best use of the buttons, teleporters, levers and other items. The inclusion of a level editor is heartening too. The majority of players may not have the patience to create their own puzzles, but the ones that do can share them with the community – which should ensure a steady supply of new trick shots to master.“A dark world plagued by beasts and demons” is a setup we’ve seen before, but never quite in this context. Keep in Mind’s hero is Jonas, whose own darkness encompasses alcoholism and depression. His night-time “mirror” world is the key to confronting his issues. The developer created the game for playersfacing their own mental-health issues, and it deserves a wide audience. The exploration and monster interactions are relatively simple, but the message stays with you long after you’ve completed it.One of the first big App Store hits in 2008 was a novelty app to pour a virtual pint. 10 years later, we have games about brewing craft beer. This sits in an accessible spot between full business simulation and mobile-friendly “clicker” game, with a smooth path from your first brew to a thriving business. It’s impossible not to be enjoyably sidetracked by the game’s label-designer section, welding decals, shapes and lettering together for your own ugly-beautiful beer labels.Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience.If you ’re familiar with Final Fantasy XV, it’s unlikely you’ll want to play it on a phone, but this edition is an excellent introduction for everyone else. It is a unique and endearing mix of road trip and Japanese fantasy, starring a boyband-esque group of friends who spend as much time tooling around in an open-topped sports car as they do battling monsters. It’s simplified well for touchscreens: the characters fight for themselves, with you influencing the action through well-timed taps to dodge, block and use special attacks. Final Fantasy is an acquired taste, but try the first episode for free to see if you like it. The next two cost 99p each, and the final seven cost £3.99 apiece.The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic.Kitty Powers is the drag alter ego of games developer Richard Franke and the star of 2014’s Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker, which saw her (and you) matching cartoon clients for a dating agency. This sequel is about those successfully matched couples, who are now falling in love – and you are a God-like figure in charge of their town. Getting up and running takes a while, but you’ll soon be learning your villagers’ likes and dislikes and enthusiastically barging in on their romantic lives. It’s a nice twist on Sims-style, life-management genre.This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming.More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler which will likely have you missing your train or bus stop, such is its one-more-go factor.“You control the level, not the character” isn’t an original twist, but in the right hands it can be inventive, as developer Alike Studio proves here. Your job is to guide alien hero Polo through a host of platform levels to find his kidnapped pet. Swipe vertical sections of the level up or down to swap in different obstacles and items before sending Polo through to see how he fares. It’s a cross between a game and a children’s mix-and-match book: pretty tough, but rarely frustrating. Already popular on consoles, Death Squared has you sliding two miniature robots through more than 80 levels, manipulating mechanisms and avoiding triggering traps to ensure both reach their end markers. You can play alone but Death Squared’s main appeal is as a co-op game for two players, each controlling a robot with gestures on one half of the screen. It’s less fiddly on an iPad, and one of the better family games of 2018, even though it wasn’t especially designed for children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef3bf3139cf9f41d2237cb76a61783a4aa22255/0_0_3555_2133/master/3555.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d3e245fed5c8981dbf2bdb98c2549a","title":"older people disabilities poor health aid study","story":"The older you get, the less likely you are to get lifesaving help in a crisis, says report, and people with disabilities are worst affected Millions of older people with disabilities are at risk of missing out on crucial humanitarian assistance because of physical barriers or discrimination, research suggests.Up to 14 million older people with disabilities are affected by crises globally, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and HelpAge International. It found that organisations often require people to collect aid or social protection payments in person, which is impossible for those who cannot travel long distances to get to distribution points. Older people with disabilities had also encountered hostile attitudes when trying to access support.The study was based on interviews with older people affected by crises in Tanzania and Ukraine, as well as a review of academic research. In Ukraine, some were made to feel humiliated by health and social security staff, while in Tanzania, interviewees reported that they had been accused by younger people of faking their disability in order to get money. Interviewees told researchers they felt forgotten about because of their age.The report warned that disabled older people faced a range of threats in crisis settings, including being less able to escape dangers posed by conflict or natural disasters. One interviewee, now living in Tanzania, told researchers that she had stayed in a hole for three days without any food or drinking water, to hide from conflict in Burundi.Older people with disabilities were also at a greater risk of poverty, more likely to be affected by barriers to healthcare, such as a shortage of medicines, and more likely to be living in inadequate housing conditions. Interviewees described having a lack of dignity, living in overcrowded homes with inaccessible toilets, and being socially isolated. Such challenges, on top of prolonged exposure to conflict and insecurity, all contributed towards worsening mental health.The report recommended greater use of home visits, the distribution of fuel or transport subsidies, and suggested that older people with disabilities should be given priority at food distribution sites. Age International is also calling for donors, policymakers and humanitarian responders to adopt the humanitarian inclusion standards for older people and people with disabilities, a set of principles developed by a group of charities and donors. “The UK’s Department for International Development has pledged to put disability at the heart of its work, and this research shows a clear and urgent need for more to be done to ensure that older people with disabilities get the support they desperately need and deserve in emergencies,” said Chris Roles, managing director of Age International. The research calls on donors, policymakers and aid agencies to support older people’s associations and disabled people’s organisations to work together, and improve aid workers’ understanding of the risks facing older people with disabilities. It also suggests more money should be invested in tackling age and disability discrimination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad098396d20783c168a7242de07d2175f8f7da70/58_1074_2899_1739/master/2899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576e47d7496dfd6f32ffa641036a4cbc","title":"jamie oliver criticism affect me childhood obesity","story":"From school dinners to sugar, the chef’s campaigns provoke strong reactions – but he won’t give up. Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0f85cc3123b23ac4773b2fb9132ac9b8176b6/0_125_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04a1a904aca319f387ac97d28381d6f","title":"how to make new friends adult lonely leap of faith","story":"Striking up friendships can be tricky – and studies show millions of us are lonely. Here, four people who forged new connections explain how they did it. Plus: psychologist Linda Blair gives her tipsWhen you are a child in the playground it is pretty simple, but “Do you want to be my friend?” isn’t a line you hear from adults. Teenage years are filled with friendships easily made (and some easily forgotten), when you are feeling keen, sociable and energetic. Then there are engagements, marriage, relocation, career changes, families: life comes calling with its multiple demands, and friendships evolve as a result. I have been happy to see my friends move through these huge life moments, but as much as I value my friendships, I have found myself lonely at times. Some friends are physically far away, while others are time-poor and, with the best will in the world, it isn’t simple to see each other as often as we would like.According to a recent study by the Red Cross in partnership with Co-op, more than nine million adults in the UK are often or always lonely. We are facing a loneliness epidemic, with Theresa May taking the step earlier this year of appointing Tracey Crouch as what some have dubbed the “minister for loneliness” to try to tackle the issue.Loneliness is something we all feel at times and to varying degrees, but it can also be something that we feel uneasy about admitting to.Still, making friends as an adult can be hard, and takes time – last week a study from the University of Kansas found that two people need to spend 90 hours together to become friends, or 200 hours to qualify as close friends.Clinical psychologist Linda Blair agrees that this can be difficult to achieve: “Usually the basis of making a friend is a shared experience.” These are often in abundance in our earlier years, but once those easy opportunities are gone, you can forget that the initial basis for a friendship is to have a similar passion or interest. Joining a group or class based on something you really love, or volunteering for something you care about, can be a great first step for finding friendships, she advises.Although it can be tricky and nerve-racking, making new friends as an adult can also be rewarding: a message Jacqueline Thomas, 52, is keen to share. Moving to the Warwickshire village of Bulkington in 2015 with her partner David, who is soon to retire, she relished the opportunity to start anew.“We’ve had to start from scratch because we didn’t know anybody here. Our kids have grown up, so we were looking at a slightly quieter life, but it’s actually turned out to be busier than before,” she says.Jacqueline started by introducing herself to her neighbours. She credits signing up to a variety of classes and groups at the village hall as the catalyst for her new friendships. She joined the WI hesitantly, worried it would be “all jam and Jerusalem, and I’d be the youngest person there”. But she now says it was one of the best decisions of her life.Don’t be afraid to try something new, she stresses. A lifelong wheelchair user, Jacqueline was intrigued by a poster in the village hall advertising an adapted martial arts class. Having gone along with some doubts, she was surprised to find how much she enjoyed it. Encouraged by her teacher, Carl Hodgetts, who in 2006 became the first wheelchair-using kickboxing instructor in the UK, she now proudly holds a white belt in Shiying Do adapted martial art. “It just takes one leap of faith. Even if you’re absolutely terrified, do it,” she says, adding: “Even I’m a bit shocked about the martial arts, though.”Over the past couple of years, and nearing 30, I made a conscious effort to make friends. Not to replace old ones, but to make new connections. Friendships, says Blair, are “like an onion. There’s all these layers of friends and the inner layer are your best friends – you probably only have two or three in your whole life.” You might not gain a new best friend, but finding friends for different interests in your life, at different stages, can be a positive.A personal success story came from a friend’s wedding last summer. Rebecca and I bonded over our rumbling bellies as we awaited the bride’s entrance. It turned out we lived near each other in London and had gone to the same school in Dorset (albeit in different years, which when you’re a child makes a crucial difference). We discussed travel, food and summer plans, but I wasn’t sure our newfound friendship would exist outside the tipsy haze of a wedding celebration. But I had resolved not to let these moments slip away and took her number. Fast forward to a meetup in a bar in central London. I had fretted about what to wear, whether she would recognise me and if there would be awkward silences but we are now firm friends, exploring the capital and taking it in turns to suggest somewhere new.Joining local running and cycling groups has also been a positive step. It is an excellent way to meet people in the area. Pete McLeod, 25, a fellow athletics fan and member of my track and field club, Hercules Wimbledon, agrees. After finishing his master’s at Loughborough University, he moved to Wimbledon for his first job and joined the club to keep fit. Making new friends has been a bonus: “It’s really rewarding. You get to practise something you enjoy but also have the opportunity to meet new people.”Pete made a New Year resolution in 2015 to push himself out of his comfort zone and speak to people more: “The club was a good opportunity to put that into practice … when people aren’t out of breath.” He counts some members of the sprinting group as very good friends now, with the japes and conversations flowing over into tennis matches or walks and coffee at the weekend.It is important to be proactive, says Juliana Nabinger, 42, who moved from Brazil to Chile with her husband and two young children three years ago. “Don’t sit and wait – it won’t happen. You have to actively search for new friends.” Now fluent in Spanish, she says that when she first moved she would use the few words she knew to ask questions while waiting for her children to finish at school, even when she knew the answers: “At first it was difficult because I really started to miss my friends and adult conversation, but the kids kept me busy and, through them, I made friends.”Now, via a Facebook group of English-speaking mums and her Spanish conversations at the school gates, she has a solid group of local and expat friends. “The best thing is, you’re older and you don’t judge people,” she says. The worst? “Sometimes people don’t understand your feelings or choices because they don’t know everything. They only have parts of a puzzle.”Friendships can also come from the most unexpected places. Moving from Eday, a small island in Orkney, with a community of about 140 people, to mainland Orkney, Stephen Walters, 43, and his family went from knowing almost everyone to not knowing anyone socially. His wife, Ronie, started the UK’s most northerly roller derby league, the Orkney ViQueens. Initially, Stephen joined to train as a referee and was the only man there, but he went on to became a coach despite having little previous experience on skates. Within a year he had an abundance of friends of all ages, he says.Roller derby’s ethos of inclusion and equality has been a big attraction for him: “I have bipolar disorder and there are a couple of others with similar issues. You can tell when somebody is not quite their usual self and people generally look out for each other, which is really nice.”Not having been involved much in a sport before, he admits he was concerned it would be difficult at his age, but now urges others to give it a try: “Go out and try some activities you’re interested in and talk to people. If it doesn’t work, try another one.”Embarking on friendships as an adult can be terrifying, exciting, rewarding and challenging. Nothing can replace the special connections you have with those who have known you over the years, but taking that leap of faith Jacqueline mentioned can reinvigorate and get the ball rolling. Before rushing off to her afternoon martial arts class, she imparts some simple but effective advice: when it comes to making friends, “Don’t be afraid of being scared. Do it anyway.”Build your self-confidenceLiking yourself before going off in search of friends is an important step to building healthy relationships. “Think about what you like about yourself. When you’re comfortable with yourself, it shines out of you.”Find something you feel passionate about Join a language class if you love languages or volunteer outdoors if you love nature. “That’s where you’ll find friendships.”Put yourself out there Remember, nothing ventured, nothing gained. “It isn’t that you lose if you meet someone and it doesn’t fit for a friendship. That’s not losing, that’s having tried.” Meet in a neutral place Once you have taken the first step and are moving on to meeting outside the initial environment where you made a connection, chose a neutral public space. This can lessen the pressures that, say, hosting at home can bring, and give you time to focus on each other. “If you want to be popular, ask people about themselves and listen sincerely when they answer. A good listener is rare these days. It is the best passport you could possibly have to friendship.”A common mistake is expecting too much from one person. It is more realistic and healthier to have a variety of friends for different reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/111c7e9dcb8963a7f2162f87836ab83ae6d4dfed/0_0_1301_781/master/1301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8ad205fc4cad6fce5808ce21d477052","title":"our hero first female workhouse guvnor is star of exhibition","story":"Lady Ridding fought for rights of inmates after winning election in which women had no votesIn 1894, a respectable and apparently meek woman did something many contemporaries would have regarded as astonishing, if not deplorable. She stood for election to the district council against two male candidates, including a vicar. When Lady Laura Ridding, wife of a bishop, won an election in which women had no vote, she became the first female  of the local workhouse, Southwell in Nottinghamshire.“She was a remarkable woman, our Laura, and having got herself elected she really was a force for change,” said Jan Overfield Shaw, a community officer at the Victorian workhouse. “She did what none of the male s did: she saw what could really make a difference to the lives of the women here – including better food and proper underwear.“The bishop was much older than her, and he looks a bit dry in official portraits – but he supported her work for women’s rights.”Southwell is one of the best-preserved workhouses in the country and is now owned by the National Trust. Ridding’s photograph, which shows her gazing up at her fiance, has just gone on display among portraits of the suffragists and suffragettes she joined in the campaign for votes for women. The exhibition, created by the National Trust and the National Portrait Gallery, is in the former committee room of the workhouse, where between 1894 and 1905 Ridding worked with the other s.Ridding, an author whose works include three volumes of her husband’s biography, was already a founder member of the National Union of Women Workers, an umbrella organisation for voluntary philanthropy. The exhibition reflects isions at the time. Octavia Hill, the co-founder of the National Trust, wrote to the Times in 1910 saying “a serious loss to our country would arise if women entered political life”.She shares the walls with the Pankhursts Mary Raleigh Richardson, who slashed Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery to publicise the campaign and the actor Ellen Terry, who supported votes for women but wrote: “The Suffragettes are a magnificent lot of women but I think perhaps their ardour carries them away at times.”Ridding, though never a window-smashing militant, would ardently support the campaign after her own small victory in the local election. Newly transcribed diaries show her worrying about small details that could make the everyday life of the inmates wretched or relatively content: the meat she tasted one day was stringy and unpleasant, she noted, and the pudding was “great lumpy suet with treacle”. She repeatedly presses the other s until they approve better quality bedding, takes three old ladies out for a drive, brings the children home to tea, and brings grapes and sits with a dying girl – and when she was shocked to learn the women had no drawers, and no night gowns, she loaned money to the matron to buy material to make them.“The miseries we can’t help there are so sad,” she wrote. “The poor miserable old women in the infirmary who grumble because they are so unhappy and rub each other up, who look on it like a prison, who are in a raw against forgetful relations who clap them in there against their will or by fraud.”“She’s a trooper, our hero,” Overfield Shaw said fondly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2577555a6130b19b567a9d3b3df5e302d55231/184_384_4996_2997/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc526dc8be4c3c37ca2538c64bf9693","title":"disappearing jobs around the world in pictures","story":"Before May Day, AFP’s video and photo teams spoke to men and women around the globe whose jobs are becoming increasingly rare as technology transforms societies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c6cae6bc7eaa1b85bcf23db91d11737a77dae20/0_163_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9145667e6e1a71fefaec25ecd8d78961","title":"daniel antopolsky interview country music chickens townes van zandt","story":"Once just a mysterious figure pictured alongside Townes Van Zandt, the ‘outlaw country’ musician has been holed up writing hundreds of songs on a Bordeaux farm – and they’re only just being heardDaniel Antopolsky wasn’t afraid of drugs. “We had this great psilocybin mushroom that was growing in Athens,” he recalls of his time at the University of Georgia, 50 years ago. He would snort anything, swallow anything, smoke anything, but he was afraid of needles, so he wouldn’t inject anything. That saved his life, he thinks.Back in the early 70s, Antopolsky was a longhair, floating around the fringes of the deep south’s singer-songwriter scene. There’s a famous picture, taken on Guy Clark’s front porch, that shows Townes Van Zandt playing a fiddle, Clark playing guitar, his wife Susanna singing, and on the far right a young man, the only one paying attention to the camera. That’s Antopolsky, the picture taken during a short period in 1972 – “it wasn’t that long, maybe five or six weeks I’m a little fuzzy on memory” – when he was travelling around the US with Van Zandt.When the pair reached Houston, Van Zandt decided to indulge himself. “Townes would always tell me, as he tied the rubber band on his arm, ‘Hold that, Daniel.’ He wasn’t afraid of anything. I would look the other way because I couldn’t stand to see a needle. And then Townes would always say, ‘Don’t worry about me Daniel, I’ll take a little nap.’”On this occasion, Van Zandt’s nap went wrong. “After a couple of hours, he was breathing really hard, and his lips were turning blue. And I didn’t know what to do. I was afraid, I was so afraid. I was afraid that he wasn’t going to wake up. I was afraid that the police were gonna come and find the drugs. I was afraid to go to jail. I went and threw the stuff outside underneath some shrubs. I didn’t know what to do, but you’ve seen it on television when somebody has a hard time breathing: push ’em and then to put the air back in ’em you blow in their mouth. I was doing that, and I don’t know for how long. Finally, he got a little better and they came and got him. And later I drove over to the hospital, and the doctor said, ‘Son, you would have got your friend here a minute later, we couldn’t have saved him.’”After that, Antopolsky fled. He fled Texas and he fled musicians. He first went back to Georgia, to Athens and then to his hometown, Augusta. He fled the US – he and a friend travelled around the world, living the life of the carefree hippy traveller: “I was trying to search for meaning, but the truth is, meaning is all around.” He returned home, then in the mid-80s met a French medical student on placement in Georgia, and ended up marrying her. Since 1989, he and Sylvia and their kids have lived on a farm near Bordeaux, she working as a doctor, he raising chickens and children, and writing hundreds of songs, heard by no one but his family. “It’s a house where the kids could be asleep but I could be upstairs till three or four in the morning writing songs. When I think about it, it’s been everything a songwriter could ever dream of.”Except Antopolsky, pushing 70, is now trying to get those songs heard by others. In the past three years he has released four albums, played at South By Southwest, and is playing his first solo headline show in London at Bush Hall this week. This late-life career has been driven by Jason Ressler, who first became a friend, then heard the songs, then started making a documentary about Antopolsky, then persuaded him to record, and is now his manager.The official line is that Antopolsky is the great lost songwriter of the early days of outlaw country (Ressler’s documentary stokes the idea that Antopolsky is Lefty, the lefthanded guitar player, in Van Zandt’s classic Pancho and Lefty, despite Antopolsky himself having no interest in confirming that notion). If anything, though, Antopolsky’s music puts one in mind of a country Daniel Johnston: there’s the same fragile naivety to it (the fact that his most recent record is called Old Timey, Soulful, Hippy-Dippy, Flower Child Songs from the Cosmos … Wow! might give you some idea of the general tenor of things, as might the song Chickens, from his first album, 2015’s Sweet Lovin’ Music, even more so: “Never had a chicken like sweet Loretta  She was grabbed by a fox in nasty weather,” he sings, amid detailing the character traits of his various fowl). “I’ve got nature songs and funny songs and they sound simple,” Antopolsky says. “But with simple things, deeper things come out sometimes. And they’re not all simple. But it’s like a book. Sometimes the cover doesn’t tell it all but we’re attracted by the cover.”Actually, that’s not all he says at that point. Antopolsky talks in long, rambling paragraphs that veer wildly off topic, punctuated with giggles. The remark about his songs is only a preface: it leads on to him talking about his elephant (“it’s really just a trimmed hedge that was made into an elephant 29 years ago”), how he feels claustrophobic, barbecuing in the Georgia woods as a boy, living in valleys in Hawaii, getting “lungs full with whatever within 12 hours” of being in Tokyo (“I didn’t stay long”) and the merits of Hong Kong’s carless island Cheung Chau. He is a very hard man to keep to the point, and it’s not helped by the fact that he is feeding his chickens and walking around his land as he talks to me by phone. He pauses at one point to try to get a chicken to say “hello” to me.But it’s hard to begrudge him. After all, his has not been an easy life. The fear of needles came from watching his mother, he says: she died when he was 10, and he had been disturbed by years of treatment for Parkinson’s. His father died when he was 17, and though he had older brothers, he was fundamentally on his own. “Not long after that I went off to university,” he says. “I was just wild, with no parents to come home to. Of course, if my father would have seen the hair and the beads, I would have had to answer to him.” He then narrowly avoided the draft, and began the years of itinerant living: “I bought an old Volkswagen van and just hit the road.”Talking to Antopolsky, you get the impression he would gladly have done without taking his music public. When he went to SXSW, his first reaction was to be “petrified … It’s not for me”, though he enjoyed being cheered to the rafters. Recording his first album, Sweet Lovin’ Music, in Nashville was a trial because he wasn’t allowed to simply play his songs with his own accompaniment: “I’d never had those ear things, those headphones, and I had to hear the backup and sing with it, and I’d never sung without a guitar.”So it’s easy to believe him when he says he was happy keeping his hundreds of songs to himself for all these years. “Things ripen,” he says, “and when they ripen, there’s hardly no reason to discuss it. We get ourselves in a lot of trouble when we say, ‘I wish things weren’t this way.’ We’ve got to deal with what’s real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/71_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb43c929806bbd6ffaa84c3d196cc961","title":"fresh lords defeat for government makes no deal less likely","story":"Cross-party amendment, passed with support of 19 Tory rebels, is seventh Lords defeat for government on EU withdrawal billThe government has suffered a heavy defeat on a crucial Lords vote that could pave the way for parliament to send ministers back to the Brussels negotiations if MPs vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Labour said the amendment, which is the seventh Lords defeat for the government on the EU withdrawal bill, would effectively prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal. The cross-party amendment was supported by 19 Tory rebels, winning by a majority of 111.Ministers have previously warned that should parliament vote down the deal agreed by negotiators, Britain would leave the bloc with no agreement. The amendment, led by former Tory minister Douglas Hogg, would change that scenario, meaning parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is designed to enhance Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, guaranteeing MPs a vote on the final deal, which won a shock victory in the Commons in December.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote “a hugely significant moment in the fight to ensure parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no-deal situation.”The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the amendment “puts parliament in the driving seat.”Rebel Tory sources have said they are confident there is cross-party support in the Commons for the plan, giving remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging Brexit deal without the fear that it will trigger a “no deal” outcome where the consequences would be worse.During the debate, Hogg told peers the clause was “designed to ensure that the future of our country is determined by parliament and not by ministers”.He said a choice between accepting the terms or crashing out of the EU would not be a genuine choice. “This is not regaining control. To act in such a manner would be to impose ministerial decisions on parliament by coercion,” he said, calling it “an elective dictatorship of a particularly flagrant kind”.Echoing Margaret Thatcher, under whom he said he was “privileged to serve”, Hogg said his response was: “No, no no!”He called the referendum vote “at the very best an interim decision” and said the public could not have predicted the terms of the UK’s departure.Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts said he was deeply concerned about the sweeping powers of the government, likening to the 1933 Enabling Act conferring absolute power on Adolf Hitler. “Perhaps I’m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible,” he said. However, former Tory leader Michael Howard made a scathing speech about the amendment, saying it could precipitate a constitutional crisis. The House of Commons, he said, was “not a negotiating body, it has never taken that role, I don’t believe it wants that role and I don’t believe it should have that role ... it would immeasurably weaken the government’s negotiating position with the EU and would I believe make our government and our country a laughing stock.”Later in the debate, the Brexit-backing Green party peer Jenny Jones said she had come to the House of Lords prepared to vote for the amendment on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, but said she had been put off by the speeches of pro-remain peers.“Quite honestly, the speeches in favour have turned me against them,” she said. “There is clearly more of an agenda than control of the process.”Speaking after the vote, DExEU minister Lord Callanan said the amendment would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.”Peers will also vote later on a cross-party amendment led by Labour peer John Monks, which would give parliament even greater powers over the Brexit negotiations. The amendment calls on ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase 2 negotiating mandate – similar to the process that exists at the EU level, where leaders of the EU27 approve the mandate of Michel Barnier’s negotiating team.Brexiteers have said it fundamentally undermines the government. Writing for the Sun, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical – because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.“Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give parliament the power to micromanage the government on how to carry out these negotiations.”Davis said the change would give the EU commission “a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50bf890d25ebe73a127570c8fba29b4fe839e77b/0_0_5146_3089/master/5146.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64677920bbba6bbca6fc9489bcddcfb5","title":"sajid javid tory power stance","story":"On his first day at work, the new home secretary resurrected the tradition of Conservative ministers striking a distinctly odd poseAs he was officially unveiled on his first day at work as home secretary, Sajid Javid struck one familiar chord. Or rather, struck one familiar pose – the rather curious, legs-too-far-apart “power stance”.It has become a habit from leading Conservative politicians, dating back to 2015. George Osborne was the early adopter, photographed here after delivering his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester that year.The spread soon spread. Future prime minister Theresa May took her turn following her speech at the same conference. And then Michael Gove was spotted by  writer Michael Deacon, appearing backstage interviewed by the BBC, in the very same pose.A few months later, then prime minister David Cameron was also doing it – on live TV – for his doomed TV debate attempts to get the country to vote remain in the 2016 referendum.But where does it come from?Back in 2015 the  asked Dr Connson Locke, a leadership and organisational behaviour lecturer at LSE. After she stopped laughing at Osborne’s picture, she told Homa Khaleeli: “All I can think is that he got the advice that you should take up space to demonstrate confidence and he’s taken that to a weird extreme … It doesn’t mean standing with your feet so out of place that you look unnatural.”One possible source is Amy Cuddy. She did a very popular TEDTalk in 2012 that suggested that people adopting “high-power poses” for a couple of minutes a day lead to a measurable difference in how confidently they felt and acted. One of the poses she claimed had this effect is a Lynda Carter Wonder Woman-style pose, very similar to the one that the Tories keep making.With the political demise of Cameron and Osborne in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and May’s determination to put the remain-backing Conservative years behind the party, we thought the Tory power stance had disappeared.Could Javid’s resurrection of the pose be a coded message to backbench remainers?Meanwhile, with the news breaking late on Sunday night that Amber Rudd had resigned following the Windrush revelations, Labour MP David Lammy had a very different power stance in mind on his way to work on Monday morning.A vocal critic of both the prime minister and the ousted home secretary, Lammy used Twitter to suggest he’d entered the Houses of Parliament today with more than a little swagger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608ef3171c15fdb3706e9b9b676b73413a5efccc/0_78_2701_1621/master/2701.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c7d6b89708be06a6cc264f2ab6da71","title":"new beetle species named after leonardo dicaprio","story":"Water beetle species found in Malaysia was named after the Titanic star for his environmental activismA new species of water beetle found clinging to a sandstone rock in a fast-flowing stream that leads to a waterfall in Malaysian Borneo has been named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.The tiny black insect, which has a partially retractable head and slightly protruding eyes, was named after the star of Titanic and The Revenant for his environmental activism.Citizen scientists who took part in an expedition to Borneo’s Maliau Basin recovered the first known specimen of Grouvellinus leonardodicaprioi from a shallow stream about a kilometre above sea level. The 3mm-long beetle was rather battered and lacked a front leg and antenna.The field trip to Borneo was arranged by scientists at Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines and a Dutch firm, Taxon Expeditions, that trains paying members of the public in the scientific techniques used to capture, study and identify new species. The beetle was named after DiCaprio after the citizen scientists and staff at the Maliau Basin Studies Centre voted at a ceremony at the end of the trip.The DiCaprio beetle is only the latest new species to be named after a prominent figure. Earlier this year, a particularly beefy fly from the Brazilian Amazon was named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, while last year the discovery of a moth with yellowish-white scales on its head was named after Donald Trump. Kate Winslet, who starred alongside DiCaprio in Titanic, already has a beetle named after her, as do George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Adolf Hitler.“In this case, we didn’t name the beetle because it looks like Leonardo DiCaprio,” said Iva Njunjić at Taxon Expeditions. “We wanted to highlight that even the smallest creature is important, such as this tiny beetle that nobody knew about before now.” A second new species of water beetle discovered on the same trip was named after the Dutch astronaut André Kuipers, according to a report in the journal ZooKeys.The researchers used a variety of fine-meshed fishing nets and other types of traps to capture insects in the region before preserving them in alcohol. The specimens were taken back to the laboratory to have their DNA sequenced and their bodies examined in fine detail under a microscope. When determining a new species of beetle, it is important to dissect the male genitalia, as these can help distinguish one variety of water beetle from another, said Njunjić. An internal membranous sac in the male is covered with spines, though whether these aid stimulation during sex or have another role is unknown, said Hendrik Freitag, a member of the team. DiCaprio launched an environmental foundation in 1998 to help protect threatened ecosystems around the world. In 2016, he received an award for his work from the UN and in a speech at the ceremony said tackling climate change could be the biggest economic opportunity in US history.It is unclear what DiCaprio makes of his latest honour, which follows his long-awaited win at the Oscars for his role as a 19th-century fur-trapper in the 2015 movie The Revenant. Njunjić said the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation was informed late last week. “They haven’t replied yet,” she said.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eabc48a25897572716803b7e780d29c6c251a43/0_89_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c1bfac09480f9dee88157d20ea5108","title":"woman with aspergers ejected from cinema for laughing at western","story":"Tamsin Parker, 25, was removed for laughing during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in LondonThe British Film Institute has apologised after staff forcibly removed a woman with Asperger syndrome from the cinema in what onlookers described as a “disgusting” sign of “naked intolerance”.Tamsin Parker, 25, an artist and animator, was watching a screening at the BFI’s cinema on London’s South Bank of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, directed by Sergio Leone – with two friends. She was asked to leave for laughing too loudly.Her mother added: “She was completely humiliated and it ruined her birthday.”The BFI released a statement saying it was sorry and had got it wrong in a “challenging and complex situation”.“We are taking this situation extremely seriously and this morning we have been investigating further ... We can and must do better in accommodating all the needs of our customers and we will be addressing what additional provisions and staff training we can put in place,” the institute said.Parker’s mother, who is speaking to a lawyer about what happened, said: “It would be nice to arrange a screening for Tamsin and her friends. The manager did not seem very apologetic at the time.” Parker was eager to see the BFI screening and has watched the film eight times, according to her mother, who went to collect her daughter after she was thrown out. “She was in floods of tears ... she was really scared,” her mother said.Lydia Parker, a theatre director, said it had been heartening to see messages of support on Twitter. The story has been shared widely on social media, with people voicing concern.One cinemagoer, Lloyd Shepherd, expressed his disgust after the incident. “She’d been laughing very loudly, but at moments which were supposed to be funny. Some people complained. She was dragged out shouting: ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s.’ She was incredibly upset,” he said.He said some people applauded her removal while others were upset, with a large number leaving.“I am shaking with anger. That poor, poor woman. Just a little bit of empathy and everything would have been fine. Such naked intolerance. In the middle of London. Disgusting,” Shepherd said.Parker’s sister, Sabrina Parker, tweeted that she had taken her sibling home to watch the rest of the movie. “Thank you for sharing this ... we’re horrified that they would treat her so badly,” she wrote. “Obviously she’s still very upset. It’s her favourite movie and it was her 25th birthday celebration.”The National Autistic Society said many autistic people felt venues were not autism-friendly enough, which is why it runs the autism friendly award to encourage businesses to be more accessible. The charity added that it works with cinemas and theatres to hold autism-friendly screenings.Jane Harris, the NAS’s director of external affairs, said the incident was shocking and a colleague was at the screening, “along with others who were equally distressed by what they had witnessed”.“It’s great to hear that so many audience members were sympathetic, but this incident shows just how far we have to go for autistic people to get the understanding they deserve,” she added.Harris said the NAS would be reaching out to the BFI to discuss ways to improve its staff members’ understanding of autism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d548975e44b067d6715a82120969197f8dd49102/250_543_4026_2417/master/4026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=658833bdb5cd3088be50981097d95a21","title":"garbine muguruza athlete feminine tennis wimbledon interview","story":"“Words like ‘feminine’ and ‘fighter’ can go together,” Garbiñe Muguruza says with charming force on a cold but sun-kissed morning in Madrid. “You can be feminine and you can say, ‘I really want to beat her. But I don’t want to look like a little monster in the corner.’ I want to take this wall down which says you are one thing or the other. If you are a feminine athlete people say: ‘Oh, she wants to be a model or she’s not concentrating.’ No. We are concentrating.”Muguruza, the reigning Wimbledon champion and world No\u0026nbsp3, is a formidable competitor who is proud she beat Serena and Venus Williams in the finals of the two grand slam tournaments she has won so far. In a ridiculously stylish hotel she is also relaxed and refreshingly forthright.“It’s a delicate thing because for some people it’s very hard to allow an athlete to be feminine. For me it’s easy. I want to fight on court but I also want to wear something I like. You can be angry and competitive and a fighter and you can also be nice and wear something by Stella McCartney. I feel good in that and it’s important for your esteem because you’ve got to be resilient. I’m a tennis player, and that’s my priority. I like fashion but I would never want to be a model. I don’t want to forget what I’m good at because as soon as you do you’re screwed.”The 24-year-old Spaniard, who was born in Venezuela, smiles at that blunt truth as the clay court season gathers pace with the Madrid Open starting on Sunday. And when Muguruza tells me about being invited to the Oscars in March, she ensures that the most telling line is one where her concern for ordinary woman is obvious. “I wore black,” she says, in honour of the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment, “but it wasn’t like the Golden Globes where everybody wore black. It’s a problem that was quiet before but it was there all the time. It got more exposure because the women who spoke out are famous and it’s Hollywood. If an Oscar winner speaks about it then it goes everywhere. But if the waitress says this has happened to her nobody really listens.”The impact of that last sentence is powerful – and Muguruza nods calmly. “It’s everywhere.”Muguruza also met Billie Jean King, whose defeat of Bobby Riggs in 1973 has been turned into a Hollywood film. “I want to see it because I heard it’s good,” Muguruza says of Battle of the Sexes, which captures the way King took on Riggs and sexism. “But, usually, when I watch a movie I want to see Fast and Furious or the Expendables. I just want to chill out, turn up the volume and stare at the screen.”She laughs at her terrible taste in movies before acknowledging the debt all female tennis players owe to King and another pioneer for equality in Venus Williams. Women now receive the same pay as men in grand slam tournaments. “I speak to other athletes and they don’t have the impact, the money and equality we have. It’s getting better and better in tennis and hopefully it can soon be completely equal in all tournaments. But in other sports it’s not like that.”Muguruza won £2.2m after beating Venus Williams in the Wimbledon final last year but the tennis circuit, particularly for lower-ranked players, is testing. “Tennis is very lonely,” she stresses, “especially when you are younger and don’t have family around. It can just be you and your coach in China. But everybody is in the same situation. You have to be a young old lady – that’s how I call myself sometimes. You have incredible moments and very bad moments when you are alone. You miss your family but tennis just lasts for a short period. You make sacrifices but I don’t miss having a young life. I’m happy and very privileged.”Four years ago, at the French Open, Muguruza’s full power was revealed for the first time when she gave Serena Williams the worst beating of her illustrious career in the second round. “It was an incredible match nobody was expecting. If you told me before I was going to win 6-2, 6-2 I would be surprised. But I never stopped believing I could beat anybody – even if Serena is one of the best players in history. She was one of the women I watched on TV as a kid.”In 2016 Muguruza won her first grand slam, at Roland Garros, when she again beat Williams in straight sets in the final. “I was nervous because I had made the 2015 Wimbledon final but it only matters that Serena won. Yeah, I played well\u0026nbspbut who cares about the loser? So in the French I was like, ‘I don’t want to lose again.’ I was also motivated because beating a Williams sister has extra value. If you win a grand slam by beating them it feels more important. It was an explosion of happiness.”Last year was much more difficult in Paris when, in the fourth round, she lost against the local favourite Kristina Mladenovic. Muguruza’s errors were cheered and she left the court visibly upset. “The crowd was very involved and with her. It’s normal. But I had tears in the press conference and showed people how athletes feel. Some people were surprised but I’m like: ‘Come on, I’ve been three hours on court and it’s emotional. That’s what everybody does in the locker room but you don’t see them.’ It was good in the end because I expressed myself and showed I am human. The French Open will always be the most special tournament to me. It was my first grand slam and the tournament I wanted to win when I was little.”Winning Wimbledon was thrilling last year. “I was emotional because when I lost to Serena in 2015 I didn’t know if I’d get another chance as grass is unpredictable. So to beat Venus and win it two years later? I was like: ‘Whew!’”Muguruza, who jokes about her serious salsa dancing, was mortified at the Wimbledon dinner. “People had told me, ‘There’s a ball and you can dance.’ I’m like, ‘Oh my God I’m going to dance with Roger Federer? Yes, I’m ready for that.’ Then someone told me there’s not a dance since 1992. ‘What?’”Muguruza opens her eyes in horror before smiling. “A ball for Wimbledon is serious, elegant, classy. You can’t do the conga but I was ready for everything!”She has a chance of winning both the French Open and Wimbledon again this year – because she clearly raises her game in major tournaments. Her recent tour win in Monterrey gave her a sixth WTA title – but there was a time when her four tournament wins included two grand slams. Her inconsistency almost amuses her.Beyond her drive to win the most important titles, Muguruza’s rounded attitude means she has begun to explore her interest in fashion design. “My mum and I always talk about it because her dream was to be a designer. Of course I’m always wearing sports clothes so, even more, I want to wear high heels. I’ve now started to do some designs. I take my tablet when I’m travelling and I look at magazines and make notes. Then I design the way I like.“It’s good to escape because since I was very young everything has been tennis, tennis, tennis. Now I have more perspective and space in my head. I take a few hours to do something fun for myself. It’s healthy. So when the time is right it will be OK for me to close this chapter on tennis. I’ll probably have a family and do something related to fashion.”Her ease in front of the camera is obvious when she slips into the hotel garden for the photo shoot, but Muguruza is fiercely competitive and says: “I also fear the end because tennis is a life. I’m happiest when I win. You enjoy not knowing if you’re going to win and you can love hating the court.”Muguruza, a feminine fighter and a champion, breaks into a helpless smile. “When you shake hands, and think, ‘Yes, I won,’ that’s such a good feeling. All the hours of training feel worth it. So the best moment is when it’s over and you’ve won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204/589_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6c91812e9a67782fce923bee7edeeb","title":"windows 10 april 2018 update microsoft task management cortana edge sharing","story":"Microsoft has released the latest version of Windows 10, adding improvements to task management, Cortana, Edge and sharingThe next version of Windows 10 is finally ready to download as a free update that adds some potentially game-changing new features as well as some welcome features that bring it up to par with what you might expect from a smartphone.Instead of adding tools for people creating media, as the previous two updates have, the latest version of Windows 10 is focused on time and task management.“We want to give you back some of your greatest currency, your time. Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group.That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense.It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community.Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out.The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that.In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release.That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading.The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off.As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS.Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing.Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate.Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking.Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added.Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements.Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8184cb1d1af8ab322c3ccc74f27e198528af8c/0_215_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3650c509a435673372cea6ea993a7d75","title":"sidelined china seeks to maintain influence as ties between north korea and us improve","story":"Improved relations between the former foes could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outsideDuring North and South Korea’s historic summit on Friday, China was notably quiet. Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week.The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside.Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.”While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding.China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474063.1524672769!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thou shalt obey these 24 consumer commandments","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPricewatch reckons a good consumer needs to follow 24 commandments to make sure they get the most out of lifeMoses figured 10 commandments were enough to see the world right while Jesus was able to get it down to just two.

We tend to shop in the same supermarkets and buy clothes in the same places and stick with the same phone, gas, television and broadband providers, come what may.This is understandable but not clever. Make a point of doing your “big shop” in a different supermarket every now and then. Just to shake things up. And if you have not experienced the delights of the German discounters in a while – and less than 30 per cent of Irish consumers shop in either Aldi or Lidl regularly – then give them a whirl.The quality has improved dramatically in recent years and they will save you money. They will also dramatically reduce the time you spend shopping because they are small and have less than 20 per cent of the stock a really big supermarket operated by their rivals has, so you will be able to zip around. And probably buy some class of weird jack hammer to boot.We throw away as much as a third of the food we buy and appear happy to bin hundreds, if not thousands, of euro each year. Stop doing that by making sure you only buy what you need. Make lists and stick to them.Not long ago we heard a terrible story of a person who ended up paying health insurance on the double for a whole year because they thought they had cancelled with one provider and signed up with another only to find out way down the line that the cancellation had not gone through as they thought.When the company they had tried to leave asked them what date they had made the original cancellation call and who they had spoken to they had no idea. No records mean it is always going to be harder to get redress if things go wrong. So if you are interacting with a company and the outcome matters, take a note of the date and time and the people you were speaking to on your phone.If you are making a complaint write a quick timeline of your grievances and include dates and times of phone calls or other conversations. Write down who you spoke to and what was said.People who shop on impulse rarely make the best decisions. Always ask yourself two questions: do you really need this thing? And is this thing really good value for money?And then go away and think about it for a while.Randomly received text messages and Facebook posts promising you free iPads are always nonsense. Expensive creams will not give you the gift of eternal youth, that expensive diet or homeopathic treatment aimed at taking years off you will not work.And the sub-Saharan princess with a case full of diamonds for you is actually a sweaty man in a wife-beater and Y-fronts who will give you nothing more than endless heartache. And if you ever get an unsolicited email from your bank, from Revenue or anyone else asking for your bank details – or even just your name and email address – it is a scam, no matter how convincing the mail looks.Cooking is cheaper and better for your physical and mental well-being than relying on processed food.Cyclists are healthier than drivers. That is a fact. A couple of years ago the Lancet published a report which showed cyclists to be slimmer and likely to live longer than their car-driving counterparts.Looking at biological data from more than 150,000 people and studying the health of half a million others aged between 40 and 69, scientists definitively concluded that getting on your bike was better for you. Another Danish study showed that regular cyclists live for more than five years longer than non-cyclists. And it will also save you thousands of euro in commuting costs while allowing you to feel super-smug.Generally speaking such diets are expensive and worthless – this is particularly true of detox diets which are just nonsense. Don’t trust anyone who tries to sell anything that claims to be detoxifying unless it is a human organ. And you’re probably better off not trusting someone trying to sell you a liver or a kidney either.For all its faults and for all the recent controversies of recent years, we should still be grateful that Ireland has a good supply of good-quality drinking water which comes from our taps free of charge (yes, yes, yes we know we pay for it through general taxation but you know what we mean).It takes three litres of regular water to manufacture a single litre of bottled water, and that plastic bottle will take at least 500 years to break down, at least until those enzymes that have evolved to eat plastic multiply. And let’s just hope they don’t evolve any further and start eating us.If you happen to be among the 70 per cent of Irish people with private health insurance who has not changed provider for a few years do before your next renewal date.It will save you hundreds of euro each year – and you may even save thousands if you happen to be on a really expensive policy. And if you are canny you should be able to make the savings without losing any real benefits.Remember when switching, providers can’t ask intrusive questions about your health. The only thing they can really ask if if you have health insurance already and, if so, for how long and with which insurer and what level of cover you have.As with health insurance providers, gas and electricity companies profit from our lethargy and ignorance. By switching from one charging you the standard rate to one offering a discounted rate you could easily save more than €200 over the next 12 months.As many as 85 per cent of Irish people pay a higher tariff for both electricity and gas than they need to. And unlike Cornflakes or broadband, there is no difference in the quality of the gas or electricity between the dearest and the cheapest.Every now and then set yourself a challenge to spend nothing for just one day. Then see if you can make it three days. Spending can be a habit and it can be broken.And speaking of spending money, never do your grocery shopping while hungry or your online shopping when you are drunk. Don’t routinely carry your credit cards with you. And avoid the temptation to shop on payday. Anyone who goes into Penneys on the day they get paid is bound to leave with an armful of clothes they are almost certainly going to regret buying.Big companies profit from our unwillingness to even open – never mind actually read and try to understand – the bills and statements they send us either virtually or physically. So make a resolution to pay attention to them. You never know when you are being gouged and by whom.Companies have made it a policy to make resolving problems as difficult as possible. The hope is that difficult customers – and by that we mean anyone looking for help or redress – will just go away. If you have a grievance with a company, persist. Don’t just give up if it seems like too much hassle. That’s just playing into their hands.You don’t want to be the person shouting in a shop because it refuses to sell you the flatscreen telly that was incorrectly priced at 1 cent. Retailers are not obliged to sell you a product just because it has a particular price tag on it.And you do not have the automatic right to a refund or a replacement if a product turns out to be faulty or flawed in some way. A provider can instead offer to repair it. Oh and if you pay a deposit for something and then change your mind, do not automatically assume a provider will give you your money back. They might. But they might not. It depends on the terms and conditions.Working as a shop assistant or in a call centre can be incredibly difficult and not very well paid. If you have a grievance, there is little or no point in shouting at the lowest-paid staff member, the very person who has no power to effect change. Always be polite – and always make sure you are addressing your complaints to the right people.Without generalising overly Americans and Germans are great at complaining while Irish people are rubbish. We hate “making a fuss”. Not even Pricewatch is immune and unless a waiter actually spits in our soup before tipping it into our lap we are likely to say everything is grand even if it tastes like cold vomit. But complaining is good and good businesses want to hear our concerns so they can have a chance to address them.Yes Amazon or Asos or the Honk Kong-based electronic’s retailer Dan’s Dodgy Deals might be cheap but what is the ultimate cost? If we all shop online all the time then local retailers will disappear and we will all be the poorer for that.There is no point in mourning the passing of Clerys or Guineys or wherever if the last time you spent any money there was back when Johnny Logan was asking what another year was.Unless you have friends in Senegal or the Democratic Republic of Congo don’t return a missed call from those places. In fact, if you have a missed call from any exotic looking number don’t call back. It’s almost always a scam.We know that sometimes they are longer than the Bible so a handy way to scan them is to copy the whole thing into a Word document and use Ctrl-F to look for key words you think might be relevant.It is easy to complain in a very public way using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever social media platform you are fond of using yourself. But remember to be polite.These platforms are populated with enough trolls already. And when it comes to sharing personal details on such platforms such as the above, mind yourself and limit the amount of information you put into the public domain.Is there an ombudsman or regulator who can help you out? There is a Financial Services Ombudsman, a Pensions Ombudsman, the Central Bank, a taxi regulator and ComReg, for starters. But remember they can rarely be your starting point, and you will have to exhaust the complaints procedure for that sector and deal with the company before they will entertain you.If you have been let down by a shop or service provider than contact Pricewatch – we might be able to help you out. But please remember we do get a lot of queries and complaints and can’t deal with them all."},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

It follows the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u0027s visit on Sunday and a telephone conversation between Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump on Saturday.Mr Trump is due to decide on May 12 whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, putting in peril the 2015 nuclear accord.Mr Pompeo has warned that the United States will withdraw from the agreement if we can\u0027t fix it.The Israeli premier has repeatedly called for the accord between world powers and his country\u0027s main enemy to either be altered or scrapped.He alleges the agreement does not prevent Iran from eventually obtaining nuclear weapons and says the lifting of sanctions has increased Tehran\u0027s ability to finance proxy militants in the Middle East.Most world powers however say the nuclear deal is working as intended for now and is the best way to keep Iran from acquiring the bomb.Israel is also deeply concerned over Iran\u0027s presence in Syria, where it is backing President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime.Mr Netanyahu has pledged to stop Iran from entrenching itself militarily in the neighbouring country.On Monday, a monitor said missile strikes on central Syria killed 26 pro-regime fighters, most of them Iranians, in a raid it said bore the hallmarks of an Israeli operation.Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz told army radio that he was not aware of the strikes.The latest such attacks came amid heightened tensions after Damascus and Tehran accused Israel on April 9 of conducting deadly strikes against a military base in central Syria.Pompeo joined Netanyahu in lashing out at Iran when the two met in Tel Aviv on Sunday.Iran\u0027s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains, Pompeo said.Please review our commenting policyCholera epidemic fears in Somalia and Kenya as severe flooding forces families to flee their homesUK weather: Man dies after being swept off pier as \u0026#39month\u0026#39s worth of rain\u0026#39 and gales batter parts of Britain Plane carrying 200 people lands on wrong, unfinished runwayHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Why surfing 50ft waves is like meditationButcher told by police to take down saucy signs - even though no one complained Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsTop photojournalist among dead as twin Kabul suicide blasts kill at least 25Church of England split over US plan to remove \u0026#39husband and wife\u0026#39 from marriage serviceAntarctic glacier the size of Britain threatens to flood coastal towns Cannes festival refuses to withdraw Terry Gilliam’s Don Quixote film in rights battle with producer Alleged Isil supporter denies sharing details of Prince George\u0026#39s schoolMilitary police to excavate site in Germany in bid to solve 36-year-old case of missing British childWhisky shops in England braced for Scottish booze cruisers as minimum alcohol pricing hits\u0026#39Mind-reading’ tech being used to monitor Chinese workers\u0026#39 emotionsMexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Antiques dealer jailed for life for strangling daughter as wife says he should have killed himself Donald Trump suggests Korean truce village as location for Kim Jong-un summitStonehenge tunnel would spoil the view for drivers, says former National Trust chairman Woman with Asperger\u0026#39s removed from Western film screening for laughing too loudlyReviewed: Virgin\u0026#39s three-tier economy class - gimmick or game-changer?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000028866429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqu-OikvdBRER69p9XrEwjPgoETvvjeK235wnJx6l_Fqk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"whisky shops england braced scottish booze cruisers minimum","story":"The price of whisky could go up by as much as £4 per bottle on some brandsWhisky shops in Berwick and Carlisle are preparing for Scottish drinkers on booze cruises after the introduction of minimum pricing.Industry experts have warned the new rules will mean drinkers may cross the border in search of cheaper alcohol. At midnight tonight, new pricing rules to discourage problem drinking will increase the prices of alcohol in Scotland.Shops in England are already preparing for the surge in Scottish customers by increasing stock of whisky, other spirits and beer.The law will affect lower-end whisky, as it is the less expensive brands which will be hit by the minimum alcohol pricing, with price per unit set at 50p. This means that 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than £14.The House of Malt in Carlisle is hoping to cash in on the minimum alcohol pricing ruling. The shop specialises in high-end whiskys but is expanding its lower-end range for Scots hoping to buy cheap booze.Store manager Mike Little told The  they have bought in more for their blended range, and are putting on deals for those hopping across the border from tomorrow.He said he hopes the minimum pricing rule will boost his business, explaining: “I hope so - a lot of the products we have are top end so the alcohol minimum prices won’t affect those. “However, we are heavily expanding our lower-end line, and hoping that those who live in the borders will come and buy from us, and we are running promotions for those who live in Scotland and are coming to visit our store.The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) said the price increases will cause consumers to hop across the border.Mike Beale, Chief Executive of the WSTA, told The : “The Scottish Government’s policy will increase the price of around half of the alcohol on supermarket shelves and will impact most drinkers, particularly those on lowest incomes. “The WSTA’s long held view is that MUP is likely to be ineffective in changing the behavior of problem drinkers. There are also serious questions about the potential impact on cross border trade and illicit alcohol.“It is vital therefore that the impact of on businesses and on consumers of the MUP experiment in Scotland is rigorously and objectively monitored and evaluated over time.”Christopher Snowdon, the director of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, told The : I would say that Scots will be hopping across the border to buy alcohol that is, in some cases, less than half price.As with booze cruises to France, some will be doing it legally for their own consumption and others will be doing it to sell illegally in Scotland.A large and legal online business is likely to emerge to satisfy demand and there is nothing the SNP can do about it.This is their folly and they will have to live with the consequences. For those who live a long way from the English border, we may see a growth in home brewing and home distilling. A rise in drug use is also on the cards as people use substances such as Spice as a substitute for cheap alcohol.Scottish people determined to get their hands on cheap alcohol can also purchase it online. Businesses with Scottish premises - this includes Amazon - have to enforce minimum pricing, but those without do not.A business impact report commissioned by the Scottish government explains: “Where alcohol is purchased through the internet or mail order and despatched from outside Scotland, these sales are not subject to the 2005 Act and so minimum pricing will not apply. “Like the potential for cross-border shopping, the incentive to buy from outwith Scotland via the internet will be greater the bigger the price differential between the price of alcohol in Scotland and elsewhere, combined with the volume of goods being purchased.”Some retailers, however, have welcomed the new legislation.Norman Loughery, Off-trade Sales Director at C\u0026ampC, which owns Scottish lager brand Tennent’s, said: “Today is a landmark day for Scotland.“We’ve been supporters of Minimum Unit Pricing since it was first proposed in 2011 and have worked closely with the Scottish Government and our customers around its successful implementation. “We’ve been brewing in Scotland since 1556 and producing cider in Ireland since 1935, and have always held responsible consumption of alcohol as a key priority of our business.We strongly believe that the industry must play its part in tackling alcohol abuse and will therefore continue to work with relevant bodies in the territories in which we operate, including Ireland and Northern Ireland, to seek the introduction of MUP legislation.”Please review our commenting policyOn this day in 1945: Trapped in his bunker, Adolf Hitler makes a will and retires for the last time to his roomCholera epidemic fears in Somalia and Kenya as severe flooding forces families to flee their homesUK weather: Man dies after being swept off pier as \u0026#39month\u0026#39s worth of rain\u0026#39 and gales batter parts of Britain Plane carrying 200 people lands on wrong, unfinished runwayHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Why surfing 50ft waves is like meditationButcher told by police to take down saucy signs - even though no one complained Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsTop photojournalist among dead as twin Kabul suicide blasts kill at least 25Church of England split over US plan to remove \u0026#39husband and wife\u0026#39 from marriage serviceAntarctic glacier the size of Britain threatens to flood coastal towns Cannes festival refuses to withdraw Terry Gilliam’s Don Quixote film in rights battle with producer Alleged Isil supporter denies sharing details of Prince George\u0026#39s schoolMilitary police to excavate site in Germany in bid to solve 36-year-old case of missing British childNetanyahu to speak on \u0026#39significant development\u0026#39 on Iran nuclear deal\u0026#39Mind-reading’ tech being used to monitor Chinese workers\u0026#39 emotionsMexico migrant caravan refused entry to US as border processing area ‘full’ Antiques dealer jailed for life for strangling daughter as wife says he should have killed himself Donald Trump suggests Korean truce village as location for Kim Jong-un summitStonehenge tunnel would spoil the view for drivers, says former National Trust chairman We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/30/08/rts1p3rs.jpg","title":"sainsburys asda merger latest updates store closures job loss locations","story":"Supermarket boss claims no shop floor staff will be made redundant and no branches will close – but\u0026nbspis that credible?Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe has claimed he won’t cut shop-floor jobs or close any stores as a result of the proposed £12bn mega-merger with Asda.But is this credible?The chief executive was careful to make no promises on back-office jobs. Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade.

The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels.

In the context of the Windrush crisis, surely the time has come for the Home Office to put an end to these flights. The public would be horrified if they knew the reality of this process.” Campaigners said the planned deportation flight “beggared belief” after Ms May formally apologised for the treatment of Caribbean families who were welcomed to the UK following the Second World War.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

In particular I will be reallocating £10m with the aim of increasing the number of enforced removals by more than 10 per cent over the next few years: something I believe is ambitious, but deliverable.”As calls mounted for Ms Rudd to resign, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed the figure was merely an “ambition” and she remained unaware of specific local targets.Ms Smith accused both the home secretary and the prime minister of attempting a “cover-up”.“They knew what they were doing, they’re just trying to cover it up,” she added. “Now everything has come out they’re trying to apologise but it doesn’t work.”Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is to be recalled to give evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee (PA)Karen Doyle, national organiser for the Movement for Justice, said the immigrant rights and anti-racist organisation was working on making a submission to the European Court of Human Rights over her case.“Our argument is that the definition the government is working to on Windrush migrants could be widened and the only way that can happen is a full amnesty,” she added.“Notifying people of the charter flight now does seem absolutely crazy, it beggars belief.”The Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group is planning a protest on Tuesday and has started an online petition to stop the “astonishing” flight going ahead.“We oppose such mass deportations and until the government has set out a clear policy on who from Commonwealth countries are protected, they should not be authorising charter flights,” it said.The flights have long been the subject of controversy, with the death of Angolan man Jimmy Mubenga who was fatally restrained on a flight from Heathrow sparking the first national review of practices.In a report published last year, the Independent Monitoring Board Charter Flight Monitoring Team said the treatment of some migrants “fell short” of humane standards.A flight that took 42 people to Jamaica sparked concern about the use of force and restraint, with almost two thirds of detainees held in waist restraint belts.Monitors revealed that detainees had been taken out of immigration removal centres in the dead of night and held on coaches for up to seven-and-a-half hours, before being handed a booklet entitled “Coming Home”.The Home Office declined to comment on the charter flight but responded to MPs’ calls for laws protecting the Windrush generation’s rights by saying they could be guaranteed under existing immigration legislation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cambridge Analytica insisted the Facebook data it received was obtained legally and that it was not used in the Brexit referendum.Mr Banks and Eldon Insurance have denied that the company shared any data with either Leave.EU or with Cambridge Analytica – and insisted the data consultancy did no work for its campaign.AIQ, meanwhile, says it has never been a part of either Cambridge Analytica or SCL, its parent firm, nor entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.However, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating both Leave.EU and Mr Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act, issuing “information notices” requiring specified cooperation.Her office also raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices, as part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum.A few days ago, Ms Denham publicly accused AIQ of failing to co-operate with her inquiry, saying: “We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.”Of the 87 Facebook users whose personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, more than one million live in the UK, the company has acknowledged.“One million people was the margin of the win in the Brexit referendum,” Ms Sandbach pointed out.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402052678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james forsyth local elections","story":"The thinking was disastrous local election results would shock Tory MPs into realising they cannot go on like that and that they needed a new leader.But even Mrs May’s most ardent critics have now accepted that next week’s local elections are unlikely to trigger her downfall.Why? Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She is believed to have been impregnated using the 65-year-old’s sperm and a donor egg.The adoptive parents spent more than £100,000 on the procedure and used a clinic abroad as most in the UK would not deal with a couple their age.The child’s British birth mother and her husband were named on the birth certificate, but they signed a parental order letting the older couple adopt.Social services closely monitored the situation and, after the concerns were raised, the child was taken away and is thought to be in foster care.The adoptive parents have failed in one bid to regain custody but are still fighting. They are thought to be allo-wed some contact in monitored visits.The source said: “This is a very unusual situation.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a little and Johnny is my daddy.“My little age is five, which just kind of fits me. I don’t really ever go lower or move higher than that. That’s what I am comfortable with. That’s what I like.”Max has a list of rules to obey, including no tantrums, no back talk and no staying up past bedtime - and gets banished for a timeout in the naughty corner if she breaks them.She said: “Sometimes if I’m bad my daddy takes away my phone, or I don’t get to watch TV for a certain amount of time, or I have to go to bed early.“But the worst one is being put in timeout because I just have to sit there in the corner and stare at the wall and do nothing - that is not fun at all.”Johnny regularly reads Max a bedtime story before putting her down for her daily nap, after she’s tired herself out playing with her dolls and colouring books.And if Max has been especially good, he takes her to the nearby park to play on the swings and the slide.Max first became a “little” aged 18 after discovering the DDLG community on YouTube.She said: “Listening to people in the community talk about how they felt, that was how I felt. So, I decided to try it out and I have just loved it ever since. It’s just me.I understand why some people will look at the way that I am and the way that I live and be confused and think that it’s disgusting or shameful.But what people fail to see is that this is between two consenting adults and what we do in our home doesn’t really harm anyone else.The pair met while Johnny was working in a tattoo shop and Max came in to get some new artwork.Johnny said: When she came in for a tattoo she looked very nerdy and I was a gigantic nerd myself and we actually became best friends. And slowly but surely she kind of just moved her way into other aspects of my life.“When we first started dating she told me to call her princess and showed me her sippy cup.”However, the pair are adamant that DDLG is a more of a lifestyle for them and that that aspect of their relationship doesn’t transfer over into the bedroom.Max added: “To me, I am little and I use this to strengthen my relationship and to relax and have fun. For us it’s not a sexual thing, but we have no problem with people who do see in that way.And despite the unusual nature of their relationship, Max is at pains to stress that she is an adult capable of making rational decisions.She said: “I work from home, so during the day my littleness comes and goes but when I am with Johnny I am little most of the time.But I do adult stuff all the time. I am an adult. I am 20 years old, I pay my bills.“It’s not something that I can’t control. If we go out go out to a nice dinner of if we are in a grocery store or out in public, I just don’t randomly shout ‘daddy! because that’s involving other people in something that they didn’t consent to.”Max and Johnny educate others about their DDLG lifestyle on their YouTube and Instagram channels Baby Bear Max.And while Max is unsure if she’ll always be a “little”, she says she never wants to shed her childlike innocence.She said: I will always have that childlike sense of wonder about me. I will always be curious. I will always be eager to learn. I will always love Disney movies. I will always love to colour.And whether or not in 20 years I will still call myself a little, I know that I am going to have that inside me.Because I don’t want to grow up. I want to happy and carefree forever and I think that’s true of a lot of people.”Previously an adult baby who wears nappies day and night says his unusual dress-sense is about comfort NOT sex. Meanwhile a woman, 23 found fame as an ‘adult baby’ who wears a nappy as well…and her boyfriend LOVES it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s nothing that surprises us any more. So the impulse has to be even stronger to reach somebody’s mind.“Cannibalism in our minds is connected with violence – horror movies, murders etc.”Bērziņš, who loves to toe the line on what is and isnt acceptable, said there was nothing wrong with people eating their own cooked flesh – in the past he has compared it to biting your fingernails.He said: “What we do daily with ourselves is much worse than any performance.“The viewer has to face the genuineness. Genuine pain. Genuine action that has stepped out of abstraction into a real world.”The 33-year-old artist staged the performance - named Eschatology - on March 6th at a posh museum in capital Riga.Stomach-churning footage shows Bērziņš pulling on a white forensic suit before approaching two assistants with a scalpel. He then cuts a chunk of meat from each of their backs without anaesthetic and frying it in a large black pan.He then forces each assistant to stand before dropping the fried flesh into their mouths.Authorities in the Baltic country are said to be probing the show - but bemused cops cant find anything illegal about it.Bērziņš said: “My parents praised my stunt for being radical and my friends called it powerful – but they do have similar ideals to me.“The viewer needs to be intellectually prepared for such an experience as this. Otherwise they’ll simply claim I have a screw loose and return to the infernal trance of everyday life.The show explores what would happen to humanity if global food stocks ran out.It suggests that people will resort to cannibalism in the face of extinction."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000388480421.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits regret posting facebook twitter snapchat instagram","story":"Researchers found six in ten have shared something they wish they hadnt - and 47 per cent wish they could permanently delete aspects of their digital past over fears of it being used in ways they didn’t intend.More than half of Brits have posted something they regretCredit history, embarrassing photos and ghosts of their dating past are among the top things Brits would like completely removed from online archives amid concerns about their privacy, security and how it might affect their future.Nick Taylor, managing director for Accenture Security, which commissioned the research, said: “In May, new regulations will give everyone in the UK the right for their online data to be forgotten.“Individuals will have the power to decide which businesses can store and use their personal data, and ask companies to delete any information they have about them.In the past, consumers have voted with their wallets now they can also vote with their data.”People share every detail about their lives on social mediaThe study of 2,000 adults also found almost one in ten think about wanting to erase their online past every single day, with another one in five pondering the same thought weekly.More than one quarter named their teenage years as the period of their lives they would most like to remove from their online history, with 17 per cent wanting to erase their university years.And 23 per cent said the window into their life outside of work is what they would most like to remove from their digital record.As a result, seven in 10 think UK residents should have the ‘right to be forgotten’ when it comes to their social media or online data.More than half of Brits don’t feel completely comfortable with retailers storing their personal data, with an equal number feeling the same about utility companies.Three in 10 are uncomfortable with banks storing their data, and seven in 10 feel uneasy at the thought of social media businesses saving their information.Twenty-seven per cent even admitted they are on edge due to the data the NHS keeps about them and 41 per cent said the same about their personal information which is kept by their employer.Just under two in five are concerned about how their digital history might cause them to lose out on a job or how it might be used against them in future.And more than half feel unsettled by the fact there could be information about themselves lurking on the internet which they can’t delete.Because of this, 68 per cent find themselves worrying about the security of their personal data which has either been shared online or stored digitally.But the results found its no surprise many are fretting about how their digital data might be used, with the average adult spending five hours and 11 minutes a day online.This insecurity also means just three in 10 recognise the rewards which could come from companies tracking their digital history, including personalised discounts, loyalty schemes and quicker payment processes.Nick Taylor added: “This research shows many people don’t fully believe companies will always do the right thing with their personal information and so businesses clearly have a job to do to build digital trust.“They worry about security and privacy and don’t see the benefits of companies collecting and using their data, like personalised services and discounts.The new GDPR regulations present an opportunity for companies to prove themselves, deepen digital trust and do more, not less, with consumer data.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As part of the feature a photofit was released of a man seen at the NAAFI on the day Katrice disappeared, holding a child similar to Katrice and getting into a green saloon car. We are keen to hear from anyone who could help to identify this person.A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car.The investigation team would also like to hear from anyone who was living in the Paderborn area who owned a green saloon car in 1981, so that they can be ruled out of the teams enquiries.Officer OLeary said: Thirty six years have passed and allegiances may have changed.We are appealing to members of the public and the military community, including veterans and retired civil servants in both Germany and the UK - do you know what happened to Katrice?She had been shopping for her second birthday tea treats with her mum Sharon at the Schloss Neuhaus NAAFI supermarket when she disappeared.The case, which has chilling similarities to season two of BBC drama The Missing, remains unsolved.Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was “gone in a matter of seconds”. She added: “It’s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.“Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn’t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.Fighting back tears, Sharon told The Sun: “Although I would like a fairytale ending to our story, I fully appreciate that might not be.“But at the end of the day, we will have closure and any emotions that come from that closure we will learn to live with and deal with as we have for the past nearly 37 years.“The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter’s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.“That’s another emotion we have to learn to live with.”Katrice’s dad Staff Sergeant Richard Lee, of the King’s Royal Hussars, was posted in West Germany at the height of the Cold War.On November 28, 1981, the NAAFI was rammed on the last payday before Christmas. Sharon said: “If you wanted English goodies, that was the time to get them.Katrice wouldn’t sit in the trolley, so I carried her all the way around in my arms doing my shopping.“When we got to the checkout I realised I’d forgotten crisps.“I put Katrice down and said to my sister Wendy, ‘Just keep an eye on her while I go back to the crisps stand’. It wasn’t far away. It took me about 40 seconds, a minute at most. When I got back I asked, ‘Where’s Katrice?’.“My sister said, ‘I thought she was with you. She ran and followed you’.“I went back down the aisle and she wasn’t there. Panic started to set in. I couldn’t see her anywhere. There was so many people. I was calling her name. Katrice couldn’t be found — she wasn’t there.”The Royal Military Police and German cops worked on the assumption the little girl — wearing red wellies, a turquoise duffle coat and tartan dress — wandered off, fell into another nearby river, the flooded Lippe, and drowned. But a hunt proved fruitless.Statements from shop staff were not taken for six weeks and details of an eye condition Katrice had were not released.The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012.Sharon, of Gosport, Hants, now divorced from Richard, is convinced Katrice was abducted. She said: “It’s my belief she left the NAAFI shop that morning, but she didn’t leave alone. I can’t believe — the NAAFI was so busy that morning — that a two-year-old walked out and disappeared off the face of the Earth and no one saw what happened.“I still have to go out and face the world and go about a daily routine but this situation never leaves you.“You can’t live with it 24/7. You have to push it to the back of your mind. But first thing in the morning and last thing at night, those are the times it gets to you.”Thanks to the family’s campaigning, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered extra resources for Operation Bute — the cold case probe run by a 28-strong RMP task force.Dad Richard, now 68, had criticised the RMP handling of the case, but felt his voice had “finally been heard” at a summit with Mr Williamson this year. He said: “Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.”As cops appeal again for information to help solve the case, Sharon added: “If people put themselves in my shoes for five minutes and feel how we have lived and felt for the past 36 years, then maybe those feelings would get them to come forward.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
