It also has its own crypt so you can stay forever. I am doing some work on the crypt at the moment, it’s quite a nice crypt, but I am not looking to be buried there.\u0027 A charitable employer Peterson also said an admission fee should be charged which would go towards some small cottages he had built for the labour force which helped construct the tower, at a cost of £30,000 at the time.Entrepreneur Paul said he first took over Peterson\u0027s legacy using the proceeds he made from selling and transporting a Bentley to New York.Paul, who has bought and sold goods and furniture all his life, said: \u0027When we opened as a hotel we had some pretty important guests come to stay including the speaker of the House of Lords and celebrities from stage and screen. \u0027We\u0027ve got a rather nice guest book that comes with the tower.\u0027Paul\u0027s wife Julie said when the family first moved the tower was mostly occupied by pigeons and jackdaws.She said: \u0027One jackdaw became part of the family believing that I was his parent, he spent most of his time on my shoulder telling me what to do.\u0027The spiral staircase was like a helter skelter so we cleared out the tower and it took two lorries to move the debris. After this the tower quickly became an office, a sewing room, a woodworking shop and even a garden shed.\u0027The swimming pool and garden took up most of our time and of course our two children growing up.\u0027We kept the tower tidy and enjoyed amazing views of the Solent, Isle of Wight, winter with the snow on the fields, watching cows driven down the lane to the farm for milking and in June the light summer evenings were spectacular.\u0027We opened our doors to our new gorgeous hotel and restaurant in 1991, this was the most exciting time for all of us, our guests were very varied and enthusiastic about this amazing tower, its place in history and construction.\u0027Nobody complained about the stairs and they forgave us for not offering room service. We made for being new to the business by offering a very special small restaurant run by two talented young chefs at the start of their careers.\u0027The fascination with tall buildings endures, in the recent census the tower has a special position of being the tallest building in Britain occupied by one family.\u0027Life in the tower has settled down and we became dog owners at our son\u0027s request and walked more frequently in the New Forest. We also keep fit by going up the 70 stairs to the bedroom at night.\u0027We all tended to communicate with each other by using our landline at first, or even walkie-talkies, now the mobiles help us, as they are always in our pockets.\u0027Sway Tower: For sheer folly, nothing beats a four-bed home with 330 steps to the top | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"13 500 sign petition reinstate charity boss criticised far Left Black Lives Matter UK","story":"Share this article \u0027It has made me realise I was correct to speak out.’Last week, Mancunian Way said its decision to terminate its relationship with Mr Buckley ‘was not based on, nor influenced by, his personal blog posts, nor any social media comments or online petitions’.But the charity has refused to say why it did remove him. Its interim chief executive, Joe Beech, said: ‘While Mr Buckley is focused on getting his name in the papers, our focus, as Mancunian Way, is on the important outreach work we do.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058b47cc4daa45259e594e1d960b8c0000a4b0de/0_415_7703_4621/master/7703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937ca3be28d72135e2fc3399855a9071","title":"its made a difference to the family the children going back to school","story":"As primary and secondary schools put measures in place for a partial return, staff, parents and pupils explain to Rosie Mullender how they are adaptingHome schooling has become the new normal for millions of children across the UK. And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Then a voice echoed around the west London housing estate: “We are passing through the valley of the shadow of death, but we are not alone.” It was Sunday 19 April, when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its most intense in London and the earth was shifting beneath our feet.The Rev Pat Allerton, a Church of England vicar, pressed a button on his phone to play Judy Collins’ powerful rendition of Amazing Grace, and something extraordinary happened.Faces appeared behind glass, windows opened and people leaned out. Residents came on to balconies. Some held up small children to see. A woman aided by a walking frame shuffled on to a path. A couple of older men in vests stood with their arms crossed women in hijabs came out of their homes a man wearing a kippah stopped to listen.Amazing Grace faded and Allerton took up his microphone. As he began the Lord’s Prayer, some people bowed their heads, some put their hands together, some mouthed words taught many years before. A few wept. No one laughed or jeered or heckled. In the middle of one of the most cosmopolitan cities on earth, this was a communal moment of spirituality.A month earlier, the Church of England had suspended services and locked its church doors. Mosques cancelled Friday prayers, temples closed, synagogues shut. At a critical moment when people were frightened, uncertain and in desperate need of comfort and hope, congregational prayer and worship, the cornerstone of organised religion, was no longer. Faith leaders were forced to find new ways of reaching out.Allerton decided that if people were unable to go to church, he would take church to the people. He rented a cargo bike, borrowed a sound system and bought a portable generator online. He was uncertain how people would react to his bite-sized services on the streets, in estates and outside hospitals. But he said: “I’ve been amazed by the response. People feel very emotional. They are looking for answers.” The crisis had shown a “spiritual hunger out there”, he added.Five million people tuned in to a service led by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, at a makeshift altar on his kitchen table on 22 March, broadcast on the BBC and Facebook. The C of E, which has seen a steep decline in churchgoing in recent decades, said it was the largest single “congregation” in its history.Clergy at St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square were astonished to find more than 1,000 people joining their online morning prayer sessions. At St Nics in Durham, more than 2,300 people watched a streamed service one Sunday in March, compared with a normal attendance of about 300.The Church of England launched a 24-hour free phone line for Christian worship and prayer, aimed at people with no or limited access to the internet and offering “words of comfort and hope”. More than 6,000 calls were made in the first 48 hours of operation.Other faiths and denominations saw similar trends. Anglicans, Pentecostals, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus and others rapidly developed or expanded online prayers and services. Remarkably, the transfer of faith to the easily accessible and informal virtual world unleashed a new experimentation.“People who might be curious but perhaps inhibited by unfamiliar dress codes or arcane rituals discovered they could try out faith anonymously, log in to different services, even cross religions,” said Ed Kessler, founder director of the interfaith Woolf Institute. “You might think: I wonder what happens at Muslim prayers – now you can find out.” Rather like a pub crawl, people could do a “place of worship crawl”.As religious leaders learned to master the mute button, some sought more creative ways to keep the faith.In Stamford Hill in north London, Europe’s biggest ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the closure of synagogues and the government’s edict to maintain physical distance from people outside one’s household were grievous blows.Two weeks before lockdown began, Jews celebrated the festival of Purim with prayer services and parties, where dancing, singing and embracing almost certainly spread the virus. Two weeks after the start of lockdown, as the Jewish death toll from Covid-19 was rising at an alarming rate, Passover – traditionally another time of communal worship and family feasts – was marked in isolation.For many Jews, the directive from faith leaders to pray at home or online was not simple. Many ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews have limited access to the internet, and the use of technology is prohibited on Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. Moreover, a minyan – a physical quorum of 10 males over the age of 13 – is required for prayer. How could they meet both the requirements of their faith and the coronavirus constraints?Joel Snitzer had an idea. The owner of a construction company and the father of 10 children, Snitzer went to the synagogue to pray three times a day before lockdown. Now the synagogue was locked, but perhaps he and his neighbours could form a minyan, each separated in their own back garden.Over a weekend, he built a bimah, a raised platform from which the Torah is read, where his garden meets the garden backing it. He fetched the Torah scroll from his synagogue. The neighbours agreed on a daily act of worship at 9.45am. To all intents and purposes, they created a backyard synagogue.“We’re fortunate to have so many of us living in adjacent properties,” he said one morning in early May. “Jews have had many challenges in our history, and we usually find a way of adapting – and this is what we’ve done now. People are thriving on it, especially the older generation who can’t leave their homes.”After attaching tefillin – small leather boxes containing handwritten parchments – to his forehead and bicep, winding the straps seven times around his forearm and hand, Snitzer adjusted his tallit, or prayer shawl, and climbed the steps to the bimah for their daily act of worship. In gardens and on flat roofs, his neighbours gathered with their prayer books.Not quite all the neighbours: the family living next door to the Snitzers are Muslim. Wass Bham had no problem with daily Jewish prayers. “I think it’s a good thing that people find a way to practice their religion and achieve a sense of community in a safe way at this time,” he said. “Muslims and Jews have a lot in common. And at the end of the day we are living side by side.”By then, Bham had been fasting during daylight hours for two weeks, with another two weeks still ahead of him. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, was an unprecedented challenge this year, with people unable to go to the mosque to pray after sunset and prohibited from sharing their iftar meals to break the daily fast with loved ones.“This is something completely new for us,” said Mohammed Kozbar, the chairman of the Finsbury Park mosque, shortly before Ramadan began. “We would normally have about 2,000 people coming through the mosque every day – even those who don’t normally pray. Now the mosque is locked and empty. It’s heartbreaking.”The silver lining was the chance to spend more time with his family, he said. With the closure of mosques, Muslim men and women began praying at home together for the first time. It was “one of the small blessings we can see in this horrendous situation,” said Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, a Leicester imam.The East London mosque, which serves the UK’s biggest Muslim community and usually has around 7,000 people in attendance on Fridays, decided – similarly to Allerton – that if people couldn’t come to the mosque for iftar, they would take iftar to the people. In partnership with the charity Supporting Humanity, throughout Ramadan they delivered hundreds of meals to Muslim and non-Muslim staff at the Royal London hospital.One recipient, Boshura Khatun, a respiratory and cardiac nurse, said the hospital felt like “a war zone” when Ramadan began. She had prioritised her patients over her prayers on many evenings and had often gone home with a “banging headache” after a 12-hour shift in full PPE and with no food or water. Ayesha Khan, another nurse, also had not always found the time to pray. “I feel sad about it, but I also feel I’ve become closer to God through this crisis. My faith has definitely deepened.”For many people, the pandemic has led to a fundamental recalibration of the way we live and what is really important. In contemplating mortality, the question “is this it?” takes on weight and urgency. No wonder there has been some degree of religious revival – but how enduring it is remains to be seen.Now some faith leaders are asking themselves whether the changes in the way they have practiced their faith under lockdown will leave a lasting mark. In conversation with Kessler about the new religious landscape, Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, wondered whether time was up on the concept of religious institutions as “official brokers” between people and God. Joe Aldred, a Pentecostal bishop, said lockdown had “solidified my longstanding sense of wanting to understand God beyond the euphoria of what happens on a Sunday”. Isolation, he added, could “enrich the spiritual experience”.Faith leaders had adapted surprisingly quickly to new circumstances, said Kessler. “They have generated new communities, some of which will survive. But the institutionalisation of religion will be less important in the future. People might want certainty, but they don’t want rigidity.”Allerton had similar thoughts. Of his church congregation, he said: “Like any family, we miss each other and we long to be back together. But there’s been real learning about how to reach out and reconnect with the world. Our message stays the same, but its delivery needs to move with the times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8161a84ea7248da610194c1541cca38ed5496a0/0_220_3398_2040/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecdd76016effaaee231ab036c032a9c4","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests, protests in Hong Kong and the impact of Covid-19: the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bbbdcbc32ea0d26a9cf3965f9ede76e1616d2e5/0_512_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79c8167866172a908b78e061d95c67aa","title":"imagine a new america reclaiming flag photos","story":"With the explosion of global protests and activism demanding an end to racial inequality, Jameelah Nuriddin and Erin Hammond consider the complicated relationship between African Americans and the American flag in a series of photos.

Warren East, chief executive of jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, is losing a sympathetic but by this time well-lubricated audience for his keynote speech at the aerospace and defence industry’s annual shindig. The word coronavirus is still firmly confined to the foreign sections of newspapers (even if Asian markets are starting to get jittery), and the industry is readying itself for another year of growth.Even a month later, on 28 February, Rolls-Royce is able to shrug off the threat of the virus with results “reinforcing our confidence for 2020”. East predicts that the company will reduce the number of Boeing Dreamliners grounded because of longstanding issues with Rolls-Royce’s Trent 1000 engines to “single digits” by the end of June.How different the world looks now, as Rolls-Royce prepares for a trading update on Thursday covering the period since its last update, in April. For investors looking at Rolls-Royce since air travel stalled, the question has been: exactly how bad is it?In a few short months, the manufacturer has lost a big chunk of its commercial aviation revenues, which represented the majority of its business in 2019. In good times, servicing the engines it makes guarantees it a steady flow of income during the pandemic, that has dried up, as hours flown by its engines fell by half in March alone. On Thursday, investors will be keen to see whether May and June showed anything like a rebound in the number of jets in the skies.The company’s initial response to the revenue hit was to cut 9,000 jobs in a bid to save £1.3bn a year in costs. About two-thirds of redundancies will be in the UK, which is a blow to one of the UK’s few remaining home-grown industrial leaders – and especially to Derby, where the brunt of the cuts will fall. (In May, East’s unwise “smirking” during a BBC interview about the job cuts was heavily criticised on social media.)Yet even the ruthlessness of the third-largest job cuts programme by a UK company during the pandemic was not enough to save Rolls-Royce’s credit rating from a painful downgrade to junk status, after more than 20 years at investment grade. S\u0026ampP Global Ratings judged that more financial pain could be on the way this year as the pandemic continues to disrupt air travel.Rolls-Royce’s shares have dropped below 280p, where they stood in February 2009 in the depths of the financial crisis. What will it take to propel Rolls back to the halcyon days of late January, when shares were worth more than double that, at 683p? Or indeed the 850p mark they were at when East took over, almost five years ago this week?The way back looks long indeed, even if the company can depend on government grant funding and cheap loans to stave off any existential threats – or indeed a return to the nationalisation of the 1970s. Its access to cash and loans remains fairly healthy, despite the junk rating.However, Rolls-Royce’s engines are mainly bolted to planes that fly longer-haul routes. That means its recovery depends on people the world over being willing to spend 10 hours squashed up against a stranger – which is enough to make investors as well as travellers squeamish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61239ec0472f73fcb65606845668fa1b99b1fa45/0_270_6601_3961/master/6601.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=805ac60e5ba0550668f8058ecace5e5e","title":"why do muslim states stay silent over chinas uighur brutality","story":"Nations that claim to be defenders of the faith offer no protest to the concentration campsWhen China imposed trade sanctions on Norway in 2010 for honouring the imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo with the Nobel peace prize, it spat out a word we weren’t used to hearing from propagandists for an atheist communist regime, but should get used to today. “It’s a blasphemy,” a party mouthpiece said.Once, blasphemy was damning the faithful’s gods and sacred books. Now, criticism of the world’s largest dictatorship has become sacrilegious. You shouldn’t be surprised. As some of us tried to say in the 1990s and 2000s, the gap between the sacred and the profane was never as wide as religious sentimentalists and liberal multiculturalists believed.They went along with the argument that it was bad taste at best and racism at worst to offend believers. You were “punching down” at largely poor and largely Muslim communities. We thought they were being wilfully blind. They did not understand how men with real power and malice were manipulating religious outrage to consolidate their rule over their wretched population. Iran issued a death sentence on Salman Rushdie in 1989 for satirising Islam’s foundation myths in The Satanic Verses. Its theocratic dictator, Ayatollah Khomeini, was augmenting his powers by claiming to speak for the Muslim world, as well as taking aim at novelists. When the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published largely innocuous cartoons of Muhammad in 2005, to assert the right to mock religion, the Egyptian and Syrian dictators, Hosni Mubarak and Bashar al-Assad, turned a local argument into a global campaign against Denmark. The cries of rage usefully distracted from their corruption and misrule. I could add further examples but they tell the same story. Authoritarian politics and authoritarian religion are just two sides of the same debased coin.China has stripped away the religious justifications to reveal what was once half-hidden: unadorned and unstoppable power. In many countries, criticising China is the new blasphemy. Nowhere can you see the power more nakedly displayed than in Muslim-majority regimes. Once, they tried to murder blasphemous novelists and screamed about their desire to defend the prophet from the smallest insult. Today, they bend their knees and bite their tongues as China engages in unspeakable atrocities against the largely Muslim Uighur population of western China.One of the great crimes of the 21st century is being committed in front of our eyes. We see it, yet we don’t register it. The Chinese Communist party is reverting to type, and reviving the totalitarian fear of the Mao era. To bring down numbers of the largely Muslim Uighurs of Xinjiang, the China scholar Adrian Zenz reports, the Communists are forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices. If they resist, the state sends them to join the one million Uighur people and other Muslim minorities detained in what the state defines as “re-education” camps. A BBC investigation found that China was separating children from their families so they grew up without understanding Islam.It may be a cheap point but it remains true that if a western country were to display one-tenth, one-hundredth or one-thousandth of the brutality that China is inflicting on Muslims, the global left would be burning with outrage.If you want to be charitable, its silence can in part be explained by logistical difficulties. Reporters are free to cover China’s suppression of democracy in Hong Kong, for the time being at any rate, but cannot get near Xinjiang without taking extraordinary risks. With no footage of their suffering, millions can suffer unnoticed in the dark.But the main reasons why Muslims suffer in silence is that the Muslim-majority countries that raged against Rushdie, Jyllands-Posten and Charlie Hebdo have decided to stay silent. They use the idea of Muslim solidarity only when it suits them.In July 2019, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and other Muslim-majority states that pose as defenders of the faith helped to block a western motion at the United Nations calling for China to allow “independent international observers” into the Xinjiang region. Iran issues occasional criticisms but wants Chinese support in its struggle against the Trump administration and so keeps its complaints coded. Their hypocrisy is almost funny, if you take your humour black. Iran, Egypt, Syria and dozens of other countries that could not tolerate a magical realist novel can live with the mass sterilisation of Muslim women. They will give concentration camps a conniving wink of approval, but draw the line at cartoons in a Danish newspaper.Many have been bought off. China is now a more active and influential voice at the United Nations because so many countries are benefiting from billions of dollars in Chinese investments through its “Belt and Road” infrastructure programme. As Norway found in 2010, and Australia found this year when it asked for an international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, those who blaspheme against China face cyber-attacks and sanctions. Better to take the rewards and avoid the punishments.Following the money, however, can lead you into a dead end. In a survey of China’s growing power, the Economist noted it was making the world safe for autocracy. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for example, keeps his conservative base happy in Turkey by posing as an ostentatiously Islamic strongman. But he is not likely to condemn the abuse of Muslims by China when he is just as keen on abusing the rights of his domestic opponents. The Chinese world order appeals to the freemasonry of publicity-shy sadists. You say nothing about what we do to our subject people and we will say nothing about what you do to yours.“The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas – uncertainty, progress, change – into crimes,” said Salman Rushdie when he was in fear of his life in 1990. He was talking about conservative Islam. China is now turning criticism of its disastrous record on incubating the Covid-19 virus and its atrocities against its Muslim minorities into crimes, and the people who should be shouting the loudest are bowing their heads in reverential silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bcfb8b8f5a5c021afb034de8606be1982e7db02/0_413_6747_4047/master/6747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b02bfdf8aabc862d95f2eb0a9f7e9ea5","title":"on my radar rachel parris on her cultural highlights","story":"The comedian and Mash Report star on Lemn Sissay’s memoir, Tank and the Bangas’ mindblowing hip-hop, and a very weird podcastComedian and musician Rachel Parris was born in 1984 in Leicester.

You see sitcoms that use it, like Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock, but you don’t see actual shows where they get a word or an idea, and just go. These two guys are amazing together. You can tell when two improvisers have been working together for donkey’s years, because they’re just so good at riffing off each other. In this country, commissioners are so scared of improv, but I really hope this is the start of something… that people watch this and go: “That’s really funny every time – there’s no risk.”Marek Larwood takes famous works of art and tries to recreate them in 15 minutes. It’s really pure. I like that he’s not an expert at it. He did The Hay Wain by Constable and has done some modern and some really classical stuff. They’re not always good, and at the end of every one he goes: “Oh Christ, this is appalling.” He invites people who have watched him to send in the ones they’ve done in 15 minutes. So there is a sort of gallery at the end. It’s really well meaning and quite wholesome.Tank and the BangasI met poet Lemn Sissay through my husband. Lemn wrote this amazing and heartbreaking book last year, which I have only just read. It’s about his journey through the social care system in the 70s and 80s. He publishes the official records of what happened to him when he was a child. It’s incredibly page-turning. The racism that Lemn faced even from his own foster family… you can’t believe what you’re reading. I was prompted into reading it with everything that’s happening with Black Lives Matter.The Anthropocene Reviewed by John GreenThis podcast is so weird. John Green reviews things ranging from tuberculosis to the remote control. He reads these beautifully written essays and at the end gives the thing marks out of five. Things that he’s reviewed include the qwerty keyboard, the human capacity for wonder, the Notes app. The board game Monopoly was an interesting one, because its origins are actually a really damning indictment of capitalism. It was invented by a woman years before it was later released by Parker Brothers, after a man stole the idea and got a patent for it.Viggo Mortensen stars in this film. It’s about a dad raising a family in the middle of a national park in America with no electricity and no contact with the outside world. It starts off being really idyllic, but then begins to explore the reality of what happens when the kids need to go out into the real world. Mortensen plays a very hands-on dad, but you begin to find out the backstory – what happened to his wife, why this life means so much to him. It all gets complicated, but it’s really uplifting and visually beautiful.

Today is the day that here, in England at least, we can finally reopen our restaurants after many months of lockdown. The level of excitement is high, particularly for those of us who love our industry as much as we love our own families, but there is also a deep fear for its future and the livelihood of those who work in it. Across the ocean, some will be celebrating American Independence Day, while others will be asking for a much-needed, soul-searching conversation about broken race relations. In such times, it is hard to talk about just food, but I think it is also vital to focus on the power food has to fix things that are broken and, eventually, to unite.Tater tots are deep-fried cylinders of grated potatoes served in diners and cafeterias across the US. This version is baked, rather than fried, and served with tangy feta yoghurt and coriander oil. Serve as a nibble or a side.1kg baking potatoes (ie, 3-4)Salt and black pepper1¼ tsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted and roughly crushed in a mortar2½ tsp cornflour3 limes – 1 zested, to get 4 tsp, 2 juiced, to get 1 tbsp, and 1 cut in half2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for shapingFor the feta yoghurt80g Greek feta, finely crumbled80g Greek-style yoghurtFor the coriander oil 4 tbsp coriander leaves, roughly chopped3 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly choppedPeel the potatoes, put them in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, and fill with enough cold water to cover by about 3cm. Season the water with two teaspoons of salt and bring to a boil on a medium-high heat. Turn down the heat to medium, cover and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, or until a knife can slide into the centre of the potatoes but still meets with some resistance (the potatoes shouldn’t be completely cooked through). Drain, run under cold water to stop them cooking further, then pat dry with a tea towel. Use a box grater roughly to grate the potatoes into a large bowl (they will be a little sticky). Add a teaspoon of cumin seeds, all the cornflour, a tablespoon of lime zest, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then, using well-oiled hands, mix everything together to combine.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put a small bowl of oil next to your work surface, and start shaping the tater tots. Use a spoon to scoop up about a tablespoon (20g) of the potato mixture, and, again using well-oiled hands, roll it into a compact ball. Shape the ball into a cylinder – don’t worry if it’s not uniform and perfect, but do try to make it as tight and compact as possible. Transfer to a large oven tray (or two smaller ones) lined with greaseproof paper, and repeat with the rest of the potato mix, spacing them slightly apart – you should end up with about 42 tater tots in total. Drizzle the tater tots all over with two tablespoons of oil, then transfer to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, turning them all once halfway, until nicely golden on both sides.Meanwhile, make the feta yoghurt by whisking the feta, yoghurt, tablespoon of lime juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a bowl until smooth.Now for the oil: put the coriander, oil, garlic, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz smooth.To serve, spread the feta mix on one side of a serving platter and drizzle some coriander oil on top. Pile the tater tots alongside, sprinkle with the remaining quarter-teaspoon of cumin seeds and a teaspoon of lime zest, squeeze the lime halves over the top and serve warm.These enchiladas are a Tex-Mex favourite, and with good reason. The chilli paste is a fantastic condiment in its own right – you could just make that alone, if you like, and keep it in a jar in the fridge, ready to add to sandwiches, sauces and stews.Prep 25 minCook 1 hr 20 minMakes 6, to serve 2350g cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped300g roasting potatoes, skin on, cut into 1cm cubes450g lamb mince6 corn tortillas (choose ones about 15cm in diameter)80g soured cream2 spring onions, trimmed and cut into julienne strips1 avocado, stoned, peeled and cut into 2cm cubes3 jalapeño chillies, finely sliced into rounds2 limes, cut into wedges, to serveFor the chilli paste2 tsp chipotle flakes2 red chillies, roughly chopped¾ tsp ground cumin1 tsp chilli flakes110g tomato paste5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped½ onion, peeled and roughly chopped75ml olive oil, plus extra for brushingSaltHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)475Fgas 9.Put all the chilli sauce ingredients in a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor with two and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and blitz to a smooth paste, scraping down the sides a couple of times as you go. Transfer half the paste to a 30cm x 20cm oven tray, add the tomatoes to the rest and blitz again to a smooth salsa, to make the salsa roja.Add the potatoes and lamb mince to the chilli paste tray and toss with your (gloved) hands until everything is well coated, breaking apart the mince into small chunks as you go. Transfer to the oven and bake for 35 minutes, stirring once halfway through and breaking the mince apart again, this time with a fork. Scrape the lamb and potato mix into a medium bowl and keep the tray unwashed, because you’ll be using it again later.Turn down the oven to 210C (190C fan)410Fgas 6½. Pile up the tortillas on a piece of foil, wrap them up and put in the oven for six minutes, just to warm through and to make them easier to roll.To build the enchiladas, put a sixth of the lamb mix in the middle of each warm tortilla, then roll up tightly and place seam side down on the reserved tray. Brush the tortillas with a little oil, then spoon the salsa roja on top and bake for 25 minutes.Spoon the soured cream over the enchiladas, drizzle with some more oil, then top with the spring onions, avocado and jalapeños, and serve with the lime wedges to squeeze on top.Cheesecakes and blueberries pies are as American as puddings get. Here, I’ve combined them into one dish. This crostata isn’t overly sweet, which makes it perfect for a brunch spread or an afternoon treat.For the pastry100g plain flour50g wholemeal flour30g icing sugar¼ tsp salt145g fridge-cold unsalted butter, cut into 1½cm cubes65ml ice-cold water1 egg yolk, beatenFor the cream cheese filling200g full-fat cream cheese, softened at room temperature50g icing sugar2 tsp cornflour3-4 limes – zest grated to get 4 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp½ tsp vanilla bean paste, or vanilla extractFor the blueberries200g blueberries, fresh, or frozen and defrosted20g icing sugar, plus 1 tsp extra, to serveFirst make the pastry. In a large bowl, whisk both flours, the sugar and salt to combine, then add the butter cubes and incorporate them into the flour by squashing each one between your fingers: don’t overwork it though – you want chunks of butter throughout the dough – so just a light squish will do. Add the water and use your hands to gather together the dough into a shaggy mess.Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and use a well-floured rolling pin to roll it out into a roughly 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Fold the longer ends in towards each other, so they meet in the centre, then roll over once with a rolling pin. Fold in the shorter ends in the same way as before, roll out again, then fold in half, and then in half again, so you’re left with a square. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, make the base. In a medium bowl, whisk the cream cheese, icing sugar, cornflour, a tablespoon of the lime zest, all the lime juice and the vanilla until smooth and with no lumps.In a separate bowl, combine the blueberries and icing sugar, and use a fork or whisk roughly to crush the berries until some are mashed and some are whole.Line a large oven tray with baking paper. On a well-floured work surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the chilled dough into a rough, 32cm-diameter circle (it doesn’t have to be perfect). Carefully lift the circle on to the lined tray, spread all over with the cream cheese mixture, leaving a 1cm border all around the edge, then use the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly. Next, dot with half of the crushed blueberry mixture, so there are still some white bits exposed.Use a knife to make small, 2cm cuts about 8cm apart all around the outside of the galette. Take one of the resulting dough strips and fold it inwards towards the centre. Repeat with the next strip, pulling gently so it overlaps slightly with the previous one and seals the previous fold. Repeat with all the strips all around the edge of the galette, then refrigerate on the tray for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8. Brush the exposed pastry edges with the egg yolk, transfer the tray to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)wgas 4 and bake for another 25 minutes, until golden and cooked through. While the crostata is still warm, gently lift it on the baking paper lining to a cooling rack (this will help prevent it getting a soggy bottom), and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes.Lightly dust the crostata with the remaining teaspoon of icing sugar, sprinkle over the last teaspoon of lime zest, and serve with the remaining crushed blueberries in a bowl alongside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70fd681056dc5938b731a0458e9eb6f6b0324729/0_40_3811_2287/master/3811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ebd06c3bcf9a1998be3fbe3cfbc792","title":"chelsea watford premier league match report","story":"At a chilly, damp, echoey Stamford Bridge Chelsea had too much guile and craft for an eager but limited Watford team.Goals from Olivier Giroud and Willian towards the end of the first half were enough to overwhelm opponents who spent much of the opening 80 minutes crouched behind a dogged defensive guard.Watford ended the day a point above the bottom three, having played one game more than Aston Villa. They seem likely to stay in the Premier League, such is the level of organisation in Nigel Pearson’s team and the brittleness of those around them. But another blank here means Watford have scored twice in five winless games since that wonderfully-executed defeat of Liverpool.As for Chelsea, this will feel like a successfully discharged training game, with Ross Barkley an urgent presence in midfield, and scorer of a third goal at the end.At the start of play Manchester United had edged Frank Lampard’s team out of the top four for the first time since October. It has been a year in the job now for Chelsea’s legend-leader-manager, and despite the apparent good health of Chelsea’s season, there have been some gripes from the sidelines of late.Chelsea have a problem defending set pieces. Chelsea have a problem with counterattacks. Chelsea have a coach-load of elite midfielders but no proper deep-lying shield (N’Golo Kanté remains the best outright tackling midfielder on the planet).Here Lampard stationed Kanté and Ross Barkley as a hustling pivot, with Willian, Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic a mobile trident behind the forward ballast of Giroud. And happily there are few things that can’t be put right by meeting an opponent of such limited ambition as Watford here.Troy Deeney patrolled ahead of a five-man yellow-shirted midfield. But the early exchanges were all at the other end, as Watford sat in a deep double bolt and withstood some energetic but diffuse Chelsea pressure. Willian had the first real shot on target with 14 minutes gone.Four minutes later a lovely, slick combination between Mount and Pulisic ended with Giroud shooting hard and low but into the legs of Ben Foster, whose positioning was beautifully judged. Otherwise this was a tight, slow-burn first quarter of attack versus defence.The silence inside the stadium produced its usual revelations. Deeney really does spend a lot of time talking to, bonding with, and generally getting to know the linesman. Foster does a lot of shouting about metres and distances when the opposition has a free-kick near his goal. And Giroud’s agonised howl of pain on being fouled outside the box , a howl so loud you half expected to look up and see him holding his foot in one hand, was enough to draw an actual laugh from Frank Lampard.It was Giroud who opened the scoring with 27 minutes gone. It came from a slick little passing exchange. Mount fed Barkley, who played another short forward pass to Giroud in a sliver of space down the side of Christian Kabasele. Giroud rotated his hips to wrong-foot Foster and shot before he could adjust, sending the ball trickling into the far corner.Watford hadn’t switched on again from the drinks break. But it was still a lovely little piece of pass-and-move in a tight space. The goal was Giroud’s ninth touch and his fourth shot. He has three now in five games as the number-one No 9.Watford roused themselves, Ismaïla Sarr making some ground down the right. But it was 2-0 three minutes before half time, the goal reward for more heavy Chelsea pressure. As Pulisic scurried across the right side of the box, heading away from goal, Étienne Capoue bumped him to the ground, an entirely needless foul. Willian put the kick away with ease, waiting for Foster to fall one way, then king it the other.The second half brought much of the same, with the entire game condensed into one end of the pitch for long periods. Watford were committed and organised but they didn’t look like a team with any clear idea of how it hoped to score a goal. The loss of Gerard Deulofeu has stripped the midfield of invention. Here it took 73 minutes to muster a shot on target.Up front Deeney was a vocal organiser, although at times his approach to the role brought to mind Brian Glover as the PE teacher in Kes: plenty of pointing and shouting, plenty of authority, but not really keeping pace with the striplings around him.For Chelsea Kurt Zouma was sure-footed at the back He may lack an elegant way with a pass but he is this team’s best pure defender in that role.Giroud almost made it three around the hour mark but was foiled by a fine close-range block from Foster. The Watford keeper then saved low down from Willian, who might as well take out an advert hoarding on Chelsea’s left touchline with the words ‚“cuts inside, shoots” for all the attention Premier League defences seem to pay to the fact that he tends to cut inside and shoot.There was time for Ruben Loftus-Cheek to produce a stunning miss, heading over the bar unmarked in front of goal from Reece James’ cross. And at the death Barkley added a third, tucking the ball into the corner from César Azpilicueta’s cut-back. Lampard will take heart from the solidity of this performance after the horror of defeat at West Ham. For Watford, the season’s end looks like an extended struggle from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e03c7e44ff61839759b84dc2e9787a802f921c9/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249e39acec11cf1db219310dcc0ae78c","title":"klopps dortmund double can help guide liverpools second album","story":"Critics are already out in force after Liverpool lost to City but the German is well practised in ignoring knee-jerk judgmentsLiverpool have lost three games in the past two Premier League seasons, but as the most recent defeat was by four goals it has already been suggested that the new champions have been enjoying their title success a little too much.Jürgen Klopp has heard it all before. Not on Merseyside, where he has just delivered the first title since 1990, but in his native Germany, where he followed up his unexpected Bundesliga title with Borussia Dortmund in 2011 with an even more unlikely retention a year later. “We didn’t do anything different the second season, all we did was continue to train hard and try to keep improving,” the Liverpool manager said.“We weren’t expecting to win the league again and we didn’t start the season too well. We lost three times in our first six games and the media was coming out with all the usual rubbish, we had lost our focus, we were still celebrating.Klopp is not necessarily anticipating the same thing happening to Liverpool next season, though he is aware the remainder of this season will attract close scrutiny after Thursday’s defeat by Manchester City.“The circumstances were a little strange,” he said. “Straight after winning the league we had to play one of the best teams in the world. They had nothing to lose, we had nothing to win. We had no right to expect to win after giving away four goals, but we did have three chances to score that normally we would have taken.“I try not to worry too much about things I can’t change, and I certainly can’t change the City result now, I can only try to use it for the next game.”Aston Villa are the visitors to Anfield on Sunday afternoon and, though they are separated from City by almost the length of the league, Klopp not only has a vivid recollection of the scare at Villa Park in November when late goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mané turned a likely defeat into victory, a key result. “The guys in this team are exceptional characters, and that was one of the games that showed it,” he said.“There is still a lot to play for this season without thinking of next and I am confident these boys will go again. I don’t have to be told whether my players are ready for the next challenge, I can see it in their eyes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891d0a67418d6c94ae3673cf0071b1c999b11657/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83bafa3e8f2714e57f1ac19b3eb87300","title":"kale to kimchi 12 foods that are good for gut health","story":"The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gutWe’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose impact on our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf479be0a5b8ca436ddcd7e6e5c0b586a4c25edf/0_195_5835_3504/master/5835.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=16b0bcebd5f90fa9fcbc60d91f145eeb","title":"gloria steinem unless you are going too far you are not going far enough","story":"The feminist activist, 86, on worldwide sisterhood, Spaceship Earth, sexual harrassment in the 1970s and being bitten by ratsMy parents were kind and funny and taught me that kindness and a sense of humour are invaluable. Much later, I learned that in the oldest cultures laughter is the only free emotion. Obviously, fear can be compelled. So can love, if we’re dependent for long enough, we enmesh even with a captor in order to survive. But you can’t compel laughter. It’s a flash of recognition. Never go anywhere you’re not allowed to laugh, including church.I became a grown-up too early, from 10 to 17, a small person responsible for a big person. My mother was ill and often couldn’t look after herself. I never knew what I would find when I got home. Since then I’ve had friends who were the children of alcoholics, and I’ve learned we share some of the same feelings.One of my lowest points was waking up on a summer night with a pool of blood on the floor. My hand had been extended over the bed and I’d been bitten by a rat. My mother got me to a local hospital for a tetanus shot, but when we came home the pool of blood had been licked up. I remember longing for a cage to sleep in. I say this because in cities around the world, there are people living with the same fear right now.The boys in my neighbourhood dreamed of getting out through sports, but the only place I saw women leading free lives was in the movies. So I had the dream of becoming a dancer and literally dancing my way into a better life and world. In high school, I answered an ad and became a magician’s assistant. Briefly, because he left town with the money he was supposed to pay me and a young couple who sang with his act.The women’s movement feels like a big chosen family. From New York to New Delhi, I can find women friends I trust as family. We are communal animals, so it’s important to have the support of others: friends, colleagues, lovers for company and laughter, a rescuer if I’m in trouble, a will to help if they need it.I’m so excited by young women now. Remember, I was a 50s person, so I feel as if I just had to wait for some of my friends to be born. We’ve always been accused of “going too far”. That’s why Robin Morgan wrote a brilliant book with that title. Unless you’re accused of that, you haven’t gone far enough!What we now call the #MeToo movement started in the early 1970s, when women college students first coined the term “sexual harassment” to describe what happened to them on summer jobs. Then the great legal mind, Catharine MacKinnon, wrote this into sex discrimination law. Several cases were brought, all by black women, and there were the Anita Hill hearings that educated the nation. Recently, women have begun to feel OK about coming forward to say that our bodies belong to ourselves. We have yet to explain that there’s no democracy without power over our own bodies.Seeing New York shut down is sad and frightening, yet there’s also a new sense of concern and connection between and among us.

They can see it around them. The furlough scheme has touched every community.”Boris Johnson told the Evening Standard on Friday that the job retention scheme was “keeping people in suspended animation” and must end in October.Employers are being asked to make a progressively larger contribution to the costs of the scheme over the summer months. It is unclear whether alternative forms of support will be put in place to extend the help for hard-hit sectors such as hospitality or the arts.Reynolds said: “There should definitely be flexibility on the furlough scheme. That’s the biggest difference you could make. Extending it beyond the date that has been given, and recognising that some sectors can’t possibly make a contribution at this stage.”He was scathing about the government’s decision to reintroduce benefits sanctions, which have been suspended during the crisis. It means claimants can again be financially penalised if they miss appointments.“Unemployment is high, vacancies are down, the schools aren’t back, people are shielding – the idea that the answer to that is to dock people’s social support because they’re not out looking for jobs … it just looks unthinkable,” he said.Confirmation that sanctions were being restored only came after Reynolds asked the question of his opposite number, Thérèse Coffey, in the House of Commons.As well as extending the job retention scheme, Reynolds urged the government to introduce something like the Future Jobs Fund, the programme drawn up by Labour during the 2008 financial crisis, which created 100,000 taxpayer-funded jobs for unemployed 18- to 24-year-olds.Johnson has said young people will be offered an “opportunity guarantee”, giving them the chance of a work placement or apprenticeship but it is unclear how this will be achieved.Reynolds claimed Johnson’s cabinet may be failing to grasp the gravity of the situation because “a lot of people in government are just so far removed from people who are going to be looking for jobs”.He said: “Politicians often overstate their memories of what it was like when they were growing up, but in the north-east in the 1980s – the miners’ strike, the shipyard closures – my sense of unemployment being the biggest problem around is definitely one I have from childhood.“And I think we know that if you’re unemployed during a crisis, the impact of that in years to come, you never really recover. It has such a scarring impact.”As the man with the job of drawing up Labour’s benefits policy for the next general election, Reynolds argues that the pandemic should be a “Beveridge moment” for the welfare state.Sunak poured £7bn into uprating universal credit and working tax credit payments in March, in what Reynolds says was an implicit acknowledgement that the safety net was inadequate.The government was also forced to create “whole new pillars of support” in the form of the job retention scheme and the self-employment support scheme because the generous “wage replacement” systems that exist in some other countries were not there, he said.“You’ve seen even the government say: ‘The system we’ve got isn’t going to get us through this crisis,’” Reynolds said.Reynolds first won his Stalybridge and Hyde seat in 2010, just as Labour lost power after 13 years. Before that he had worked for his predecessor in the seat, James Purnell.He has held a series of frontbench jobs since then, including rejoining Jeremy Corbyn’s team as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury after Corbyn saw off Owen Smith’s leadership challenge in 2016.After Corbyn stepped aside in April, Reynolds was one of several younger MPs handed prominent roles by Keir Starmer. He turns 40 next month.Like his frontbench colleagues Nick Thomas-Symonds and Annaliese Dodds – Starmer’s shadow home secretary and chancellor respectively – Reynolds has a reputation among colleagues for being clever, hard-working and unshowy.He has previously flirted with ideas considered radical in Labour, including striking electoral pacts with other left-of-centre parties in a so-called “progressive alliance”.His views on the future of the welfare state are being closely scrutinised by the Labour left for clues as to whether Starmer will abandon aspects of Corbyn’s legacy.Asked whether he stood by Labour’s promise to replace the universal credit system, Reynolds said: “We use the language of full replacement, because we are clearly opposed to some of the features of it, like the two-child limit and the benefit cap, and we feel the brand is too tarnished. And also we reject the ethos behind it – that punitive, stick-based system.”But he conceded that any new system would share key features with UC, including bundling once separate benefits into a single payment. “I’m listening to what people say, but my instincts are: because of the lack of a legacy system to go back to, there are merits in combining particularly out-of-work support and in-work support and housing benefit at the same time.” And it would make sense to bundle council tax benefit into the same payment, he added.Reynolds has previously expressed interest in the fashionable idea of a universal basic income – a flat-rate payment made to everyone. But he said there was no “magic wand” to resolve the complex challenges the welfare system needs to meet.“UBI comes up a lot in conversations with members. I’ve always been interested in it because I don’t like means-testing, and I think there’s something in that,” he said. But he warned that the idea faced “two very significant conceptual problems that might be so big they don’t have answers”: how to treat disabled people in the system, “because obviously disabled people need more support and they should get it” and the wide variation in housing costs across the country caused by the dysfunctional housing market.He said Labour had “struggled” politically on welfare in the decade he has been in parliament, as the Conservatives imposed successive waves of benefits cuts. “It was George Osborne who was in the ascendancy after 2010 and we were reacting to it,” he said, referring to the former chancellor’s language of “strivers” and “skivers”.“The biggest problem about that Osborne language, apart from the fact it’s offensive about people, is that it attempts to ide people into a group of people who pay for the system and a group of people who pay for the support,” he said.“It was good politics for the Conservative party – you’d hear those words sometimes repeated back at you when you were canvassing – but it has left us fundamentally with a safety net that wouldn’t have got us through a crisis like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

The life in which I didn’t develop anxiety and agoraphobia.In 1995, aged 23, after years of auditions, my application had been accepted for the Royal Welsh College of Music \u0026amp Drama. My desire to act since the age of eight was firmly cemented and my dreams were coming to fruition. I was living in London so I’d arranged some viewings of potential digs. My boyfriend and I decided to make a trip of it and planned an extended scenic route – a concept now incomprehensible. But by the time we left, I was getting nervous.Anxiety and I were no strangers. At 20, my life became one long panic attack. Ironically, I was more likely to experience claustrophobia at this point and I’d frequently head to London’s West End for relief from my anxiety. But by the time I was off to drama school, I was feeling better, thanks to some CBT and beta-blockers. I was confident it was all behind me and excited about what lay ahead. The nerves I experienced that day, as everyone assured me, were normal.We headed down the motorway – music loud, chatting me eating the cheese and piccalilli sandwiches we’d packed for the journey. But I’d barely finished the last one when I had the mother of all panic attacks and they made a reappearance over my boyfriend’s van.That was the moment my world shrunk smaller than the set of The Truman Show. The moment I became agoraphobic. And 25 years later – I still am.It’s a misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces. Though the word originates from the Greek for “fear of the market square”, according to the NHS website it is “a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn’t be available if things go wrong”. Although true, that is a simplistic description of a complex beast whose manifestation is particular to each person. It can morph and shapeshift. Worlds can shrink and enlarge like pufferfish. But generally (though not always) it’s an unfortunate upgrade from the already debilitating panic disorder. It’s the promotion no one wants. At its core, it’s a phobia of having panic attacks (a very real, terrifying physical reaction) in triggering situations, leading to avoidance. It is, ultimately, a fear of fear.When not in the throes of a deadly pandemic, I do go out. Agoraphobics are not all housebound – that’s another fallacy. I love going out and about. But I’ve also developed an irrational system of imagined borders that depict where I can and cannot go.Please don’t expect it to make sense. That’s the whole point. It doesn’t. On one hand, I’m a rational person who friends come to for solid advice someone who’s been a director of a company for 20 years and who has written a novel. On the other, I think I may die because I’ve passed through the traffic lights on Liverpool Road, crossing the line of my invisible boundary.The reasoning behind choosing the “safe” areas is also illogical. Some nearer destinations are out of bounds or a scarier prospect than somewhere further yet familiar. But to clarify, none are far from my house. I’m trapped within the constraints of my hometown – the only occasion where the term “Madchester” would be acceptable. My restrictions aren’t limited to the where but also the when. The only thing worse than a journey is a journey with bad traffic. The vision of red brake lights ahead is a certain trigger. Overheating, nausea, dizziness, palpitations and derealisation are all exacerbated by the fact I can’t escape.Of course, this isn’t a continual state. If you met me, you probably wouldn’t suspect any of this. Most of the time I even forget I’m like this myself. Until I receive an invitation to something I’d like to attend. If it’s outside where I feel comfortable, I contemplate if it’s manageable. I investigate, gather further information, such as parking and other events happening that would increase traffic. Whereas the average person may think, “Oh yes, I’m meeting such-and-such in half an hour,” I would have to practise beforehand, attempt missions to the destination some successful, some failed.Hopefully, the invite would be a casual one with no pressure. But if someone is relying on me or travelling a distance, my worries intensify, forcing me to add multiple disclaimers and caveats. I am certain I’m considered flaky or selfish, but the reality is the opposite. I don’t want to let people down. So, more often than not I reject the offer despite my desperation to go and the reality being that most likely I’d have been fine.Imagine what it’s like dating. I’ve had relationships. I’ve been in love. But I also appreciate it’s difficult for the other person. When talking to potentials online, I dread making the announcement. But then that can create a horrifying lead-up where I declare that there is something so awful about me I need to tell them, that when I do, they’re usually just relieved I’m not a convicted killer. The catch-22 is that being with someone helps. I feel safer with a person I trust and love someone who would be there for me if I collapsed in M\u0026ampS, which in turn would reassure me that I wouldn’t collapse in M\u0026ampS.My mum was my safety person. I could even travel from London to Manchester with her and go to the seaside. When she died five years ago, followed by my dad a few months later, it wasn’t just agonising grief I was dealing with, but my capacity to negotiate the world had gone, too. The pufferfish deflated to the size of an anchovy. I was metaphorically cast adrift, with the additional misfortune of potentially never being able to see the sea again.What about now? At the beginning of March, I started self-lockdown before the lockdown was a thing. Panic disorder, agoraphobia and Covid-19 is quite the cocktail that on a menu would be called “The Life Ruiner”. Going outside was no longer an option. For the first few weeks, my anxiety rocketed, culminating in continual panic attacks and more hand washing than Lady Macbeth. Irrational fears I’ve carried for 25 years became a reality. Going out had a tangible threat. A friend rang me when lockdown came into force and said, “You’ve been waiting for this moment your whole life.”But the fact is, the majority are worried about the virus. I see tweets from people experiencing anxiety for the first time, and even agoraphobia. A friend recently had his first panic attack. It’s strange being more on a level with the norm. If you’re suffering, I can assure you, it is transient. No state of panic or anxiety is sustainable. Yes, my overall disorder has lasted, but it’s not consistent, otherwise I’d now be living at Warwick Service Station after once having an episode there, convinced I could neither continue the journey, nor go back home.The pandemic has forced us to reassess our lives. I wonder if this will be the turning point for me: an extreme-exposure therapy session. I long for the weight to be lifted. When I imagine it is all over, going places doesn’t seem a scary prospect any more. The simple fact of not potentially contracting a deadly virus would make a jaunt to Manchester city centre a total breeze. For the first time in a long while I am optimistic.Yes, life with anxiety and agoraphobia is excruciating at times. It’s often saddening and exhausting and frustrating. But I don’t look back and wish it had all been different because, well, what’s the point in that? Contrary to what some believe, it’s not a choice. I’d rather laugh at its absurdity and remain hopeful it will change for the better while making peace with the fact it may not.Going back to that day in 1995 – if I’d made the journey and attended drama school, the highlights of my career could have been a bit part on Casualty followed by a panto run in Blackpool. I wouldn’t have made the friends I have or experienced the same relationships. If I hadn’t had endless therapy, I wouldn’t understand the complexities of humans to the extent I do, enabling me to write my book. And as for Louis Theroux – well, we’re all allowed one regret.If I Can’t Have You by Charlotte Levin is published on 9 July (£14.99, Mantle).

In theory, they sacrifice themselves for the good of everyone else, setting an even tempo through the first two-thirds of a race, strong but not too strong, so the good horses settle down in the early stages before quickening past in the straight to seize the glory that is rightfully theirs.But, as chess players know, every piece in play deserves respect. Left unchallenged, any pawn can go the length of the board and become a queen. When the entries were made for this Derby last Thursday, Serpentine was widely imagined to be no more than a foot soldier in Aidan O’Brien’s army, present only to set things up for his betters, but they paid dearly for underestimating him and now he wears the crown.It has happened before and not that long ago. This race was an uncanny echo of last year’s Irish Derby, when the O’Brien-trained Sovereign made almost every yard to win by six lengths at 33-1. He was supposed to be a pacemaker for Anthony Van Dyck, the Epsom victor three weeks before, but, as with Saturday’s race, it was clear by the turn into the straight the other jockeys had made a disastrous miscalculation and the one in front had gone beyond recall.Punters tend to get very steamed up about this kind of outcome, which is hardly to be wondered at. You spend hours poring over the form and watching replays in the hope of identifying the best horse and then see the race fall to an outsider benefiting, on the face of it, from the misjudgment of his rivals.But, when we have all taken a deep breath and perhaps had a restorative beverage, this kind of thing has to be accepted as part of the game. The rules, after all, require every horse to run on its own merits, to be trying to win for itself. What could be better proof of those rules being upheld than a pacemaker that keeps on keeping on?Long memories are rewarded in racing, which is also as it should be. Derby heroes have made all, or almost all, before now. Steve Cauthen went straight to the front on his two winners, Reference Point and Slip Anchor, back in the 80s, as the more ancient punters will recall.The long-retired jockey Richard Hills was particularly good at this sort of thing. He pinched the QEII Stakes not once but twice on supposed pacemakers.Maroof was the first, back in 1994, when he was the only one of the nine runners that had not won a top-class race. In fact, he had not won anything for a year and was allowed to go off at 66-1, but Hills judged things to a nicety and was still clear at the line.Back in third place that day on Bigstone was a young Frankie Dettori, who may have been having flashbacks as he asked English King to close the impossible gap here on Saturday.Seven years after Maroof, Hills was at it again on the 33-1 shot Summoner, teeing things up (but actually not) for his Godolphin stablemate Noverre. Soft ground played its part in beating the favourite that day.“It’s just one of those things,” the once-more disappointed Dettori said after climbing off Noverre back in 2001, voicing the phlegmatism to which we must all aspire. “Life goes on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee76af9fbee4a635d1ad4f44a05a7a274047fa69/0_441_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2728a144feb817878d6d68a65b2b55f0","title":"waiting in the wings theatres in lockdown","story":"Throughout June, photographer Joanna Vestey photographed the caretakers of 20 closed London theatres, in situ, for a project titled Custodians for Covid.

North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Alaska, Missouri, Idaho and Alabama also registered new daily highs. Texas also hit a new peak for hospitalisations.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland who released the daily figure for Friday, the US has now recorded more than 2.8m cases of Covid-19 and nearly 130,000 deaths.Trump claimed: “We were doing better than any country had done in history ... and then we got hit with this terrible plague from China and now we’re getting closer to fighting our way out of it.”In fact, records show Covid-19 cases are rising in 37 states and falling significantly in only one, Vermont.Trump continued: “Our country is coming back, our jobs numbers are spectacular, a lot of things are happening that people don’t quite see yet. We’re on our way to a tremendous victory. It’s going to happen and it’s going to happen big. Our country will be greater than ever before.”On Thursday, the federal jobs report showed a surge in hiring. Experts cautioned that the numbers were drawn from the beginning of economic reopening, before a consequent surge in cases.On Twitter on Saturday, Trump repeated his claim that “if we didn’t test so much and so successfully, we would have very few cases”, and said: “In the meantime, deaths and the all important mortality rate goes down.”Experts say the US mortality rate has fallen due to testing, treatment and the age and health profile of those now being infected. Any increase in mortality would be expected to lag behind a rise in diagnoses.Joe Biden, Trump’s opponent in the presidential election in November, also released a message marking the holiday. Discussing civil unrest over police brutality and structural racism – protests which inspired Trump’s claims about “far-left fascism” in a speech at Mount Rushmore on Friday – Biden promised to win “a battle for the soul of this nation”.On Twitter, the former vice-president added: “This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.”Masks were optional at the Trump event in South Dakota, where social distancing was not in evidence. As Trump spoke, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a senior campaign official and Donald Trump Jr’s girlfriend, was reported to have tested positive for the virus.It was reported that face coverings would be available at the White House on Saturday night, when Trump was due to hold another holiday celebration. Preparations for the event included socially distanced chairs seen on the South Lawn.According to a report from CNN, meanwhile, the White House has denied public health leaders permission to appear on television and speak on behalf of the federal government about steps to contain the coronavirus.One anonymous official said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was thought too blunt about the dangers of Covid-19, or too “doom and gloom”.Earlier this week, Fauci testified before a Senate committee, an appearance broadcast on TV. He delivered a sobering message: that the US could soon see 100,000 new cases a day and that the death toll “is going to be very disturbing”.Since then, in states including Texas and Florida, hospitals have continued to fill and reopening measures have been rescinded. States which suffered at the beginning of the outbreak, New York prominent among them, are also slowing reopening.In March and April, as cases surged on the east coast and elsewhere, members of the White House taskforce on Covid-19 were familiar figures on TV. Fauci in particular won praise for his calm and no-nonsense advice, which often stood in contrast to speculative and confused messaging from Trump himself.But Fauci last appeared spoke directly to US TV networks on 12 June. According to CNN, he and other prominent members of the taskforce, such as Drs Deborah Birx and Robert Redfield, now rarely grant TV interviews. The anonymous source told CNN officials have been unable to gain permission to appear even though “now is the time to be sending a strong public health message”.Even figures seen as more amenable to the administration’s aims have struggled for airtime. The surgeon general, Dr Jerome Adams, has made just two broadcast appearances in the last few weeks, one on local radio and the other on NBC on Friday. There, Adams was asked about Trump’s decision not to wear a mask in public.“Every single person has to make up their own mind,” he said.Alex Azar, the health secretary, has appeared on most major networks in the last few weeks. Fauci, CNN said, has been appearing on media less used by the White House, such as podcasts and foreign broadcasts.On Friday, NBC reported that the White House is preparing to change its messaging on the coronavirus, to tell Americans it simply has to be lived with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f616a57fa59d157df5bbfa56d8e3611411c64253/0_104_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9fbf513a7f58c2a5bfa3682b8ccbcde","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056..

A woman stood before him, asking to borrow space in the church car park for a removal van. They chatted, France-Williams gave permission, and she thanked him.Now, says France-Williams, “All of a sudden I’ve become Mr Popular.” In the past few weeks, a number of clergy colleagues have consulted him on their responses to the Black Lives Matter movement. “I’ve had panicking bishops wanting me to write their statements,” he tells the Observer.Next week, almost 10 years to the day since France-Williams was ordained as a priest in the Church of England, his book on his and others’ experiences as black and minority ethnic clergy will be published. Ghost Ship: Institutional Racism and the Church of England has “the potential to be a bit of a wrecking ball, to make a crack in the wall of racism that surrounds us,” he says.Before he became a priest, France-Williams was asked to conduct a survey among BAME people attending the church where he was a youth worker after some asked why their experiences were not reflected in services. He presented the vicar with the results and some recommendations.“He glanced at them, dropped the paper in his in-tray, and said ‘now is the time for unity, not ersity’. That was the end of the conversation. We’re asked to share our stories over and over, to pour out our thoughts and pain, and it never goes anywhere.”As a trainee priest and then a curate, he became increasingly aware of unconscious bias within the church and the barriers in the way of BAME clergy. “There’s a kind of cognitive dissonance – you don’t want to believe that racism is real. But I began to realise that there is a culture that seeks to box you in.”The last few weeks have suggested to him that “white friends and colleagues are starting to listen. I’ve had a number contact me to apologise for the times they’ve been complicit.”The recent suggestion from Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, that the church should rethink the portrayal of Jesus as white was welcome, says France-Williams. “He acknowledged coded cultural norms that are oppressive. Now there is talk of re-examining statues and images in churches and cathedrals – of holding up a mirror to the church.”In the past two weeks, C of E bishops announced a new commission to “drive forward ‘bold changes’ to ensure racial equality – a move greeted with scepticism by some who have seen previous task forces and inquiries come and go with little actual change.France-Williams would like this commission to have guaranteed and generous funding, and to involve people from outside the church. “It needs to have the freedom to challenge the church not to be a private members’ club. It needs agency and to set its own agenda.”Efforts to increase the number of BAME people entering the priesthood has had good results, he says. But, he adds, “You can have as many as you want, but unless the structure is such that they can flourish, where their black lives matter, it’s just more people who are going to be suffering.”He talks of “a game of snakes and ladders” played with people. “You roll the dice, take a few steps, you have the exhilaration of mounting the ladder, then you roll the dice again and you slide back down. And this happens time and time again.“This current wave of racial awareness feels like a massive ladder – we’ve gone right up there. But the realist in me says, does this just mean there will be a longer snake slide down?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86621137c148c1264cc1f0034522754fb366c21/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ffb5c72725edefc60d1e3bcd5c1acfb","title":"englands post lockdown newlyweds toast surreal day over zoom","story":"Couple swaps big plans for low-key ceremony as weddings are allowed to go ahead for the first time in monthsAfter three missed hen dos, one lost wedding dress and a guest list savagely trimmed by four fifths, Fiona Sharples and Chris Fisher tied the knot on Saturday in one of the UK’s first post-lockdown weddings.Kissing outside St Kenelm church in Gloucestershire – unaccompanied by banned confetti – the happy couple said it had been a dream day. Albeit, said Sharples, if that dream was “surreal and exciting and set our heads spinning.”While an estimated 75,000 UK weddings have been postponed in the last three months, dozens of couples across England decided to celebrate the end of lockdown with their nuptials. Ceremonies adhered to strict rules: no more than 30 attendees, including staff and the registrar, no food or drink unless it was essential for the ceremony and a soft ban on singing and instruments to limit the spread of the virus. Social distancing rather than tipsy flirting was the order of the day.“We’ve winged it,” said Sharples over videocall, the night before the wedding. “All the things you thought were essentials have gone out of the window. Chris is getting married in jeans and Converse. I only just managed to buy my wedding shoes in Asda. Bridal underwear? Forget it.”The couple, both 34, met on a dating site eight years ago and have two children together. Fisher, a chef, proposed to Sharples, who works as a community nurse, over a Chinese takeaway in Watchet Harbour, Somerset, last summer. When they originally decided on a 4 July wedding – a date sandwiched between their two birthdays – they had envisaged a big sunny party with around 150 people, a picnic, a disco and massive marquee. In the end, they had four days to throw the event together.A wedding dress had been dispatched but did not arrive on time. Sharples was beaming nonetheless: “I’m happy with my old faithful dress”. The day had been “hectic but lovely”. The couple were looking forward to settling down to a wedding tea served by the local chippy and a bottle of prosecco drunk over Zoom while chatting to family.“People have been really wonderful, we’re lucky to have lots of loved ones helping us,” she said. “I very nearly lost my life in March to Sepsis, and sent my friends off to have my hen do in this big house in Devon without me. We tried to rearrange two different things since then but they got waylaid too.” Sharples shrugged.“Basically, life’s too short,” said Fisher. “We didn’t have time to think too much about whether we should do the wedding this weekend – it will be more intimate but it’s been taken out of our hands.”In the longer term, wedding planner Alice Higgins predicts that the industry will be adapting at pace: excess and frippery were out, she says, and a focus on low-key simplicity will become a more established norm in ceremonies to come.“Weddings are wonderful occasions but they can get overwhelming and that is not how it should be,” she said. “It’s easy for couples to get caught up in the wedding whirlwind, but the Covid situation has made people really focus on stripping back to what is important to them and remembering the wedding is only the start of it – the marriage is what really matters.”As for Mr and Mrs Fisher, their planned honeymoon was cancelled but an unromantic weekend with their children, Albert, 4, and two-year-old Mallory, in CBeebies Land beckoned. “So instead of going on our cruise and having two weeks of child-free romance in Croatia and Italy, we’ve got two nights booked in an Octonaughts-themed room instead,” said Fiona. The couple giggled. “There will probably be a comedown from all this,” said Chris, “but I don’t think anything will really change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1139fb4487225aa5566becb7ec1e419f10ec80/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f80794cc627ac7b780efa1e62fa3016","title":"hidden language hong kong security law residents wordplay","story":"Residents use wordplay including repurposed Chinese Communist party dogma to express frustration Hongkongers are finding creative ways to voice dissent after Beijing blanketed the city in a new security law and police began arresting people displaying now forbidden political slogans.Faced with the sudden threat of prosecution for anything that might promote greater autonomy or independence for the restless city, residents are using wordplay and even subverting Chinese Communist party dogma to express their frustration.On a bridge in the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay, a popular spot for pro-democracy protests over the past year, traffic thunders past fresh graffiti that says: “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves.”The phrase is taken from the first line of China’s national anthem. While the graffiti could conceivably have been written by a patriotic nationalist, it is most likely a declaration of dissent.Social media and chat forums have filled with suggestions for how to find safer ways to protest after Beijing on Tuesday imposed broad legislation banning subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion.In a semi-autonomous city used to speaking its mind, people would find ways around the law, said Chan Kin-man, a veteran democracy activist who has previously been jailed for his activism.He said: “In a public space, one might either not say anything or use an ’officially-approved’ language to protect themselves. But hidden language is something that cannot be banned by laws.”The local government on Thursday said the popular protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” would now be deemed illegal.For some the phrase represents genuine aspirations to split Hong Kong from China, a red line for Beijing, but for many others it is a more general cry for democracy and an expression of rising frustration with Chinese rule.But coded language is allowing people to keep the slogan alive. One version “GFHG, SDGM” uses English letters from the transliterated phrase “gwong fuk heung gong, si doi gak ming”. Another more complex example mimics the tone and rhythm of the slogan using the numbers “3219 0246” in Cantonese.Chinese characters themselves also provide ample room for linguistic subversion. One phrase people have started adopting online is “seize back banana”, a play on the similar characters in traditional Chinese for Hong Kong and banana.Others have gone for English slogans that appear positive but are a clear dig at Beijing – for example the Trumpian phraseL “Make Hong Kong great”.The first arrest made under the new security law involved a deliberate linguistic challenge. During protests a day after the law was enacted, police announced they had arrested a man with a flag that read “Hong Kong independence”, posting a picture.But attentive web users zoomed in on the flag and spotted that a man had written a small “No” before his much larger phrase.Multiple pro-democracy restaurants and shops across the city have taken down their “Lennon Wall” displays expressing support for the pro-democracy movement after police told people they might violate the national security law.The walls are often made up of colourful sticky notes with protest slogans on them.One cafe replaced its wall with blank memos. “What is essential is invisible to the eyes,” the shop wrote on its Facebook page, citing children’s book Le Petit Prince.Another symbol of defiance that has replaced some protest art across the city is blank white pages. The gesture represents the inability to speak out and also “white terror”, a Chinese phrase used to describe political persecution.“Suppression catalyses people to fight back,” said Chan, who is also a sociology professor. He likened the situation to how people in mainland China reveal dissent or anger towards the government with a wink and a nod.“Hong Kong people will definitely respond more actively, it’s just that it might happen in a grey area,” he said.A slogan that went viral this week was a quote by Mao Zedong: “Those who suppress the student movements will not come to a good end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0087d60aa7750112c1867c2d9bf695d8b37e38/0_37_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b40c7411269306e97e1352b46cdb0aed","title":"lets do karaoke bangkok nightlife eases out of lockdown","story":"The city’s bars, clubs and even massage parlours are beginning to buzz again but the absence of tourists is taking its tollA mix of K-pop, sweet Thai love ballads and 90s music reverberates along the corridor of one of Bangkok’s popular karaoke spots. In private rooms, parties of friends strike poses and bellow into microphones.After three months of silence, Thailand’s nightlife was allowed to reopen on 1 July – provided venues follow government rules to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “You can dance, as long as you keep a distance from your friends,” explains Planisara Suksit, branch manager of Yes!! R\u0026ampB Karaoke in Thonglor, her voice muffled by a face mask and plastic shield.The business reopened for the first time on Friday night, operating at reduced capacity as staff rolled out new disease-control measures. Only smaller groups are allowed to book a room, guests’ temperatures are scanned, and everyone must check in through a government tracing system on their mobiles. Signs urge guests not to sit too close together. Protective covers to place over microphones are handed out.Everything is disinfected regularly, adds Planisara. “It’s quite a big piece of work because the decoration material in each room is different,” she says. Each space has a different theme – from likay, a form of Thai folk theatre, to a room packed with more than 100 teddy bears, some of which have been removed as a precaution.Businesses, and the hundreds of thousands of people working in the nightlife industry, hope the sector will start to recover. It’s not possible to even think about profits yet, says Planisara. For now, the focus is adjusting to the new normal.Social distancing will prove easier for some outlets than others. The government has allowed not just karaoke but also bars, clubs and massage parlours to reopen, and issued rules for each. Beer pitchers and singing while seated are not allowed, nor is dancing near tables in pubs and bars. In the red-light district, performers wear masks on stage, and must keep a distance from customers. Staff who provide a “soapy massage” must wear a mask, as should customers, except during bathing, the regulations state.The country has managed to avoid a major outbreak, recording 3,185 cases and 58 deaths. But the economic impact of the lockdown has been devastating – especially for vulnerable groups such as sex workers, who rely on tourists for work. Service Workers in Group, which supports sex workers, warns some have been turned away for welfare support. Prostitution is illegal in Thailand, though it is tolerated.It’s feared that poverty rates, which have already worsened in recent years, will rise even further. Nopadon Khanklai, a taxi driver in Bangkok, was forced to sell his car during lockdown because as work dried up, he couldn’t afford the credit payments.“I came to a point where I had to go to the temple to ask for food. If it’s not for the temple I would have died. I had no money,” he says. Now that nightlife has reopened, he has begun driving a rented car, but this costs 700 baht (£18) per day to hire, on top of fuel. It’s hard to break even. He hopes tourists will come back soon, but worries about the risk of travellers bringing Covid-19 into the country.Though travel bubbles with low-risk countries are being discussed by officials, borders remain shut to tourists. The country has recorded no local cases for more than five weeks, but venues have been warned that they will be closed if they break coronavirus rules.“We try, we try,” says one business owner, who asked not to be named, but he acknowledges that it’s a challenge. At the bar, drinkers brush up against one another. Outside, groups huddle together to chat and take photos.Maybe some people are feeling more confident because Thailand has recorded fewer cases recently, says Krittapart Ngernkao, a graphic designer, who has been out with friends.Krittapart is still taking precautions, and says he probably won’t go out partying as often as before the coronavirus hit. But staying at home on Friday, the first day nightlife reopened, was simply not an option, he added. “We have been waiting to come out, we have been waiting for some joy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d61264b1960660e970c55aff1d08438c7130072/0_236_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b249d3fe4fe486dc8effe86e0ab580ed","title":"melbournes hard lockdown orders residents of nine public housing towers to stay home as coronavirus cases surge","story":"Five hundred police sent to enforce command that 3,000 tenants remain in their unitsThree thousand people living in nine public housing towers in Melbourne have been placed under the harshest lockdown rules of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia so far and banned from leaving their homes for at least five days.The Victorian government’s decision to lock down all nine towers was made because of “patterns of movement, friendship groups, family groups,” the premier said.Daniel Andrews also cited the crowded living in public housing and many communal spaces, meaning community transmission was high risk.Five hundred police officers have been dispatched to monitor the nine towers in Flemington and North Melbourne and ensure that the residents do not leave their small and often overcrowded units.Residents living in the flats are among the most vulnerable and heavily policed people in the state of Victoria, with a high population of new migrants, Indigenous people, people experiencing severe mental illness and people who have experienced family violence or homelessness.Residents told  Australia they felt “singled out” by the lockdown order, which was implemented with no warning at 4pm, and “intimidated” by the large police presence.Andrews, announced the “hard lockdown” of the nine towers late on Saturday, at the same time as he announced that two new postcodes – 3031 and 3051, taking in Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne, and Hotham Hill – would be placed under stage-three stay-at-home orders from midnight.The difference between the more than 300,000 people in Melbourne under the stage-three orders, and the nine towersis that those under stay-at-home orders can leave their homes to exercise, do grocery shopping, conduct essential caregiving and attend work or study if they cannot do so remotely.Those living in the towers cannot.“If you’re in one of those towers the minister has just read out, you will not be allowed to leave your unit, your dwelling within that tower, for any reason,” Andrews said.He said the lockdown would be in place for at least five days, because that was how long health officials estimated it would take to test every single resident in those units, and get the test results back. But the lockdown could last 14 days, he said.There are more than 1,300 units in the nine towers. Residents were not forewarned before the premier made the announcement and police arrived at their door. Andrews said the state government would be arranging for food, healthcare and other essential services to be delivered to the residents, but the details of how that will work have not been announced or discussed with residents.The housing minister, Richard Wynne, said people living in these public housing towers were “some of the most vulnerable people in our community”.“Many of them are subject to co-morbidities and we want to ensure that we wrap around them all of the services that they are going to need, not just over the next five days or indeed potentially the next 14 days, but going forward that we provide them with all of the support they need to maintain their tenancy but obviously to maintain their wellness also,” Wynne said.But no social workers or other support services were observed outside the tower blocks in Flemington on Saturday night – only armed police officers wearing gloves and face masks.Hana, who shares a three-bedroom flat in one of the Racecourse Road towers with her mother and sister, said she had returned from grocery shopping just after 4pm to be met by an “intimidating” police presence.“I was just shocked,” she said. “I thought, I don’t know, it seemed like there was some criminal activity or something, like a stabbing or something … I asked, ‘What’s happened?’ and they said, ‘Oh, there’s an outbreak. You can’t leave your house. Just park your car, you can’t leave your house.’”Hana said it was unfair that the public housing blocks had been locked down when other large apartment buildings in the area had not, and also unfair that they had not been given any warning.“You had other suburbs where they had 48 hours warning before they were put in lockdown,” she said. “How come we are any different? It just feels like we have been singled out.”Another woman, who lives in the tower block at 129 Racecourse Road, Flemington, said she had received a text message while she was at the supermarket telling her not to leave her home.She said she was concerned for her grandmother, who lives in a neighbouring block and requires visits from carers several times a day.“I’m actually a bit worried about my gran because she has carers coming to feed her daily … and I don’t know what’s going to happen with the carers now and who’s going to be feeding my grandma,” she said. “So I am hoping they have got that organised … she needs to be fed today.”She said she had expected the tower to be locked down “at some point”.Most people living there had been trying to self-isolate, she said, but with shared amenities that was impossible.“It’s still down to the elevators, which are shared, our laundry, which is shared, and even where put our rubbish, there’s a handle that we all have to keep touching to lift,” she said.“So it was going to go around the flats ... I am glad that we’re trying to limit it as much as possible but … I am not sure how they are going to handle this because this is the first time it happens here. Are we going to go through this every three or four weeks? Because that’s going to drive us insane.”Australia’s acting chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said the public housing lockdown was “unprecedented”. Both he and Andrews compared it to the lockdown of an aged care home once an outbreak had been detected.Kelly said while these steps are unprecedented, given the vulnerability of many people living in the towers, to do anything else would be contrary to public health advice.The extension of the lockdown to 12 postcodes from 10 was made on the back of Victoria recording 108 new cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours, the highest single-day increase in the state’s figures since the national daily incidence peak on 28 March.Those new cases include 23 people who live in the nine public housing towers but Victoria’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said there were “hundreds” of high-risk close contacts spread across the towers. If they were not locked down, she said, it would risk an “explosion” of new cases among vulnerable people living in housing estates.Nationally, Australia recorded 113 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours. New South Wales reported five cases in hotel quarantine, and added 189 historical cases – mainly crew members of the Ruby Princess cruise ship – to its tally for the purpose of the World Health Organization’s accounting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

Photograph: Saul Loeb-PoolGetty ImagesThe remarkable global effort to produce a range of Covid-19 vaccines in parallel with developing new treatments – many of which are adapting proven medications for other diseases – is gathering pace.The scale of scientific endeavour is unprecedented, not just in terms of finding a new vaccine, but in the level of co-operation between scientists in quickly sharing results, data and critical genetic details indications of variations in the form of what is known as SARS-CoV-2. Then there is verification of the work of others, enabling promising work to push on.That is the reassuring bit. It heightens the chances of success on both vaccine and antiviral fronts. A rough assessment of timings on potential vaccines would suggest early optimism needs to be tempered and early 2021 is the most likely time one will become available - and only then to some countries.Should we plan for a vaccine in 2021?The realists among the ranks of virologists, immunologists and vaccine developers, who are familiar with all too frequent experience of failure, would say all this is very much on the optimistic side.Trinity College Dublin immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill always refers to a horse racing metaphor you may be leading the Grand National and have just one fence to clear, and fall at the last hurdle.The world also has to face up to the fact that there may never be an effective vaccine. But he is quick to add that the ability to contain the novel virus through a combination of therapies is very likely – as was the case with Aids. Likewise, there are already treatments emerging that will act as a bridge to getting a vaccine in place.The one discordant note undermining this tremendous team play is wealthy countries buying up treatments, as seen with the US recently purchasing all the next three months’ projected production of the drug remdesivir from US manufacturer Gilead – it cuts recovery times, though it is not yet clear if the drug improves survival rates.There remains the risk that more wealthy countries aligned to powerful pharma companies will do the same when a vaccine emerges, and national interests will dominate over the need to give it to those requiring it most.That being said, and acknowledging the case for doing things differently, there are other strategies being born out of desperation – in the form of 10 million cases and 500,000 fatalities and no indication of peak – that are likely to counter that threat.What is the emerging picture on leading vaccine candidates?There are more than 145 candidate vaccines in development, with 17 in human trials. Some have been shown to generate a strong immune response in animals.Those conducting vaccine trials are “chasing the disease around the world”, notably in Brazil and the US. Places where there are high levels of Covid-19 are the best to test efficacy and safety.The extent of that research is likely to mean a range of vaccines of differing type and effectiveness will emerge – the first to come on stream might not be the magic bullet hoped for. But, given the whole world will need protection, a variety of vaccines from different sources is not such a bad thing.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has indicated, for example, its vaccine appeared so promising in preclinical studies they were able to push up the start for testing in healthy volunteers to later this month.The vaccine uses a common-cold virus to deliver a coronavirus antigen into cells to stimulate the immune system to fight off an infection. This type of “vector” using weakened virus is already proven effective and safe in 65,000 humans.Its chief scientific officer Dr Paul Stoffels outlined to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this week how the clinical trial process is being accelerated in the case of Covid-19 with elements run in parallel, while drug companies are already scaling up manufacture of the vaccine to have it ready in the quickest possible time - much different to traditional approaches of the past.If one element fails, all others are then stopped, he confirmed. The vaccine is already in production in the US and Europe with a view to 1 billion doses being available early next year.Meanwhile, the US government is spending billions of dollars in supporting the five best candidates in the hope of having the best one available in the shortest possible time.Other vaccines continue to make significant progress towards clearing each stage of a robust trials processOxford University is regarded as making most progress, and “offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter”, MPs have been told.It is being tested in Brazil and South Africa, where the case numbers are high. Astra Zeneca, the company partnering with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US. European countries are lining up behind this project.BioNTech’s vaccine, being developed with Pfizer in Germany, has confirmed positive trial results, generating immune defences in participants that were stronger than those of the average recovered Covid-19 patient. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is faster than traditional methods.Moderna’s mRNA vaccine trial in the US showed participants developed similar levels of immunity to recovered coronavirus patients, with only minor side effects. Rather than using pathogens to induce an immune response, mRNA vaccines use genetic material that carries instructions for cells to produce proteins that fight disease. However, no marketable mRNA vaccine has been produced to date.China is using a vaccine developed with CanSino Biologics on army personnel though little is known about the type of vaccine involved and extent of deployment.All these factors confirm great progress but there is no clarity on timelines, which underlines the importance of having treatments in the meantime. Uncertainty over the extent to which having the disease confers immunity and protection against re-infection is an added complication pointing to the acute need for Covid medicationstherapies.So what are the promising treatments?Fortunately, the process of finding new treatments is quicker with lower regulatory hurdles to clear, though it has to be said a widely available medication approved for routine use has not materialised yet.Numerous trials are in progress with prompt endorsement of effectiveness or rejection. There has been too much haste on occasion, as in the case of hydroxychloroquine, though some trials are continuing to use this anti-malaria drug and some recent results are more positive.Early indications on dexamethasone – a cheap steroid – suggest it reduced deaths by one-third in patients on a ventilator. A run on dexamethasone ensued as physicians quickly made it part of their standard of care for the sickest patients. This drug, however, looks to be only effective in patients already in a critical state.Remdesivir reduces the duration of infection in hospitalised patients but not mortality. It does not come cheap, costing $2,340 (€2,080) per treatment in the US.Other drugs such as daclatasvir, used to treat Hepatitis C imatinib to treat leukaemia and favipiravir to treat influenza are showing promise. “Cocktails” of these drugs could be deployed as they are no longer patented, meaning they would be easily and cheaply made available.A long-established therapy using “convalescent plasma”, in this instance made from antibodies from people who have had Covid-19, continues to show promise, and it can be manufactured in a laboratory.Likewise, T cells may be sufficient to control infection in the absence of antibodies. T cell responses have been detected in most Covid-19 patients, and first-in-human vaccine trials have reported potent T cell activation. It is possible that T cells’ memory of Sars-CoV-2 may last longer than antibodies.There is also significant work being done on monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies and can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat patients.When it comes to vaccines, was there adequate preparedness for a pandemic?For scientists and doctors who have had to wrestle with the rapid spread of Covid-19 across the world, it is a game of constant catch-up. The insidious nature of the novel virus compounds their difficulties. The picture is incomplete. That said, on a daily basis revealing details emerge so the medical response is being constantly perfected.The bottom line as of now, however, is a safe and effective vaccine remains the best way to achieve herd immunity on a global scale. The lessons for future preparedness are clear.Immunologist Sir John Bell of Oxford University has criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines. It is, however, a global problem that will have to be addressed through sustained funding over many years.This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he told a House of Commons committee.That warning was echoed by Dr Stoffels who outlined the need to have a range of vaccines in place, especially in relation to coronaviruses like Covid-19 and flu, before outbreaks lead to a difficult-to-control pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mammal used to deep water of Atlantic became stranded off east coast on SaturdayUN agency ends treatment after results show little or no reduction in mortalityCreating \u0026lsquogreen list\u0026rsquo of countries safe to go to is unrealistic, says Prof Sam McConkeyTwo men were injured and several residences were significantly damaged in incidentMinister of Agriculture served three-month ban in 2016 after being stopped for drink-drivingMet \u0026Eacuteireann advisory comes into effect from 9pm on Saturday and extends to 8pm on SundayMajority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20thDiageo confirms it will host Guinness Cork Jazz Festival in 2021Publication of \u0026lsquogreen list\u0026rsquo of safe countries postponed amid fears of virus resurgenceCSO looking at options for 2026 census, marking 100 years since State\u0026rsquos first censusQueues have shortened at Ikea since reopening and Dundrum centre footfall is on the riseLawyer tells Helen McEntee State has obligation to look at issue \u0026lsquoas a matter of urgency\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute to ramp up pub inspections following public concerns over lack of social distancingFans were able to listen with their left windows down, sunroof open or through the car radio3.4kg of cannabis resin which had been on its way to Dublin, Kildare, Cork and WaterfordStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296583.1593885839!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cocooning dublin residents celebrate independence on fourth of july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Tina Ward, Tanya Maher and Maura Cudden, enjoy the celebrations at Wolfe Tone Close, Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJuly 4th is a celebration of independence for millions of people in the US. This year, the residents of the Wolfe Tone Close complex in Dublin 1 also celebrated freedom, but the independence they celebrated was their own.The residents of the north-inner city complex, most of whom are over 70, congregated in the community area with their families for a summer barbecue to toast to the easing of coronavirus restrictions and no longer having to cocoon.They had pink and blue balloons hung up – similar to what you would see at a baby shower – to celebrate their “rebirth”, while a DJ played music and everyone drank and ate burgers.Maura Cudden (81) sat at a table with her dog Angel, sipping a glass of red wine. What was she most looking forward to now that she was allowed to mingle with other people? “Getting drunk, of course,” she said with a cheeky laugh, before adding: “I’m only messing, I’m only messing.”Cudden has lived in her apartment for the past 20 years, but she said having to cocoon had created a community among the residents, who used to only say hello in passing.“There were phone numbers being put in my letterbox for if I need anything, there was food left on my table, there would be knocks on the door asking if I needed anything because they were going to the shop,” Cudden said. “It was like I adopted a whole new family. It took the edge off cocooning.”It was not just the community spirit that made the distressing period easier. Her dog did, too.“I used to take her up when the news was on, I used to listen to it because I wanted to know what was going on. When I’d heard the deaths were very high in the beginning, I used to squeeze her to death because I had nobody else to touch or hold so I used to just squeeze her. She gave me such relief,” she added.Imelda Dodrill, who proudly declared that she was the oldest resident in the complex, said she found staying still very difficult.“The lockdown was very hard on me. I celebrated my 90th birthday in May and my family had organised a surprise party, but that never materialised. I worked from when I was 14 until 70, and I like to keep busy. I’m not the type to sit around and stay in,” Dodrill said.She was not terribly excited about restaurants or bars reopening because she is “well past that now”. However, being able to bring her dog Charlie out for walks again was the best part of society reopening.“I brought him out straight away, so I did. I love walking. I walk everywhere, I walk for miles. This, now, being able to move again, is marvellous. It’s like another life.”Margaret Murphy (79) said listening to Joe Dolan was the only way she was able to get through the lockdown, and she was glad she could “get back to normal”.“They told me not to go out so I did what I was told. My daughter lives in west Cork, the other one lives in Carlow and another in Galway. I missed the grandkids,” she said.Now that she no longer has to stay cooped up in her apartment, she has a long list of things she wants to do.“I think I might go on a cruise and travel the world. Well, if I can get the money for that,” she added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296557.1593879919!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus claims one more life while 11 new cases reported in republic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Passengers at Dublin Airport prepare for their trips.

This brings to 1,741 the total number of deaths related to the disease in the Republic.Nphet also reported a further 11 new cases of the disease, bringing the total number of confirmed cases here to 25,509.Meanwhile, a leading professor in infectious diseases has said Ireland should get its “own epidemic under control” before it looks at air bridges and foreign travel. Current Government advice is that all non-essential foreign travel should be avoided, and it will be discussed early next week how travel could resume safely by looking at whether overseas countries could be put on a “green list” if they have low levels of infection.In recent days, health officials have said they are “very concerned” by overseas travel, with foreign travel accounting for about 17 per cent of new cases, compared with about 2 per cent of cases in previous weeks.Sam McConkey, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said adding a “green list” of countries was an “unrealistic, hypothetical suggestion” because many countries that have eliminated the virus will not let Irish people enter due to the prevalence of the virus in the State.“What does an outbreak look like when it’s over? What is the definition of an epidemic being over in a country? That’s really no cases for twice the maximum incubation period, we know it’s 14 days incubation period maximum, so 28 days with no cases in our country and then we all take a big sigh of relief and then any other country that has reached that we would say we could safely fly back and forth.”The green list had been expected to be published next week but sources told The  this would be postponed until July 20th.The British government on Friday published a list of 59 countries to which people can travel without facing quarantine when they return to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not agreed to lift the quarantine rules.Prof McConkey used the example of New Zealand which has “controlled this virus”, but will not allow tourists from Ireland to enter the country due to the presence of Covid-19 in the State.He added that giving clarity on what would happen in three weeks’ time was “not realistic” because of how volatile the virus was.Prof McConkey advocated for the idea of a “staycation” this summer for members of the Irish public.“The Department of Foreign Affairs advice is very, very clear and it says no non-essential travel outside the island of Ireland. Heather Humphreys brought this idea of a staycation. I’m booked for west Cork and I think that’s what most of us should be doing,” he added.Speaking on the same programme, Fine Gael TD and Minister of State for Retail Businesses Damien English said the Government was due to meet on Monday to discuss overseas travel.“Around travel and restrictions and quarantine, that’s going to the full Cabinet on Monday. Every effort is being made here for two issues. One is the public health and to give confidence to people from this country and travelling into this country. The aim is at some stage, be it Monday or at a later stage, to have a list of countries that are safe to travel to and from,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296523.1593854183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"only a civil servant could have come up with unenforceable pub regulations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClancy’s Bar, Cork City has introduced temperature checks, private snugs and a roof garden. Pictured, Zaida Reyes  cleaning glass in one of the snugs. Photograph: Clare KeoghA publican in Cork has said he is not re-opening under Covid-19 restrictions because they would turn his bar “into a crime scene” and believes he would alienate customers. Con Dennehy, who owns the Venue in Ballintemple, is one of the 60 per cent of Cork publicans who opted not to re-open until July 20th, saying that he didn’t believe the current regulations where customers must book a slot and have a meal were particularly practical.“No, I haven’t reopened -I didn’t want to turn the bar into a crime scene with tape and screens everywhere and I didn’t want to alienate people I know and respect by telling them that they have to leave after 90 minutes or 105 minutes,” he told The . “To my mind, it’s only civil servants who could have made up these regulations because they are totally impractical and totally unenforceable - I’d rather stay closed until September if needs be to open properly for my locals and not end up alienating them with these regulations.”Mr Dennehy said that he expects to open on July 20th and when he does, he trusts his customers to be responsible regarding social distance and keeping one metre apart of their own volition, rather than he or his staff having to go around and asking people to keep apart.“Who is going to police social distancing? The gardaí hardly want to get involved in it, that’s a HSE job and do they have the personnel to police it? I think people should look after their own interest and do the sensible thing and keep their distance without having to be told.“If any fellow is iffy about going into a pub, he shouldn’t go in - I saw fellows coming in March before we closed down and they were taking their pint off the counter and stepping back and they were keeping their own social distance, they didn’t have to be asked so it was working back then.”‘Very co-operative’The majority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20th but those that have re-opened and are serving food in line with Government guidelines are generally expressing satisfaction with business, according to the Chair of the Cork Vintners Federation of Ireland, Michael O’Donovan.Mr O’Donovan said that approximately 40 per cent of the 208 pubs in the city and suburbs re-opened last Monday, serving substantial meals to customers who have to make a booking at the pub and generally it seemed to be working out reasonably well.“A few bars had some teething problems with people coming in and asking for a drink and the bar staff or management having to explain to them that they are really operating as a restaurant and they have to have food and they then can have a drink to accompany it.”Mr O’Donovan said the majority of customers have been very co-operative even though some of the bars are finding the 105-minute limit too restrictive, particularly when they are serving customers a three course meal which is being made to order in the pub.He said there did not appear to be any major problem with people turning up without bookings even though inidual pubs operated different systems with some pubs having set times that people can book while others are allowing the customers to choose a time and then booking a slot at that time.“All the bars have people at the door particularly in the evening so when people come to the door if they have capacity, they take them but if they are full they are moving on - what is noticeable that people are having multiple bookings, some in the same venue or some in other venues.”He said that all bars are operating social distancing and most people are being very co-operative even though he has heard of one or two cases where people have tried to pull tables together but once management explained that this wasn’t allowed, they accepted it.Mr O’Donovan, who runs the Castle Inn on South Main Street in the heart of Cork city, said that he would be waiting until July 20th as he does not serve food in the bar and like many of the 60pc of bars who have opted to wait until July 20th, he does not have a booking service.“We will have capacity for 28 people with one metre social distancing when we re-open on July 20th but if the Government introduce a booking system on July 20th, a lot of bars will remain close because they don’t have a booking engine.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296549.1593872336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach disappointed he only learned of barry cowen s driving ban on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen said he was ‘profoundly sorry’ about the incident.

The law on drink-driving for learner drivers four years ago meant a concentration 10mg-35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath was considered over the limit.Mr Cowen’s case did not go to court as the level of alcohol in his system was on the lower scale and did not reach the level required for prosecution.Mr Cowen said he was “profoundly sorry” about the incident, adding that it was “an appalling lapse and one which I have to accept and learn from”.In a statement on Saturday morning, the Taoiseach said he was first made aware of the “issue” on Friday afternoon.“I have spoken to Minister Cowen and I accept that his remorse about this incident is genuine,” he said. “I am disappointed that I learned about it in this way and have made that clear to him.”Mr Cowen was appointed Minister for Agriculture last week by the Taoiseach and was a member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team in the coalition talks.The Minister has been a TD since 2011 and served as the party’s public expenditure spokesman for the past two years.He comes from a long line of Fianna Fáil politicians, with his brother Brian a former taoiseach and their late father Ber a former TD."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre.

The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"More than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israel\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"local lockdown qa put questions daniel capurro paul nuki","story":"As Leicester became the first city to be placed under a local lockdown on Monday, many have been left wondering whether other areas of the UK could also be heading towards renewed lockdown restrictions.Government sources have told The  that the northern towns of Barnsley, Oldham and Rochdale and the city of Bradford, along with Bedford, are all at risk of being placed under a local lockdown to help reduce rising infection rates. But how does the Government identify which regions could be placed under a local lockdown?

Can I see some BBC researchers waving at the back of the room? Welcome to the world as some of us have known it for a long time.There is nothing at all surprising here: this is just what happens to pretty much any protest that grabs the public imagination. All it takes is a flurry of headlines and a few choice spots on the broadcast news and your cause is a prime candidate for infiltration by the people who attach the same label to everything that attracts socially acceptable opprobrium: all forms of injustice, suffering or potential damage can be attributed to the original sin of capitalism (or imperialism which is just an export version of the profit motive).This process of infiltration has been the deliberate policy of Leftwing militancy since my grandmother’s day. She was a Communist party member in the 1930s. As a sewing machine operator in the Jewish rag trade during the American Depression, she became a trade unionist and then a party activist. When my father was a boy, he was sent along to meetings of book clubs and community organisations with innocent-sounding apolitical names which were actually front groups designed to educate the young in the proper doctrine.He stopped attending, he once told me, when he realised that it was the same handful of people running all these various activities - and that the arguments they were pitching were pretty much identical in every context. Most of these organisations had, almost certainly, once been what their names still proclaimed them to be - promoters of local interests or pastimes - before they were hollowed out and turned into propaganda organs for what was then the Stalinst Soviet regime.By the time I reached my own youthful stage of political activism, the practice was called “entryism” and it was Trotsky who was the hero, not Stalin. But the principle was the same: not only were we advised to join and influence the direction of any influential new movement that appeared on the scene but even, if we were really up for lifelong dedication, to make a permanent professional commitment to the process.In New Left circles in the late 1960s and early 70s, it was commonplace for members of International Socialism (IS) which was the earlier incarnation of the Socialist Workers’ Party, to resign their membership in order to join Labour – because in those days, before James Callaghan changed the rules on entryism, you could not be a member of both at the same time. They would then run for the local council and exert as much control as possible over their borough’s political stance. (You may recall the Vietcong flags that occasionally flew over Labour town halls.)Other IS members we knew took on jobs as trade union officials, some of whom I believe remain in post. But most committed activists just stayed in whatever employment they could find that was reasonably congenial (there were lots of them in the print trades and in academic life) and gave over their spare time to the radical cause in any number of guises. So when I heard that Joshua Virasami, a leader and vociferous spokesman of the UK BLM movement, had declared that capitalism was terrorism, and that the police who represented state terrorism, should be defunded – and further, that he had previously chained himself to fellow activists outside a London airport on the grounds that global climate change was racist, I thought, ah yes... here we are again.Then came the scramble of various organisations that should have been less naive (or might at least have spent ten minutes doing some intensive Googling) to disassociate themselves from the more absurd demands being put forward in the name of BLM. The BBC – obviously – was most prominent, advising its presenters to est themselves of BLM badges on air. Then there were various Premier League football teams and some sports commentators from Sky television... well you know the rest.The whole phenomenon managed in the end to be both ludicrous and sad. It had begun with a genuinely tragic event which was eminently worthy of protest: the killing of an unarmed black man by a white policeman while fellow officers stood by and watched, even though it took place in another country, was so horrifying that public demonstrations of outrage seemed perfectly understandable. There was nothing unreasonable about George Floyd’s death being used as a symbol of bigotry and racial injustice throughout the world.It all went horribly wrong when the agitators moved in and started shooting their mouths off. But stupidity and incoherence and opportunism are always with us. The truly culpable players in this game are the tag-along media and celebrity hangers-on who are so guileless that they facilitate the corrupting of a legitimate protest movement by political manipulation. So what is this all about in the minds of those amateur – or professional – infiltrators?Surely they are not consciously malign: simply subverting good causes for the sheer hell of it? No reader, this is not just nihilism or puerile mischief. If you have bought the Marxist package (or the faux Marxist one that now seems to be the only version available) you actually, sincerely believe that capitalism – the profit motive – is the cause of every social tragedy.Instead of seeing free market economics as a great liberator – having delivered mass prosperity, and the self-determination which follows from it, on a scale that is unprecedented in human history – you regard it as the enslavement of one class (or race) by another. And if you honestly believe that, then you see it as your moral duty to make use of every vehicle available for telling this story to the benighted mob who have been tricked into a state of false consciousness by their exploiters. This is the great lie that made possible one of the most successful tyrannies in modern history. It still needs to be challenged and deconstructed over and over again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure duke speak fbi without home office intervening","story":"Home Secretary Priti Patel is facing a diplomatic quandary after US prosecutors submitted a formal request for the Duke of York to speak to them about claims Maxwell trafficked young women for sex for Jeffrey Epstein.Their request was made through the filing of a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) to the Home Office, as part of an agreement allowing the US to seek help from the British authorities in a legal or criminal matter.But it is now understood the British Government is in favour of the stand-off between the Duke and the FBI being sorted out between the two parties, rather than by any ministerial intervention under a MLA.The Duke had a long friendship with Epstein and stayed at his homes, including Epstein’s mansion in New York and his home in the US Virgin Islands.Prosecutors believe he could have vital information as a witness rather than a suspect, although the Duke insists he never saw or suspected any wrongdoing in the times he stayed at Epstein’s homes.As a potential witness the Duke cannot be compelled to talk to the FBI, but the matter threatens to become deeply embarrassing for the Home Office following the submission of the MLA.Extradition expert Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC, head of Drystone Chambers, said: “I’m sure the Home Office would rather the two parties deal with it themselves without any ministerial involvement. The last thing they want is to find themselves caught between the Royal family on one side and the US authorities on the other. They do not want to navigate through that.”Ms Maxwell is accused of lying about Epstein’s sexual activities, including the recruitment of underage girls for sexual massages. The perjury allegations are the only charges brought against Ms Maxwell to date that relate to a period of time when the Duke knew Epstein.The more serious offences of child sex trafficking and grooming are alleged to have taken place between 1994 and 1997, two years before the Duke was introduced to Epstein.The alleged offences against one of the victims took place in London between 1994 and 1995, when she was under the age of 18.Campaign groups and lawyers representing victims of sex abuse have now called on the politan Police to mount their own investigation into the London allegations rather than just defer to US investigators.Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor and founder and director of  the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “If there are offences that took place in London and the politan Police’s area then they should investigate them, if that is what the victims want.”Scotland Yard said it had liaised with other law enforcement organisations but had not received a formal request asking for assistance in connection with the allegations.US prosecutors said they would “welcome” the Duke’s testimony as part of the ongoing FBI investigation, with Audrey Strauss, acting US Attorney for the Southern District for New York, urging the Duke to come forward to be questioned.The Duke’s lawyers say they twice contacted the US Department of Justice in the past month but received no response. A source close to the Duke’s team said: “We’ve been in contact with the US Department of Justice saying we’re willing to offer assistance. The Duke has indicated his intention to cooperate with the investigation and the ball is now in their court.“There is still a dialogue going on and we are sure the Home Office would not want to intervene.”The Duke’s legal problems deepened on Friday after a new lawsuit from one of Epstein’s alleged victims was filed on Thursday.The civil claim against Epstein’s $630 million (£505 million) estate is being brought by Caroline Kaufman, now 26, who alleges that she was sexually abused by Epstein in 2010 when she was 17 at the financier’s New York mansion. She claims that she was raped while the Duke of York was visiting. The Duke claimed he had travelled to the US to cut ties with Epstein, who committed suicide last year in a new York cell while facing fresh charges.The lawsuit does not accuse the Duke of wrongdoing or of being aware of the alleged attack. He has previously said of Epstein, who died in prison last year: “At no stage during the limited time I spent with (Epstein) did I see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.”Geoffrey Berman, who was controversially fired as US attorney for the Southern District of New York last month by the Trump administration, will appear at a congressional committee to answer questions. Mr Berman led the Maxwell investigation and publicly called for the Duke of York to speak to him a number of times, including claiming that the royal had been resisting the move. Mr Berman is due to spend hours giving testimony to the House Judiciary Committee next Thursday. Congressmen could seek to better understand why prosecutors are so keen to talk to the Duke and the full details of his legal team’s correspondence about giving an interview. A spokesman for the prosecutors at the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the question of Mutual Legal Assistance. The Home Office would not confirm or deny the existence of an MLA request.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"super saturday pictures lockdown ends pubs reopen","story":"Thrillseekers were out early today as \u0027Super Saturday\u0027 began and England\u0027s lockdown restrictions eased.

Our Taiwan-Hong Kong Office for Exchanges \u0026amp Services is dedicated to helping #HKers transition to a new life here in Taiwan,” tweeted Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese president, on Friday. The announcement came on the same day that China’s top legislative body started drafting the controversial legislation, in an apparent rush to push through a law that bans subversion, separatism and acts of foreign interference, but which critics say will be used to crush dissent. Britain, which has accused China of violating a legally-binding joint declaration that guaranteed the city’s way of life until 2047, this week persuaded all G7 industrialised nations to sign a statement expressing deep concern about Beijing’s plans.The UK has also stepped up to offer up to 3 million Hong Kong holders of a “British National Overseas” passport a pathway to citizenship if the law goes ahead. In Hong Kong people are already making plans to take up offers of refuge. “I fear that Hong Kong is no longer a safe place to live anymore,” said a 23-year-old male clerk working at a political organisation, who wished to remain anonymous.  He said he was already processing the paperwork for his BNO passport.“My local passport doesn\u0027t safeguard my identity anymore,” he said, adding that he feared his political work would make him a target under the new law, possibly leading to his imprisonment. “The future of Hong Kong is definitely in despair. No matter which side you are with, either you’re fervently pro-democracy or loyal to the Communist Party, society remains deeply polarised. The ending for Hong Kong will be full of darkness,” he said. Ms Li, an airline worker in her forties, told The  that she was fearful enough about the law to urgently consider uprooting her entire life. “(The law) is another form of cultural revolution,” she said, adding that she and her fiancé would emigrate as soon as borders started to reopen after the pandemic. “I’m sorry to the youngsters. I don’t have their strength and guts to fight for Hong Kong. I’m truly sorry,” she said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises.“No pubs have been closed by the police.“We’d like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.”Elsewhere, police in Essex claim to have made four arrests following a “disturbance” in Brentwood High Street.Special inspector Steve Weaver tweeted: “That didn’t last long. Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion.

You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyMore than a quarter of children in Leicester (27 per cent) live in poverty before housing costs are taken into account.Save the Children has warned that without urgent intervention, the high level of child poverty could rise, pushing families even further below the breadline.Recent research by the charity, alongside the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that families on universal credit and child tax credit are struggling to afford food and basic utilities, such as gas and electricity, with two thirds sliding into debt since the start of lockdown. With the lockdown measures extended in Leicester, families on low incomes will be forced to struggle for even longer.

We need urgent action to support struggling families – a £20 a week increase will give families with children the lifeline they need to pull them through these difficult times.“By taking action now, we can prevent increased child poverty from becoming a damaging legacy of this pandemic, which has already caused too much suffering.”Other cities and towns said to be at risk of local lockdowns include Bradford, Barnsley, Rochdale and Oldham, all of which have some of the highest rates of deprivation in England. More than 100,000 children in these areas are already living in poverty and could be at even greater risk if lockdowns are extended, Save the Children added.Research by Loughborough University, published earlier in the year, showed that child poverty in the UK has increased by 2.8 per cent in the last four years. Experts involved in the study warned that this figure will grow for the entire country as a result of the pandemic.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Ten in the morning on the first day of pubs reopening since lockdown and in Sheffield’s most central Wetherspoon pub Connor Bowling and his two mates are already three pints deep, Full English full and considering ordering a round of Jagermeisters.“It’s early, but why not?” the 23-year-old gas engineer says. “It’s been a long three months.”Thus began the much-anticipated day on which, to paraphrase the prime minister, English people regained their ancient unalienable right to go out and drink. Fourth July: when the country’s pubs and bars reopened for the first time following 15 weeks and one day of coronavirus lockdown when the government told us: get to the boozer – the economy needs you.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat had Bowling and his pals got planned in order to do their duty? “No plans,” he said, sat in The Sheffield Water Works Company. “Other than it getting messy.”Twelve hours later, with the night now in full swing, it seemed that, while plenty had similar aspirations, the weekend would not, in fact, be the booze-apocalypse many had feared.Sheffield was Saturday night busy – but only just. Roughly half of all pubs were shut – a figure in line with national reports – and few of those open had queues outside, despite social distancing rules meaning they were only able to cater for about 70 per cent normal capacity. Certainly, the lines did not compare to those which formed outside reopened barbers and hair salons in the morning and afternoon.Three pints deep at 10am as pub drinkers toast end to lockdown“I wonder what that says about people?” pondered 19-year-old Ria Hinchliffe in The Wick At Both Ends pub. “I’m having mine done on Tuesday.”A\u0026ampE figures and arrest numbers will come in due course. But on the streets and in the bars of this South Yorkshire city, this did not feel like the mass release of energy many had predicted. If social distancing wasn’t exactly being observed everywhere, nor perhaps was it being smashed to quite the extent one might expect following a 106 day shut down. Similar scenes were experienced in towns and cities across England, including Manchester and Newcastle, reports suggested.“People have been behaving really well, actually,” said Amy Locke, a bar manager at the city’s Forum bar. “Once you’re at a table, you’re not supposed to get up and mix with other people and we’ve had to ask a few people to stop doing that. I’ve felt a bit like a school teacher telling people to sit down but I think people understand why.”Among the changes from a pre-Covid world were hand-sanitiser on doors, Perspex screens on counters, more table service and music turned right down. Among the similarities were the odd lad still having an indiscrete wee in the odd doorway.“It’s actually quite civilised, isn’t it?” said Idony Lee – talking about the table service not the doorway misuse. “It reminds me of how people drink on the continent.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’d rather know I’d enjoyed myself than stayed sat at home afraid of a virus.”She may have been 52 years younger but 19-year-old project coordinator Chloe Pownall, drinking in The Wick At Both Ends, felt something similar.“What are we going to do?” she asked. “Just stay in forever? Especially because I’m quite young, so I just think it’s worth the risk.”She was on a pint of Carling. How did it taste from the tap? “So, so good,” she said. “People look down at you for being a girl drinking pints. Couldn’t care less.”In London, earlier in the day, there had been a similar situation.John, a 66-year-old who lives in Putney and was enjoying a pint with a newspaper in the JJ Moon pub in Tooting Broadway, said: “This tastes a lot better out of a glass than it does out of a tin, that I can tell you.”While he said that the return to pubs pales in comparison with seeing his grandchildren after three months of shielding, he agreed that the renewed sense of community would offer a boost after the hardships of lockdown.“At the moment, where this pub’s concerned, it seems to be working out fine, but you can’t judge one pub by all pubs,” he said. “The way it is in here now, it’s quite modern. It’s not too hectic either. I’m quite happy with it.”Of whether pre-booking systems could affect the spontaneity of going for a drink, he added: “Possibly, it all depends how busy it is. Saturday night, a lot of people, in the event of a football match where it’s screened in certain pubs, that could take its toll. You’ll probably have a line-up about half a mile down the road waiting to get in to see the match.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Pubs in south London have reopened with more of an initial whimper than a bang, as the thirstiest punters were given a taste of the post-coronavirus reality facing one of the nation’s favourite habitats.Despite pubs being granted permission to start serving at 6am, there appeared little sign of the New Year’s Eve-esque “Super Saturday” hype forecast by many, with some establishments remaining shuttered after midday and others, on the face of it, appearing relatively empty.In Tooting, the queues outside hairdressers by far outstripped those outside favoured locals – an outcome that had been hinted at by Redfield \u0026amp Wilton polling for the BBC, which indicated just seven per cent of adults in England intended to visit a pub this weekend.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several people spoken to by The Independent questioned whether the calm and ordered atmosphere would hold come Saturday night, the clear contrast with a trip to the pub before they were forced to close more than 100 days ago was stark.Customers were greeted at doorways with hand sanitisers and test and trace forms, in many cases asked if they had a booking and how many people would be sitting at their table – which could seat a maximum of six people.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“It’s like a restaurant,” one Wetherspoons customer remarked, although the reality was often not far from checking into a hotel, with drinkers given a short tour of the premises, told how to order drinks, which directions to walk, where to stand and queue at the bar, and where to leave their contact-tracing forms on their way out.With customers forbidden from propping up the bar in most establishments, Wetherspoons customers are asked to stand in a small box at the bar demarcated by black and yellow tape on the floor. Asked how she is feeling about the reopening, a bartender replied from behind perspex glass that she is “stressed” – a feeling unlikely to be due to high levels of custom, given JJ Moon’s typical capacity of 290 people has been reduced to 79 to allow for social distancing, and more likely due to the challenges in navigating and enforcing the new rules.John, a 66-year-old who lives in Putney and was enjoying a pint with a newspaper in the Tooting Broadway pub, said: “This tastes a lot better out of a glass than it does out of a tin, that I can tell you.”While he said that the return to pubs pales in comparison with seeing his grandchildren after three months of shielding, he agreed that the renewed sense of community would offer a boost after the hardships of lockdown.

Saturday night, a lot of people, in the event of a football match where it’s screened in certain pubs, that could take its toll.“You’ll probably have a line-up about half a mile down the road waiting to get in to see the match.”While JJ Moons, the only pub in Tooting with a short queue outside, appeared to be at capacity, a focus on table service saw groups and iniduals more or less marooned at their tables, leaving plenty of rare open space typically filled with bodies and precariously held pints.In the relatively quiet atmosphere, one elderly local joked with an acquaintance several tables away that he’d been thinking about stopping drinking, adding: “But when you get that first pint, that’s it, isn’t it? It’s nice to be able to come out and talk, that’s the difference – socialising.”Whitty warns opening pubs are a \u0027high risk\u0027 for spreading coronavirusSeveral hundred yards away in The Antelope – a popular local – customers are asked if they have a booking, and are greeted with a form titled “The Antelope’s New Normal”.“Like Boris, we are relying on the cooperation and common sense of you all so please remember that when pubs aren’t exactly how you remember them, or hoped they would be, we’ve all been in lockdown too,” it reads. “Things will get back to normal, just not straight away. Please be patient with us.”By 2pm, the indoor seating areas and beer garden were already well-populated, with table service rendering it unnecessary for customers to order at the bar.Emma, a 25-year-old from Margate, and Taylor, a 24-year-old from Cambridgeshire both told The Independent it was “fantastic” to be back in a pub, but said they were visiting London with the intention of looking for a flat to rent post-lockdown, rather than going drinking.“It’s weird but it feels normal at the same time,” Emma said. “Walking in with all the segregated walkways, that was odd, but being outside it feels just normal still ... I just want a pint – drinking beer from the bottle is not the same.”Taylor said: “I wouldn’t feel comfortable meeting a big group of people in a pub at the moment, unless it was in a big outside area”, while Emma added: “I think now it’s fine but later it’s going to get stressful. I can imagine it getting pretty out of hand.”If social distancing in pubs works, it may also end sexual harassmentThree pints deep at 10am as pub drinkers toast end to lockdownStop judging people at the pub – it\u0027s not just about getting drunkAsked whether they expect people to maintain social distancing later, they reply “absolutely not” and “definitely not”.While the stringent new rules make it seem likely that social distancing may largely be maintained within establishments, policing the streets outside may prove more difficult – particularly given the difficulties of getting into already busy pubs and bars without a booking, and the relatively short stays allowed.Taylor added: “In London, walking down the street, it’s so busy. So if you put that with alcohol, it’s not going to end well.”Speaking in light of the crowds seen in Clapham, Streatham and Tooting Bec Commons in recent weeks (a 26-year-old friend texts at around 1pm reporting Clapham is already “rammed”), she added: “If you think at how stressful the parks have been, imagine that in a pub. It’s going to be horrible.”The government itself appears to have tempered its vocal desire for the nation to drink to the economy’s good health on Saturday, with the prime minister contradicting Jacob Rees-Mogg’s “yard of ale” comments and HM Treasury deleting a celebratory “pubs are back” tweet, telling the public to “grab a drink and raise a glass”.While it is far from clear what lasting effect the virus will have upon England’s pub culture, the effects of lockdown upon iniduals’ drinking habits are also cause for concern in some quarters.Research published on Friday by Alcohol Change UK found that 28 per cent of those surveyed who have ever drunk alcohol think they have been drinking more during lockdown. As pubs reopen and lockdown eases, two thirds polled said they expect to continue drinking as they have been during lockdown, or even drink more.Emma said that while she had spent lockdown with her family, who do not drink much, she believes many of her friends who live in London are going to the park “regularly” and drinking more “just because it’s something to do”.But asked whether she would return to the pub as often as before the pandemic, Emma replied: “No. I think where you can sit in a park and drink, I would definitely choose that over going to the pub still.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Prime Minister announced yesterday the reopening of most of the hospitality sector from July , but the days of dragging friends onto the dance floor and yelling to be heard of loud music are over for a while. The guidance tells pub owners to take steps to prevent other close contact activities, such as communal dancing. It adds: All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid peopleneeding to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music orbroadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed ata volume that makes normal conversation dficult.Temptations including live entertainment, loud music and sports broadcasts will all be banned in British pubs to keep people on their best behaviour. The Government warned businesses to stop people taking part in group singing or chanting as well because it carries an increased risk of spreading coronavirus. Dance floors will also be repurposed into table areas and patrons will need to be sat downthey want to be indoors. Another favourite pastime is also on the chopping block - the pub quiz will have to stay virtual at least for the moment. This is because of concerns it could lead to yelling and spread the virus. But in a hopeful sign for entertainment in pubs when conversation runs dry, the guidance said it will continue to develop based on scientic evidence to enable these activities as soon as possible.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In this one dimension, the British proposal would help to head off some of those losses.”Dr Peter Holmes, reader in economics, said: “What the UK government is seeking from the EU on rules of origin is unprecedented.“To the average Brexit supporter this approach may sound ridiculous and not part of any deal they voted for, but without it Japanese car plants risk facing  per cent tarfs on cars made in the UKthey use engines, gearboxes or other components made in Japan.”Nigel Farage, well known for his fondness for beer, tweeted a picture of himself in a reopened pub, but was met by a storm of tweeted criticism and suggestions he should still be observing a -day quarantine as mandated for people traveling from the United States.Farage attended a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June .Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on police to investigate whether Nigel Farage has broken quarantine rules.Mr Farage tweetED a photo of himself at .pm today from a Kent pub declaring # oclock, first customer in. Love it.# However, he insisted he had been back from a trip to the US for two weeks and had tested negative for Covid-.Sir Ed wrote to chief constable Alan Pughsley, stating: #I write out of concern that one of your local residents may have broken quarantine rules regarding international travel and is putting lives at risk with a wilful disregard for scientic and medical advice.The Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss has said Britain will boom once Brexit is completedit can successfully form partnerships with other countries.She claimed the UK would greatly benefit from becoming a part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacic Partnershiponce Brexit was out of the way.During a speech at a Policy Exchange webinar event, Ms Truss claimed the CPTPP would allow Britain to grow in ways that it could not, had it stayed a member of the EU.Ms Truss said: #I also think it’s important to recognise these benefits we could gain by joining CPTPP that wouldn’t have been able to access as a member of the European Union.#We would be able to accede to this agreement in ways that does not damage our national sovereignty.#There is no ECJ and there is no harmonisation of domestic regulation and there is no seizing of our sovereign power.#Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Kenyas President Uhuru Kenyatta for private talks today during which the two leaders agreed to start negotiations for a Kenya-United Kingdom post-Brexit trade agreement.The negotiations, which are expected to be finalised ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU on st December , will be conducted within the Kenya-UK Strategic Partnership Framework established by the two leaders in January  and the East African Communityparameters in order to enhance regional integration.In a telephone conversation at State House, President Kenyatta and Boris Johnson also discussed several Kenya-UK bilateral interests among them the two nation’s response to the global Covid- health crisis.The UK needs to show more #ambition#it wants to secure a post-Brexit deal with the EU before the end of the transition period, European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said today.the Irish commissioner spoke with Ireland’s RTÉ radio today and said the EU over the past few months has shown it is willing to compromise, but that a #lack of ambition# on the UK side means #very little has happened.#Hogan said: “There’s a frustration on the EU side about the fact that the good faith in terms of the negotiations that’s required on both sides is not happening to the extent that it should.“Boris Johnson has explicitly stated that he wants a deal, so we need to see movement on the U.K. side soon or  it’s going to be too late.The commissioner added that he still believes that a deal can be struck by December , when the transition period ends.“The ambition of that deal on the EU side is real. I don’t see the same ambition on the U.K. side, so the ball is in the U.K.’s court. If they want a deal, there is a deal to be done,” he said.Plans to enshrine a UK #internal market# after Brexit would seriously undermine devolution, the Scottish Governments Constitution Secretary has said.Michael Russell said proposals from the UK Government would be a #power grab# on responsibilities held by the Scottish Parliament.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, he said he is concerned about proposals for an external body which would #test# whether a bill in Holyrood affected the UKs internal market.The letter also details concerns about plans for a #mutual recognition regime#, which he said could lower regulatory standards beyond what the Scottish Parliament found acceptable.Mr Russell said the proposals, which have not been published, #ignore the reality and history of devolution# and would be opposed by the Scottish Government.The EU and the UK issued statements early on Thursday afternoon calling an end to the talks.There was meant to be another day of discussions on Friday # but British officials led by David Frost ed to London.In a statement, Mr Frost said: “We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days. “Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.“The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. #But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.”Talks are due to resume in London next week.Mr Barnier has said that there needs to be a “sustainable and long-term solution” on fisheries.Such a solution must take into account the needs of European fishermen for certainty over their livelihoods.It must also feature an effective all-encompassing dispute settlement mechanism to ensure both sides stick to their obligations.“We will continue to insist on parallel progress on all areas,” he said. “The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. #We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom.”Mr Barnier says the UK has established red lines over its negotiations, including “no role for the European court of justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real dference”.But he suggested the EU’s willingness to be flexible on its initial demands in light of the British positions had not been met with similar understanding from Downing Street over Brussels’ red lines.The latest negotiations in Brussels on an EU-UK trade and security deal have broke up early this week.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has complained of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government.The two sides ended the week’s talks – the first held in person since February – a day ahead of the jointly agreed schedule.Both Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost say theyre facing “serious” disagreements.“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” Barnier said in a statement. “However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain.”Holidays for Brits are going to be more expensive now after the value of the pound dropped during lockdown.In February, £ was worth €. # but its since dropped by ten pence to €..On Tuesday, it was €. to every pound.This means that Brits will get £ less on every £ they exchange into euros this summer.Experts have blamed the fall in the pound against the euro down to the coronavirus outbreak and uncertainty around Brexit negotiations.Image: AlamyBritain is considering joining an EU plan to secure supplies of potential vaccines against Covid-, officials in London and Brussels said on Friday.The UK-EU talks, first reported by the Financial Times, represent a test of the cooperation required to tackle international emergencies after Brexit.The EU is planning to spend around  billion euros on the advance purchase of vaccines in testing, on behalf of the  EU states.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she is trying to convince “a signicant number” of world leaders to join forces and buy vaccines up front together, as competition for a vaccine could otherwise raise the cost for everyone.  Once Britain leaves the Brexit transition period and the European Single Market next January, the Government plans to implement a new IT system to manage the additional border checks that will be needed.The new # and untested # system is known as the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, or GVMS.It means UK companies exporting into the EU will have to wait for permission from the taxman before they can move their goods.According to a document circulated by HMRC, lorries will only be able to move loads into the EUthey have a valid reference from GVMS.Hauliers will need to file the correct customs paperwork electronically in advance in order to get approval # and the Government plans to bar trucks without clearance from reaching ports.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has called on Brits to eat out to help out as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions ease today.He says a generation of young people risk being #lost# unless the public starts spending in pubs and restaurants.He told The Times: #This is a consumption-driven economy people used to, three months ago, go out with their friends or family to go and have a meal.#Mr Sunak said that the public had to “relearn what it’s like to go out again” and added, in what may become his new slogan: “Eat out to help out”. Image: WmediaBritish businesses are increasingly worried that the UK governments planned system to check goods heading to the European Union wont be ready in time for when the Brexit transition period ends in .The Government plans to bring in an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from January .But leading UK business groups have told Business Insider that the government has failed to confirm to them how the system will work and whether it will be fully al in time.One senior figure who is in close contact with the government about its Brexit plans says Government officials #just dont know# how the new arrangements will work.Royal Dutch Shell is not ruling out moving its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, the oil companys chief executive Ben van Beurden said in an interview with a Dutch newspaper.Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.#You always need to keep thinking,# Shells Van Beurden told the newspaper. #Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. #But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.#A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEOs comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simply its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years. The England and Wales Cricket Board has approved an increase in overseas players in domestic cricket from next year and will now allow two per side in four-day and -over cricket.Teams are currently allowed to field only one imported player, though foreign-born players with British passports and those on Kolpak registrations have not counted towards the allocation.The effects of Brexit mean Kolpak deals will be terminated at the end of the postponed  campaign meaning those players # as well as those who have had deals cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic # will now have a greater chance to earning deals.The move was recommended by the performance cricket committee, chaired by Sir Andrew Strauss.An expert says the dferences on fishing could prove to be too dficult to resolve # because Whitehall doesnt have enough expertise in fisheries laws to extricate the UK from European rules.According to iNews, Andrew Oliver said it is unlikely the industry will be free of European control before  and that it “might never happen”.He said that it may eventually be possible to wrestle back some of the quota and fishing rights taken by European fleets # but that it would probably cost billions of pounds in compensation.He said: “I think it will take up to  years before we are completely orced and have our own stand-alone statute book.#One of the big disagreements between the EU and the UK is over fishing.During the referendum campaign in , Brexiteers argued in favour of Britain ditching the Common Fisheries Policy.The agreement opens up UK fishing grounds to European vessels.The calls to get rid of it has left many British fishermen furious.And the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told Boris Johnson and David Frost thatthe UK wants access to European markets, the country must open up its fisheries.The UKs top civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, revealed plans to step down from his role in September earlier this week.In a letter to Boris Johnson he said that he believed it was the right time to leave as the UK moved into the next phase of the governments coronavirus recovery plan.But there was alleged tensions between Sir Mark and Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers most influential aide, and cabinet minister Michael Gove.No sources said Dominic Cummings thought Sir Mark was a barrier to #Whitehall reform,# with the agreement of Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, reports .His departure is part of an overhaul of the civil service spearheaded by Nos top adviser Cummings.Brexit adviser David Frost will step in as national security adviser.News organisation Bloomberg is reporting that the Brexit gang is back in charge in Britain.Writers say Boris Johnson has #little time for conventions#.#Despite being a product of the English establishment # educated at Eton and Oxford # he has surrounded himself with the band of brothers who upended the existing order with their  Brexit campaign and are bent on continuing the revolution in government.#The tight-knit group of trusted aides is determined to reshape the country, bringing investment to depressed areas and overhauling how the government is run. #After three months battling the coronavirus pandemic, which nearly killed Johnson and damaged his reputation for competence, the premier and his team of revolutionaries are now re-asserting their reforming agenda.#Michael Gove says a no-deal Brexit could lead to UK business being #adversely affected#.He made the admission after being questioned by former Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo on Times Radio.Mr Portillo said: #Its possible that well reach the end of the Brexit transition period and leave without signing a deal with the European Union.#I think that before the general election you were very worried about a no-deal Brexit. #What changed #Mr Gove admitted that he was #worried# that the UK would not be #sufficiently prepared# for an exit without a deal.#Id much rather that we secured a free trade agreement with the EU,# he said.The home shopping tycoon who was among the most prominent business backers of Britains departure from the EU has put his company up for sale.Sky News reports that John Mills has instructed Cavendish Corporate Finance to contact prospective buyers of JML, a multichannel retailer of consumer products.It comes just months before the end of the Brexit transition period.The process is at an early stage and is not expected to result in a deal for several months, according to a source.Earlier this week, the deadline passed for the UK and the EU to extend the Brexit transition period.It means theres no going back # and were leaving the EU, with a deal or without one, at the end of the year.Now Boris Johnson has suggested thatthe UK and EU could not reach an agreement with the bloc, then an “Australia-style” arrangement with the bloc would be a “very good option”. Australia does not have a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. While specic agreements are in place for certain goods, much EU-Australia trade takes place on World Trade Organisation terms. French fishermen could create blockades in the Channel after Brexit is finalised, the Express is reporting.An expert told the newspaper European fishermen are unlikely to be happy when fishing quotas are renegotiated.Barrie Deas, the CEO of the National Federation of Fishermens Organisations, said fishermen have blocked the Channel #for much lesser reasons than the UK becoming an independent coastal state#.#I think it would be naive to expect they will be happy about this or do nothing about it,# he said.#Theres a long history of those kinds of blockades.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince. He is a national embarrassment. When Princess Diana orced from Charles, she was immediately stripped of her HRH status yet the Prince of Sleaze keeps his. He should have his taken away without any further delay. Let him be Andrew Inverness, since he likes that name.The victims of Epstein will be scarred for le. If he has a scrap of decency left inside him, he will travel to the United States and tell the FBI all he knows.This is one trip for Air Miles Andy that the taxpayer would be prepared to pay for - especiallyit is a one-way ticket.       Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Scotland has a long-standing reputation of being an open and welcoming country.The UK is publishing the list of countries that English people can travel to later today.They had to restrict it just to England after Ms Sturgeon insisted that Scotland would have its own rules.She added it is very likely the Scottish Government will be able to agree the low-risk countries on the air bridge list over the next few days.Government sources had suggested there could be some overlap of the nations.Countries will be graded greenthey are safer than the UK, amberless safe, or red which means all passengers ing will have to isolate.The US will be on the red list, meaning self-quarantine measures will be required when ing to the UK.This morning the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explained the list of countries was finally ready and the nation could finally plan to get away.He told Sky News: There will be a list of -plus countries. If you add in the overseas territories-something-or-other that will be announced later today.The Sun earlier revealed the new rules will not apply to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who have decided to assess countries’ safety using dferent measures.Evencitizens fly out from England, their devolved administrations will require they quarantine on .This morning Mr Shapps revealed he still hoped the devolved nations would come around to the plans.He said: At the beginning of the week I said this would be announced by the end of the week, I was hoping to be able to do it earlier, but unfortunately we have not been able to get the devolved administrations to sign up to it yet. People have been waiting for this list all week, and thats why we delayed putting the list out there, to seethe devolved nations wanted to announce at the same time.Its not coming in until th of July, the end of the quarantine, so there is still time for other parts of the four nations to join.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One source familiar with the proposal said: A six-month stamp duty holiday would save people lots of money, is very Thatcherite and would please Tory backbenchers.The move would mirror the popular measure introduced by ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond in  when he removed stamp duty for all first-time buyers on homes under £, and £, in London.Another measure being looked at is removing stamp duty land taxon vacant land. The move is designed to take advantage of disused land to boost the development of new house-building projects.Both forms of stamp duty cuts are unlikely to be announced in the economic statement Mr Sunak is giving next week, which will instead focus on the Governments plan  to tackle mass youth unemployment triggered by the coronavirus crisis.The Treasury declined to comment.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly. Many of the NHS staff tell us they were just doing their jobs and that was their purpose in le.For the nurses and doctors, looking after people is a calling.This is our chance to show how grateful we are that they followed that calling and stay true to it — even when their lives are in danger.Of course, this is not a celebration, because people are still passing away and carers are still being put in danger.Tonight we would like people to put some kind of light in their window, an electric one rather than a candle, and to pause for reflection.Many landmarks will also be lit up in blue as we remember the thousands who have lost their lives.The other reason why this weekend is a good time to come together again is that there have been signs of a ide in the nation. We also need to remember that we are not over coronavirus  yet.We don’t know what is going to happen and there is a risk that there will be a second spike.We have already seen in Leicester that a fresh lockdown was needed and people are still dying.News is changing so fast and there is so much uncertainty.The Together coalition, which I am part of, hopes we can bring back that special spirit that helped us get through the worst of the crisis.We hope that Sunday can be a positive spark.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Im surprised, it would make sense to, with the charges against his ex-girlfriend you would assume that would be enough to warrant some kind of search of the ranch.Zorro Ranch includes many bedrooms, an indoor pool, log cabin, stables, and even its own airstrip, along with an antique railroad car and train tracks.Epsteins madam Maxwell, who was busted at a million hideaway on Thursday in Bradford, New Hampshire, is said to have been a regular visitor to the property on his private jet, with former employee Deidre Stratton describing naked photographs of her and young girls on the walls.She previously claimed: Ghislaine thought she was quite the photographer, and there would be photographs of, you know, like breasts, and not necessarily who they were attached to.I remember this one photo of ... I think two other girls in a bathtub, and they were naked.She alleged Prince Andrew stayed at the home with a mystery woman in , while victims have spoken out about how they were raped and sexually assaulted on the premises.Andrew strongly denies any allegations of sexual misconduct made against him.Deidre admits she knew Epstein liked massages, and once scared a young woman off, but was in the dark about the true extent of his sordid behavior.Meanwhile, Ean says he is shocked by Ghislaines location after she was arrested in New Hampshire, saying: I assumed shed be on an island or something, not in the US.The sad part isshes put in prison shell probably get good treatment because shes rich, right  Hopefully thats not the case, but well see.The Sun has contacted The FBI in New Mexico and Karen and Brice Gordon for comment.Ghislaine Maxwell denies all allegations of sexual misconduct made against her.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Like us on Facebook at www.facebook TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This results in excessive strain on the neck, a rounder shoulder and often counter strain in dferent parts of the body such as increased lower back pain and shortened hamstrings.Staring at screens all day can cause computer vision syndrome, otherwise known as digital eye strain.This results in dry, inflamed and bloodshot eyes, as well as eye irritation, redness and blurred vision.Over time, it can negatively impact our eyesight.A lack of physical exercise and too much time spent with poor posture in front of a screen can result in a hyper-extended neck, rounded shoulders and a hunchback that develops over time.Bashing away on a keyboard over long periods of time can lead to repetitive typing strain in your hands and wrists that can signicantly worsen and result in poor posture in other parts of the body.Vitamin D is mostly absorbed from sun exposure, so working indoors all day can leave the body deficient which can cause hair loss and new hair growth can be signicantly stunted.Staring at multiple screens while working all day can cause dark circles to form in the skin under your eyes, leaving you looking tired and haggard after prolonged periods.Squinting at a screen all day can increase the onset of premature lines forming beneath the surface of the skin, leading to wrinkles.Working inside and lack of sunlight can result in pale, dull and malnourished looking skin.Working from home often means less human contact than in the office that can lead to increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which raises blood pressure and has harmful effects on physical health.Overworking leads to chronic stress producing high levels of adrenaline and cortisol, associated with chronic health conditions and cardiovascular disease.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Hong Kong was British for  years, from  to , and it was handed back to China on the understanding that Hong Kong’s unique freedoms would remain unchanged for  years. One country, two systems was the promise.China has trashed that promise. There is one country now — tyrannical communist China where you kowtow to the party line or face the consequences. It is now illegal to sing the wrong song in Hong Kong. It is now a criminal offence to carry the wrong flag. Demanding basic human freedoms that we take for granted — and were also the norm in Hong Kong — will now get you jail time without even the pretence of anything resembling a fair trial.As the free world struggles with crashing economies, soaring unemployment and horric corona­virus death tolls, communist dictators are reverting to the law of the secret police and kang­aroo court, the baton and tear gas and terror.The old men in Beijing love to say that outside agencies are interfering in Hong Kong’s internal policies. But the simple truth is that the young people of Hong Kong — all born after the Union Jack came down — have grown up with freedoms that are un­known on mainland China. They do not want to live under a soul-destroying communist regime.That is why, at every attempt to roll back their freedoms and make Hong Kong as servile as every other part of China, the youngsters of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to protest in their millions. That is why riot police are currently arresting children in Hong Kong. Because they want to be free.President Xi’s National Security Law allows communist China to crush dissent in any way China sees fit. Likewise, President Putin’s referendum marginalises the millions of Russians who would love to see the back of the floundering KGB hardman.Millions of ordinary Russians and Hong Kongers have seen their freedoms eroded this week.And although the UK has problems of its own, we should do everything in our power to stand up to these old communist thugs who rule Russia and China. Don’t do business with them, for starters. And when teenagers are being rounded up on the streets of Hong Kong, we should not be asking a Chinese tech firm to build our mobile network.British history teaches us you can never appease a murderous bullyEnraging Beijing, a poll shows the British public are in favour of offering Hong Kong residents holding British National Overseas passports a home in the UK.So much for a post-Brexit UK that closes its borders to the world.So much for the racist, intolerant, xenophobic country we are supposed to be.This has been a rotten week for freedom. But in the darkness, there is a light — the decency, generosity and tolerance of the freedom-loving British people.And it is a light that will never go out.KATIE BOULTER, the golden girl of British tennis, says she is spending the cancelled Wimbledon fortnight watching the BBC crime series Killing Eve, which stars Jodie Comer – who many suggest is Katie’s doppelganger.The blonde bombshell of the baseline, above, says: “My brother recently said that to me. He was like – you definitely look like her. You’ve got to watch this box set. It’s unbelievable!”I do hope Katie is not disappointed. No series ever went downhill as fast as Killing Eve.The first series was great.Then Phoebe Waller-Bridge bailed out and the second series was mediocre. And then the third series was unwatchable.Killing Eve  Personally, I would prefer to be watching Katie Boulter on the Centre Court at Wimbledon.Seems a trle optimistic, not to mention deluded.I remember standing among the crowds on that sun-drenched wedding day in Windsor and feeling the love and goodwill for the happy couple.As they marinate in self-pity and self-importance in their Hollywood mansion, I wonderMeghan and Harry will ever understand the value of all that love and goodwill they chucked away.Because it felt priceless.Ian Driver, , is the former Green Party councillor who admits scrawling “racist” on the wall of a Charles Dickens museum in Broadstairs, Kent, causing £, of criminal damage.But Charles Dickens was famously progressive – he cared deeply about the poor, he cared deeply about social injustice and he campaigned against capital punishment in an age when public hangings were entertainment for the masses. Dickens’ experience of watching a hanging at Newgate informs the end of Oliver Twist, when Fagin is hanged – it is only in Lionel Bart’s cheerful musical Oliver! that Fagin gets to dance off into the sunset.With his profound sympathy for the oppressed, the average Victorian would have considered Charles Dickens decidedly “woke”.The character of Fagin in Oliver Twist – my favourite Dickens novel – is meant to be evidence of Dickens’ racism.But Fagin is Jewish – there is nothing anti-Semitic about his portrayal.Has this elderly Green Party graffiti artist actually read any Dickens  If not, he doesn’t know what he is missing.Nobody  has created the range of dazzling characters that poured out of Dickens’ imagination – Scrooge, Fagin, Oliver Twist, Miss Havisham, Mr Bumble, the Artful Dodger, Bill Sikes.Every writer in the English language lives in the shadow of Charles Dickens.This big-hearted genius enriched the language, the world and the imagination of generations.Calling him a racist is pig ignorant.Dickens lived and died in Victorian England.Expecting him to think exactly like a st-century Twitter user hardly seems fair.In fact, it hardly seems sane.THE UK and Japan are both tea-drinking monarchies.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, on its nd birthday, we have the chance not just to celebrate it but to reflect on what it means to us. My mum was a nurse, but she was also very ill for much of her le. The NHS she served and loved was also her leline. When I remember the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses who cared for her, I feel a deep sense of gratitude. It is what inspires me to fight for our health system, to ensure that kind of care will always be available to everyone. I know many others feel the same. The NHS means so much to so many. But in the last few months, as we have battled the coronavirus, it has become even more important. The impact of Covid- across our country has been devastating. Friends and families have been kept apart and tens of thousands of lives have been taken too early, including hundreds of NHS workers. At the centre of this storm, our NHS has been a rock. For every le tragically lost, many more have been saved by the actions of our NHS heroes.  I know it has been incredibly hard for those on the front line. Day in, day out, they put themselves in harm’s way to save others. We must never forget who our key workers are. For them, it’s more than a job. Their deep sense of public service and desire to help people in need shine through. They are the best of us. That’s why Labour supports those calling on the Government to make an immediate commitment to talks on a pay rise for NHS workers, and to agree this deal as soon as possible. The numbers of deaths are, at last, coming down. But Covid- has not gone away. The threat from the virus is still very real.  Throughout this crisis, the Government has been too slow. Too slow into lockdown, too slow to ramp up testing, too slow to fix the test-and-trace system and much too slow to get PPE to the front line of the NHS. The situation we saw in Leicester this week shows that the Government has still not got a grip on quickly identying and containing local outbreaks. We need to remain vigilant and do everything we can to protect and support our NHS.  That’s why Labour is calling on ministers to publish an NHS winter resilience plan, with free flu jabs for over-s, weekly coronavirus testing for NHS and social care staff, and proper stockpiling of PPE. The Government must learn from the mistakes made in their response to the virus so far and help the NHS prepare for winter. That includes facing up to the scandal that allowed the virus to ravage our care homes. We need to eliminate the virus from care homes before winter sets in.

Hairdressers are snipping away happily behind visors, and Independence Day drinkers, by and large, behaved themselves. After three months without pubs, a few hangovers can be forgiven this morning. Yesterday was our first taste of the new normal. Andwe are to keep on top of this virus, we had better get used to it. New freedoms, albeit limited ones, bring with them new responsibilities. At last we can go out for a drink and a bite to eat, mingle with friends, pitch a tent or go to the cinema. But as we get together, we must continue to stay apart. Forget the rules and Covid- will be back with a vengeance – and we will be back in lockdown. Going out and about under these new conditions will not exactly ignite our economy, but at least it will get it smouldering again. Jobs will still be lost, but we might just avoid the disaster of four million of them disappearing by Christmas.Embracing the new normal with caution means Health Secretary Matt Hancock can take a back seat as Rishi Sunak takes the steering wheel. It will be the biggest test a Chancellor has ever faced and, in Mr Sunak, we have a painfully inexperienced one. But, so far, he has made fewer mistakes than his boss Boris Johnson – although the furlough scheme he introduced should have been more flexible from the start.On Wednesday, he will unveil a package designed to help Britain get back to work. But we will have to wait until his Autumn Budget for the big announcements. We urge him to be bold. So much has already changed that so much more can. He can reform a tax regime that has benefited the wealthy for too long. He can make pensions fairer. And he can iron out the Universal Credit mess which caused such misery."},{"url":null,"title":"doctors told ibs hour later","story":"NewsDoctors told me I had IBS, an hour later I gave birth to baby girl in the toiletEXCLUSIVE: Fitness-mad mum Charlotte Wheeler-Smith, , welcomed perfect baby girl in just three pushes after doing a km run, km walk and cycling sessionShareCommentsByKelly Jenkins:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsCharlotte Wheeler-Smith, Dominic and their baby Evelyn Rose - whose arrival was a complete surprise \", url\"News, views and top stories .

Lawyer Charlotte, , had done a km run, a km walk and a session with a personal trainer when the niggling pain kicked in.Incredibly, her doctor made a house call to examine Charlotte, and he said it was most likely trapped wind or irritable bowel syndrome.But just an hour later Charlotte suddenly went into labour. She was about to give birth – yet didn’t even know she was pregnant. A wave of panic and mixed emotions swept over her but Charlotte still stayed cool. She phoned boyfriend Dominic – who was out on a run – then an ambulance. Dominic got back in time for Charlotte to give birth in just three pushes. But little Evelyn Rose was born breach and Charlotte suffered an umbilical cord prolapse, meaning her baby was starved of oxygen. Charlotte says: “I had absolutely no idea I was pregnant. The only signs were stomach cramps two days before she was born. “I thought I’d eaten something bad, or it was period pains, but I called a doctor on the morning before she was born, to be sure. “He visited and said I had trapped gas and IBS. Then an hour later, I went to the toilet and an umbilical cord fell out of me. I could not believe what was happening. “I got a sudden urge to push, then two little feet popped out. I was astonished, but I knew from watching One Born Every Minute that an umbilical cord coming out first is not good, because the baby is being starved of oxygen. “And a breach delivery is harder. So I knew that I had to push with everything I had. “I was strangely calm. I just knew I had to get our baby out.” Evelyn Rose was born in a corridor at Dominic’s flat in Amsterdam, where he and fellow Londoner Charlotte live. Dominic, , picks up the story: “We’d called an ambulance, but I saw the little legs and, at this point, it’s just me and Charlotte.  “I rang the emergency services back and said, ‘You’ve got to get here now, guys!’ Charlotte is standing there, holding on to the legs. She pushed once, and it was half way up the baby’s calves, she pushed again and it was up to the hips. “With the final push, the baby dropped out. Just three pushes. Charlotte grabbed her and passed her to me. She was really floppy and blue. Then we started chest compressions and tried to get air into her. “In the meantime, the ambulance crew turned up and started working on her.” Charlotte continues: “I shouted, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s a little girl.’ I’ve always wanted a little girl – a mini- me. I looked at her and she was so beautul, with dark curly hair. I shouted, ‘Is she alive ’ I really thought at that moment she was dead. Dominic had given her CPR that he remembered being taught in primary school. She was whisked away in an ambulance and we were taken in another. “I didn’t knowshe was alive or dead. Then the emotional rollercoaster started. As a woman who has just had a baby, your emotions are all over the place – I desperately wanted her to survive.” The couple – reeling from the shock of having a baby at all – faced an anxious wait to find outEvelyn was brain damaged. Charlotte adds: “Five days later, the neurosurgeon came back and said to the doctor, ‘Have you sent me the correct scan, because this baby’s brain is absolutely fine.’ She has no brain damage at all – a real miracle given the way she was born. We were so relieved, I burst into tears. We are so, so lucky to have her. She’s a dream come true. “Being able to hold her for the first time four days after her birth was the best feeling in the world. It felt amazing and so special.” Two-week-old Evelyn is recovering well and has been moved out of ICU and on to the children’s ward. To say Charlotte was stunned to become a mum is an understatement.  She had no baby bump and had been having regular periods. Evelyn’s arrival came after a worrying time for Charlotte, who was overweight in her s and feared that might prevent her having children. “I was  stone and my periods were very irregular, so I knew falling pregnant would be a struggle,” she says. In , after a diplomatic word from a friend, Charlotte joined Slimming World, started working out and lost a whopping st in  months – dropping from a size  to size -. She now writes a blog about her weight loss journey, called Slimming and the City, and shares exercise and recipe tips. In , she met Dominic on Tinder and embarked on a long-distance romance with the telecommunications company director, who has lived in Amsterdam for  years.  While they had discussed marriage and children, neither was prepared for the shock birth of baby Evelyn. Charlotte adds: “Because of lockdown, we’d been apart for  weeks, so when I got to Amsterdam three weeks ago, we had a lovely reunion. “Who could have guessed just a few weeks later we would be parents ” Luckily, Charlotte is not a big drinker and hadn’t been consuming much alcohol during her pregnancy. She exercised vigorously daily – running, indoor cycling, exercise classes – and travelled quite a bit too. She goes on: “I feel really guilty I didn’t realise I was pregnant, when I think of the things I have done while she was in my tummy.  “Crazy exercise, personal training sessions. All the travel. “I went to Dubai in February and ended up playing Uno and drinking Hennessey Paradis – which is £, a bottle – with Tottenham footballer Dele Alli on the flight. Luckily that was the only time I really drank. Drinking for me is a single glass of Prosecco on a Friday night. “I also had surgery when I was two months pregnant – a breast uplt and skin removal after losing so much weight. They did a pregnancy test, but it came back negative! “Two days before I gave birth, I started with a run, followed by a walk and an online training session. “Then I worked and cycled into Amsterdam to go to the pub. Two days later, Evelyn Rose was born. Our little miracle. I’m so, so proud of my body and all it has achieved.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy who touched comedy stars","story":"NewsBoy who touched comedy stars hearts now in Mexico for last chance to save his leCharlie, , has battled medulloblastoma since he was eight and won support from John Bishop, fellow comedian Katherine Ryan and actor Chris O’Dowd at a Stand Up To Cancer eventShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  JUL NewsCharlie out after his latest round of treatment in Mexico \", url\"News, views and top stories .

Mum Toni Ilsley raised £, to take son Charlie abroad – though doing so in the Covid- pandemic petried her. Charlie, , has battled medulloblastoma – the highest-grade brain tumour for children – since he was eight. In January he was given months to live. Parents Toni and Mark, , are clinging to the hope that a three-week trial at the Williams’ Cancer Institute in Mexico City can offer a miracle cure. He is midway through treatment led by Dr Jason Williams. It uses a protein in the body to attack tumorous cells. Pharmacist technician Toni, , said from Mexico: “No one at such a young age should be going through what he’s had to endure. Learning the NHS could do no more almost destroyed us. “We were getting to the point doctors said he wouldn’t live past – but thankfully we scraped the funds to get to Mexico. I was petried to take Charlie but told myselfI don’t, he will die. It’s his last chance. So far, so good, though it’s too early to say. Charlie is in good spirits and swimming between therapy.”  The family has won support from John Bishop, fellow comedian Katherine Ryan and actor Chris O’Dowd. They met at a Stand Up To Cancer event which helped raise £, to send Charlie to Turkey for CyberKne radiotherapy treatment. That was in  – after Charlie’s brain tumours spread. The treatment worked, he was declared cancer-free but the cruel disease ed last November.  Mum-of-three Toni, from Henley, Oxfordshire, says she was told no more could be done. She said: “I went into shock, I couldn’t eat or sleep. We tried to make it the best Christmas, knowing it could be his last.” With the NHS offering palliative chemo, the family went private – paying £, so Charlie could get drugs through a reservoir inserted under his scalp. But after one of four treatments, appointments were halted due to Covid-.  Toni said: “Every door was closing. I researched America and Turkey, but the pandemic made it hard to find anyone to treat Charlie. Finding Doctor Williams was a miracle. I sent Charlie’s scans and we spoke for hours on Skype. Eventually, he said Charlie was eligible.”  Arriving in Mexico brought its own drama – earthquake tremors hurtling Charlie across a room as he lay in bed. “We thought we would die,” said Toni.

The smiling punter, in a Wetherspoons pub in Central London, grinned at the camera before the necking the drink. One Twitter user voiced her approval, writing: I love the fact he casually downed a jägerbomb live on the BBC at am in the morning. It comes as boozers brace for their busiest night of the year, with businesses allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. But with the R rate now feared to be above  in London - meaning the number of new Covid- cases could be rising - experts have called on boozers to be careful. Professor Chris Whitty yesterday warned that reopening pubs and other businesses on aposSuper Saturdayapos is aposabsolutely not risk freeapos as lockdown is eased in England. Drinkers voiced their excitement after being served their first pints. One Manchester pubgoer named Jimmy said his first Carling was like an angel p***ing on the tip of me tongue, while north London punter Andrew Slawinski said first pub pint was like winning the [Premier] League. Builder Ben Clark, from Newcastle, and two friends queued outside the Briar Rose in Birmingham city centre before it reopened at am. They were covered in dust after a night sht at a building site as they stood on social distancing markers. Mr Clark, , told BirminghamLive: Weaposve just finished night shts. Iaposve been watching the pubs since am this morning, when we came and reserved our tables ready for the pub opening ready for a pint of San Miguel and a breakfast.  Pubs were given the green light to reopen from am, but many boozers waited until am to throw open their doors. Most didnapost see an immediate rush of customers and some chains decided to remain closed. The reopening has been welcomed by customers, but it comes with a stark warning of the danger pubs present in superspreading Covid- and criticism of Boris Johnsonaposs easing of the lockdown.  Amid fears the reopening could fuel trouble, West Midlands Labour police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said it was very bad timing by the government to pick a Saturday night and admitted he was praying for rain. He had suggested that it would be more appropriate to open pubs on a Monday. Police forces across England were planning to deploy additional patrols.

The former steel town of Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh valleys has a weekly infection rate of  compared to  in the Covid hotspot of Leicester. Public Health Wales say the high rate in the Welsh town is due to a cluster of  cases among workers at a meat-processing plant. They say the cluster is under constant review - and it is a dferent situation from the spread among people in the Midlands city. This does not mean that there has been a signicant increase in the level of infection in the community, said a PHW spokesperson. The former industrial town of Merthyr has a population of just , compared to over , in Leicester. It has large pockets of poverty and is often at the bottom of employment and economy ratings in Wales. Health officials says the rise to the weekly infection rate of  is due to testing after confirmed cases at the Kepak meat factory in the town - and not that it is spreading outside. Non-essential shops in the town have been allowed to reopen.

Instead, the former solicitor has gone on to tackle some of the world’s most physically challenging races and has never let his degenerative condition stand in the way. Alex, now , has ­completed the ­notoriously tough Marathon des Sables in the searing heat of the Sahara Desert, pulled a lb sled across the Arctic in temperatures of -C and run  miles through the Amazon. Since , he has successfully ­completed  marathons and challenges. And the dad of three didn’t let up during lockdown either. He spent  hours a day for a whole week climbing ,ft – more than double the height of Mount Everest – using just his stairs to raise money for charity. So far, Alex’s amazing feats of physical endurance have raised more than £, for Parkinson’s UK and more than £, for charities worldwide. He says: “I have learned to accept the bad days, and give my all on the good. I want to raise £million for Parkinson’s UK in the hope of better treatments or even a cure one day.” Fitness fanatic Alex was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in  after he noticed his little finger moving involuntarily. Following a series of tests, he was told he had the incurable disease, which develops when cells that produce ­dopamine in the brain stop working and are lost over time. In the UK, around , people are living with Parkinson’s and a further two people are diagnosed every hour. There is no cure for the le-changing disease, and sufferers are forced to live with the knowledge that they will slowly lose control of their body as the ­illness progresses.  Alex recalls: “When the ­neurologist told me it was Parkinson’s, my le suddenly felt meaningless. “I was devoid of hope and my diagnosis weighed on me from the moment I woke to the moment I fell asleep. “My twitching finger was a constant physical reminder of the battle I couldn’t fight and wouldn’t win.” But after months of ­feeling both anger and ­despair, Alex realised that he couldn’t ­wallow. Instead, he focused on his work as a lawyer and ploughed all his energy into athletic events he’d planned to do ­before his diagnosis.  Alex continued training for the Marathon des Sables – a -mile race across the Sahara Desert, known as the “toughest footrace on the Earth”. During the event, Alex got lost and had to be rescued by local tribesmen. He then became seriously ill and had to pull out of the race due viral pericarditis – an ­infection of the sac surrounding the heart. Alex was ­gutted he had to quit, but still ­managed to raise £, for charity – which made him realise that his global adventures could really help other people. He says: “This led me to the MillionMetres challenge, which ­involves running, hiking, ­cycling, climbing and rowing ,km.” In , Alex ran  miles across the Alps in  hours, ­surviving on just  minutes’ sleep. And the following year, he ran from London to Rome via Brussels and Paris in  days.  In , he became the first person to cross America using four dferent disciplines – cycling, running, climbing and rowing – covering more than , miles in just  days. He also ran  miles across the Dolomite mountains in Italy and  miles of the Colorado Rockies. More recently, in , Alex took part in Fiji’s -mile Lost Island Ultra before completing the London Marathon a fortnight later. He also trained for Primal Quest in Canada – one of the toughest adventure races in the world. Despite suffering broken ribs, a concussion and a bulging disc in his spine, Alex and his team completed the challenge in four days and five hours. Later this year, he hopes to take part in Racing the Planet’s -mile six-stage ultramarathon on Namibia’s Skeleton Coast. Alex is also hoping to secure ­sponsorship to become the first person with Parkinson’s to climb Mount Everest for real – a challenge he hopes to have professionally filmed.  But in the meantime, from July , he’ll be ­running a -mile ultramarathon in  days for Parkinson’s UK in his home town of Wantage, Oxfordshire. Although Alex does his best to stay fit and healthy, the physical symptoms of his condition sometimes flare up, which he finds ­dficult to deal with. “When I have to walk like a robot or lose my voice, my world feels ­intrinsically smaller,” Alex says.  “It really affects my confidence to be a part of society ­because I don’t want the world to see my symptoms. “I know others with Parkinson’s feel this way, too.” It is this feeling that drives Alex to continue with his epic fundraising ­adventures around the globe. He says: “Being physically restricted at times has taught me to be resilient. “That doesn’t stop me feeling angry but I use that anger and hatred for Parkinson’s to do ­positive things, such as raising money for research. “This ­disease can zap your self-worth but you can keep doing what you want to do, evenit means finding an ­alternative way of doing it. “I have hope in better treatments for Parkinson’s being discovered.

Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, said: “The new model picked up Leicester as a consistent hotspot back on June .

Mark Adams, chief executive of Community Integrated Care, believes thousands would have been saved – and has slammed plans for weekly tests in England as “too little, too late”. To date, Office for National Statistics figures show , care home ­residents have died with Covid-. And Mr Adams’ claim suggests some , could still be alivea robust testing regime had limited outbreaks. Accusing the Government of abandoned residents, he said: “If the priority had been, ‘Let’s just test everybody that’s coming into contact with vulnerable people’, you probably would have more than halved the number you lost in a care home, and maybe even made it a fraction of what it has been. “The Government clearly started off thinking, ‘We’re all going to get this, there are going to be about , people who die’. They’re mainly going to be old people who potentially might have died anyway and they might even save the NHS and local authorities moneythey pop their clogs early’.” Mr Adams spoke after regular testing was finally announced for care home staff in England. He said without twice-weekly testing, care homes and supported living homes would be left completely unprepared for a second, third or fourth wave of the virus. He stressed that twice-weekly testing is needed to stop infected staff bringing Covid- into homes – with residents tested by local public health nurses rather than carers. Mr Adams said: “Dealing with ­vulnerable and confused people who might have dementia, that’s a horrendous experience for them to go through. You really need to have experienced nurses doing the testing now.   “Our organisation has  nurses across  locations. But a great many social care environments are run where you don’t have nursing staff – you have highly trained care workers.“The test has a % failure rate just on the science. But thenyou add the human error into that there’s a risk. The ideal scenario is public health teams would have a dedicated team who visit care homes.” Mr Adams warned the toll could rise much higherthe Government fails to also boost testing in supported living environments. He said: “We talk about the , in nursing and care homes. There’s , in supported living. “The fact that they’re in a dferent building doesn’t mean the complexity of their condition has changed. Every time the Government pats itself on the back about gradually getting its act together five months too late, they’re talking about care homes and nursing homes – they’re not talking about this army of people who are waiting to have support themselves.” Charities have also demanded beefed-up testing for agency staff. The ONS found infection rates were higher in homes that used agency staff who worked across several sites. Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, added: “Regular and routine testing is criticalwe are to garner a better understanding and keep at bay this virus. This initiative needs to be rolled out to all care homes, including adults with learning disabilities and also supported living.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hoarding worse during lockdown theres","story":"NewsHoarding much worse during lockdown and theres nowhere to hide from the clutterThe founder of Hoarding Disorders UK says that since March, the organisation’s helpline has seen a spike in calls.

But for around . ­million Brits, hoarding items is a serious issue, linked to anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. And for many sufferers, the lockdown has exacerbated the problem because staying at home means there is nowhere to hide from the clutter. Jo Cooke, founder of Hoarding Disorders UK, says that since March, the organisation’s helpline has seen a spike in calls. But what exactly is hoarding and what can be done to stop it   Hoarding – once dismissed as an extension of other mental health conditions – was officially recognised as a disorder in its own right by the World Health Organization in . The NHS describes it as ­someone acquiring an ­excessive number of items and storing them in a chaotic manner, resulting in huge amounts of clutter. These hoards often interfere with daily le and the use of the home, such as making the shower or kitchen inaccessible. They also cause distress to the sufferer and their family. Hoarded homes also pose a number of safety issues, ­particularlythere is a fire. The severity is measured by a visual guide known as the Clutter Image Rating. Who is affected   Around two to five per cent of Brits are thought to be hoarders to some degree, but the true number could be higher because sufferers are often too ashamed to talk about it. Jo says: “This is an ­anxiety disorder, not people who are lazy or dirty. “They have emotional ­attachments to things, often ­triggered by bereavement or trauma, such as redundancy or empty nest syndrome.” Seek some support Reaching out for help is a vital first step when it comes to ­treating the condition. There are currently around  support groups in the UK – and self-diagnosed hoarder Lynn Howells runs one in Berkshire, with the support of Jo. It was set up by Silva Homes, the housing association -year-old Lynn works for. And the group’s monthly meetings, which are now taking place online, provide emotional support as well as practical tips to curb hoarding behaviours and cope with family tensions. Lynn says: “I’ve bought or kept things ‘just in case’ my whole adult le, and I’ve traced it back to the upset of being sent to boarding school. “Volunteering to run the ­support group has helped me a lot. Everyone’s story is unique but it is a relief to realise you are not alone.” How to tackle a hoardIf you feel able to declutter, Jo recommends starting small.She says: “Begin in the least emotional area, such as the ­hallway. Build five minutes into your daily routine to start and focus on the benefits of ­creating a more al home.” Lynn says that setting rules helped her feel comfortable enough to let possessions go. She explains: “For a hoarder, items have a perceived value, whether monetary or emotional. You also worry about where they will end up.

This weekend is marking the biggest thank-you yet not only to the NHS and key workers, but also to all those in the community whose support has helped us get through the pandemic. The events will reach a climax with a nation-wide clap at pm on Sunday when people are being asked to come out again on their doorsteps or stop what they’re doingto applaud and then spend some time with neighbours and friends to reflect on those connections that continue to strengthen our communities as we move into the next stage of the crisis. Brits have put a candle or a light in their window to remember all those we have lost to Covid-. At pm the Dean of St Pauls lit a candle on the West End portico of the cathedral in London. Landmarks all across the country have been lit in NHS blue, supported by the #LightItBlue campaign. Number  Downing Street is lit up and a candle is placed on the doorstep to remember the hundreds of key workers who have list their lives during the pandemic.Windsor Castle, where The Queen is currently staying, is also lit in blue this evening.  Kenilworth Castle is another building paying tribute to the NHS. They tweeted: Tonight, weaposre supporting the NHS and Togetheraposs Moment of Remembrance. We remember those we have lost and pay tribute to NHS staff, key workers and everyone who has played their part during the pandemic. #lightitblue#thankyoutogether.  The famous clock at Londonaposs Waterloo station is also lit up in blue, the colour of the NHS. Lordaposs Cricket Ground tweeted: Weaposre lighting the Pavilion blue tonight.On the weekend of @NHSEngland aposs birthday, weaposre joining with other landmarks from across the UK to #LightItBlue as we remember those we have sadly lost during the pandemic.The Eden Project in Cornwall, the windmill in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, the arch at Wembley Stadium and The Royal Albert Hall are some other iconic venues to also light up blue tonight. And across the country, members of the public have lit candles and placed them in their windows in paying tribute to our heroes. One person tweeted: #NeverForgotten#LightItBlue for those we have loved and lost due to COVID . Another said: Remembering those we have sadly lost during the pandemic. Shining a light in my window #LightItBlue#ThankYouTogether. Thinking about all those who are no longer with us... Light a candle #LightItBlue#NHS#NHSBirthday, another said.  The Covid- outbreak has been the greatest challenge the NHS has faced since it was founded on  July . Premier League stars and match officials applauded healthcare professionals and other key workers before games kicked-off on Saturday afternoon. At pm on Sunday, broadcasters will suspend normal transmissions to encourage everybody to stop what they’re doing and join with othersin their streets or neighbourhoods to applaud not just the NHS and other key workers but all those who have volunteered or helped keep services and community networks going. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive, said: This year has been the most challenging in NHS history, with staff displaying extraordinary dedication, skill and compassion to care for the , patients with COVID- who needed specialist hospital treatment and many others besides. During this testing time our nurses, doctors, physios, pharmacists and countless more colleagues were sustained by the support of the public, not least through the weekly applause for key workers. No health service, not even the NHS, could have coped alone with this coronavirus pandemic. From bus drivers and teachers to care staff and food retailers and, of course, the public who took action to stay at home to stop infection spreading, everyone played their part. The NHS’s birthday this year not only offers the opportunity for us to say thank you to the nation, but for us all to come together at pm to pause and recognise all the work which has taken place in the last months and say a heartfelt thank you. The clap for carers at pm on a Thursday night became an established ritual during the Covid- plague – and a focal point for unity among neighbours, streets and whole towns. The idea for this weekendaposs tribute came from the newly founded Together coalition, which includes the CBI, trades unions, the Scouts and Guides. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “ My sincere hope is this weekend will serve as a powerful moment of remembrance, thanks and connection, as we come together and commit to helping to create kinder, closer more connected communities.” Others supporters include UK Sport, Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas and Baroness Doreen Lawrence. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: “Throughout its history the NHS has brought the whole country together, treating everyone based on need not ability to pay. So we’re honoured the Together coalition have chosen the NHS birthday to pull the country together.” Kwame Kwei-Armah, director of the Young Vic, said: “At a time when there is so much emphasis on what ides us, giving thanks and connecting with our communities is one of the things that unites us.” The last official Clap for Carers event was held on May .

The clip, shared with the Liverpool Echo, is believed to have been taken on May  - when police received calls of shots fired. The man, sporting a pair of pink and purple shorts and a T-shirt, is seen walking past several parked cars before appearing to enter a block of flats. It was taken in Ivy Avenue in Garston. In a statement after shots were reportedly fired, Merseyside Police said: We were contacted at .pmto reports loud bangs had been heard. A search of the area was carried out.  No damage was discovered and there were no reports of anyone being injured but casings were recovered. A further search of area will be carried out today.

In documents lodged at the High Court this week, the Duchess of Sussex has insisted she was left “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie. It’s the latest salvo fired in her continuing fight with a newspaper over published extracts of a letter she sent to dad Thomas. And the stress of their new le is also said to be taking its toll on Harry who is missing the close bond he once had with his brother Prince William. The relative of Meghan, who does not want to be named, told the Sunday Mirror: “She has gone very quiet. I think she is likely to be feeling extremely low and probably struggling.  “The legal battle and the increased tension it’s created with the royals due to the information that’s coming out has to be putting a lot of strain on them both. “Meghan’s been a lot more distant and introverted over the last few weeks – her family is worried. And Harry must be tormented by his fractured family ties. He was particularly down on William’s birthday on June .” This week it emerged -year-old Meghan has named in court papers five friends who gave an interview to US People magazine defending her and criticising her father.But she denies authorising them to do it.  She insisted her friends spoke to the magazine only because they were worried for her. Meghan also claimed she had been the subject of numerous damaging and distressing articles, with Kensington Palace ordering her to say nothing but “no comment”. Her legal document stated: “As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself.” The couple quit as frontline royals in January to move to Canada before settling in Los Angeles. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing extracts from the handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas, , in August . It was written three months after he was unable to walk her down the aisle following a heart attack. The former Suits actress claims the letter was private.  The newspaper says Mr Markle wanted its content published to correct any  impression her friends had given about what it contained when they gave their magazine interviews. Meghan has identied one of her five pals, Friend A, as the person who told People magazine the letter said: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. “Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.”  In court documents Meghan claimed this was an “unfortunately inaccurate” portrayal of her letter, insisting many times she had known nothing of her closest friends’ decision to go public. Her friends now face the prospect of having to testy on oath in the High Court that this is true. Meghan is also believed to have been hit hard by her spat with long-time pal Jessica Mulroney who was caught up in a race row last month.

They caused confusion among locals as to whether or not they fell into the boundary. Now Leicester City Police have tweeted a further version of the map which covers the same lockdown area but has all the affected zone shaded in pink.Are you affected by the Leicester lockdown  Email  webnews@mirrorThe police say the latest version is more viewer-friendly, LeicestershireLive reports.The force is currently running Operation Integrate where it is policing two parts of the county with separate legal status. Within the lockdown zone, that covers the whole city and some outlying areas pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas are not yet allowed to re-open and non-essential shops had to close again. Outside the zone all those businesses can stay open or re-open from today.  The Leicester Lockdown has been put in place to try to stop infection after a recent spike of Coronavirus cases in the city. Last week, residents in villages were left baffled as one side of the street was inside the boundary, but the other was not. In Scraptoft, Kathleen McDonagh, , will have to wait at least two weeks before she can go to the pub or the hair salon.  In contrast, Veronica Cayless, also , who lives opposite her, is free to head to her local now as she is outside of the lockdown boundary. Itaposs a similar situation in Thurncourt, another area in Leicester. Residents in the lockdown boundary are separated by just a wooden picket fence. It has caused confusion for Helen Bale, , who lives inside the lockdown zone, but works outside of it.  My boss called me and said how does it fall for you  If I donapost go in, I donapost get paid. I just donapost see how it is going to work, she told Mail Online. Neighbour Lisa Jones, , was also left confused by the measures as she too lives in the lockdown area but isnapost sureshe can cross the other side of the fence to go to the essential shops. Images of deserted streets in Leicester show the stark reality of a city forced into local lockdown.  Photographs taken last week show city centre streets, previously bustling, now almost completely empty.

A spokeswoman for the company said: We welcome the news that pubs, alongside other hospitality venues, can reopen from next month. Pubs play an important role at the very heart of their communities and have been sorely missed by customers as well as those who work in them. We look forward to welcoming back customers to our pubs and providing that great hospitable pub experience we all love. Wetherspoon is set to reopen hundreds of its UK establishments on Saturday despite fierce debate.But Greene King says it wants to ensure its restaurants have safe socialising layouts. The spokeswoman added: Not all our pubs will be viable to open immediately, even with the reduction in social distancing guidance to one metre alongside additional measures, but we expect to open ,, over two-thirds of our managed estate in phase one. We are working on the re-opening date for the second phase and will confirm it as soon as we can. The safety of our team and customers is our top priority and we are confident the measures we are introducing outlined in our PUBSAFE promises will mean our pubs will operate safely for both customers and team members.

Jessica Elsey has the shock of her le when she discovered she was expecting triplets - and that she would be raising them solo. When she first discovered she was pregnant, Jessica was living in London and the now -year-old was really enjoying the le she had carved out for herself. She had a great job in the charity sector which enabled her to travel around the country, she had also been to university and taught and taken part in voluntary work in Zambia for three months. Then, one night, when visiting Cornwall, what was supposed to be a harmless evening of making pancakes, turned into making triplets. Jessica, who lives in Polgooth near St Austell, said despite the struggles of being outnumbered by toddlers, the financial dficulties of raising a young family alone and trying to find time for her own dreams, she says she wouldn’t change a thing and wants to encourage other women to support each other.She told CornwallLive : “I grew up in a nice village. Growing up I had two married, ambitious parents, a little sister, we had a dog, two cats, guinea pigs, a hamster, a rabbit, and a good house – the lot.“We had a nice le and came from a nice area and I really didn’t intend to get pregnant out of the blue like that.” Within three weeks her pregnancy symptoms were causing her a lot of pain. She attended an emergency appointment and from there she was sent to the early pregnancy unit fearing the worst. “That was awful. It was a really hot day and I was sat with my back to the window and there was a chill in the air,” she said. “I was surrounded by women losing their babies and I was becoming more aware as the hours that went by, that most people who are sent there come out with heart-breaking news.” At her first appointment she was told that, although her pregnancy hormone levels were high, doctors couldn’t find any signs of le. During a second appointment she was told they found twins, but there were no heartbeats. “It was a really confusing time - the doctors were confused, my hormone levels were still too high for it to make sense,” she said. They also asked hershe had pain in her shoulder, a symptom of ectopic pregnancy. “Here I am, shocked that I’m even pregnant, and now I’m mourning two babies, that I wasn’t ever expecting to have in the first place, and Googling ‘what happens when you have an ectopic pregnancy ’. “I didn’t know what to feel, or what I had a right to feel and I was scared about all the possible outcomes.” By the time she was only five weeks pregnant - after multiple tests and hours spent with doctors and nurses - Jessica was told there was not one, not two but three viable pregnancies. In a state of shock, she literally swore at the nurse and burst in to laughter. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “I was so glad I had the support of my best friend when I found out, who had travelled to London to be there,” she said. “And I wish my reaction was more pleasant than it was, but I was already convinced that my two babies hadn’t made it and I was coming to terms with that.” “I remember thinking ‘this never happens to people’,” she said. “One child is incredible and when people tell me they are pregnant I think it’s amazing. Your body is literally making a child. It’s the most beautul and natural thing.” In the space of a few short weeks Jessica went from a single, career-driven women who didn’t want children to finding out she was pregnant, then being told she might not be, then that she was having twins but they might not have survived and then finally being told she was expecting healthy triplets. “The whole time until they were born I just thought they were going to die. I didn’t want to be pregnant at first and I also didn’t think I would ever have children, let alone this,” she said. Despite the terrying news, Jessica says having an abortion was never really an option, even during a discussion about foetal reduction . “Nobody should feel the need to justy themselves, especially on why they have aborted or reduced a pregnancy – they will have good reason and that’s personal to them,” she said. “But for me I just couldn’t work out why I, personally, would do it. Of course there were reasons. The doctors told me that it’ll be very expensive to raise them but this just wasn’t enough for me. “My little babies and I had already been through so much. It had already been so emotional. I knew that the three little balls of cells inside me, that were developing each day, had so much potential and I personally don’t have the strength to think ‘what  ’ for my entire le. She added: I had been blessed and I owed them the chance, my babies had already given me so much strength. Jessica had a dficult pregnancy. There was countless hospital admissions, severe morning sickness , severely low iron levels and signs her babies were coming early at  weeks, when they would have no chance of survival outside the womb. She had dual care between London and Cornwall but spent most of the time  miles away from her family and continued to work up until the day she went into labour at  weeks pregnant. She and the father had also completely parted ways. Her three boys, Arthur, Brodie and Carter - who are now two and a half years old - were welcomed after a long day of labour by emergency C-section in October  and, to the surprise of medical staff, they were really healthy for triplets. The babies were born in London and after just a couple of hard weeks alone in the neonatal ward, Jessica and her boys travelled back with her mother while they looked for a home. She says this was the most challenging time of her le. Jessica was feeding all three boys every three hours, which could have been up to  hours a day – and they were exclusively breast fed until they were almost a year old. Feeding all three would take two hours total, leave her with less than an hour between feeds.  “It was a huge challenge,” she said. “But it is the best thing I have ever done, something I’m immensely proud of my body for doing.” Getting out in the early days, without a car was also really dficult for them. She said: “I would feed them before I’d leave anywhere but would always have to feed them in public too. I’ve been seen on the side of the road feeding, in cafes, on the bus, on trains, on the beach, anywhere. “The amazing thing about breast feeding is it is so versatile. At home, I’d have one baby on each breast, then one in the bouncer until a baby was done and swap.” When they were just three weeks old, they gained the keys to their own home and Jessica and her little boys were no longer homeless. She said that a common misconception is that she must be organised as a mother of triplets, but in reality she is really relaxed about how she raises the boys. “I’m not going to pretend I am organised.  There are a lot of things you can do with one or even two that you really have to think about when you have got three.” Sometimes she says she is shocked when people pass them while out and about and say things like ‘rather you than me’  and when doing their food shop she says they can get stopped up to  times. “We get some odd comments, she said. I do worry when the boys are older how they might take these things, as they can sometimes be hurtful, or not even make sense. “But this is a blessing and I can let it go because people are just being friendly most of the time. But you do sometimes feel like your family is a bit of a circus. “And I do know how very blessed I am. We also get ‘wow’ and ‘aren’t you a lucky mummy’ which is lovely and I would never want anyone to feel they couldn’t stop me. But by the th time, when you are trying to pack your shopping in the supermarket and there are three of them running around with people trying to ask me about how they were made,it was IVF, and also telling me they are tearing the chocolate off the shelves, it can be a bit much.” Jessica says the secret to motherhood for her has been about working on each challenge as it comes, without worrying about the future and learning to accept help. “I would not be able to be half the mother I am without our support of incredible, hardworking, strong, kind, people, not least my mother,” she said. “I just try to enjoy it and learn from each lesson. Before they were crawling, there was no point worrying about when they would start crawling. It is all about living each day as it comes and enjoying it. You can’t second guess toddlers and every time I got good at something, or found a parenting hack, they would develop.”Alongside raising the boys, Jessica is studying for a degree to be a teacher and a diploma to be a forest school leader and she also documents her le on her Instagram account.Because of how open she is, she has also never been afraid to share the hardships of motherhood and has been transparent about some of their financial struggles over the past few months.  “We have recently found things tough and challenging, particularly, during lockdown. Living as a one parent family, with three toddlers whose idea of fun is to decorate my walls and break furniture,” she said. “We started the journey homeless and have had some incredible support from the village, family and friends. I think anybody will be able to relate to how much children cost. You just can’t imagine it,” she said. “We’re lucky to live in Cornwall because going to the beach and the forest is generally free, but it is dficult,you can’t afford the parking. She added: “I know that my family are among the many living in poverty in Cornwall, but I’m doing my best.” There have been times where she has considered giving up studying altogether and getting a lower-paid job, or moving back to London for more money, but she is determined to carry on with her studies in order to have a better future. “There have definitely been days, every day, where I questionI’m doing the right thing by my children by continuing to study,” she said. “However my mum studied when we were younger, and I see other studying single mothers who inspire me. We support each other and each assignment we get back, we are sure it’s the right decision. The last assignment I achieved a high first, during lockdown. “My studying single friends have also achieved so much, I am so blessed to be connected with strong supportive women.” Until recently, Jessica and the boys had gone without a TV for the majority of lockdown and people were amazed at how they had been coping. She also went over two years without a dishwasher, and would have continuedshe wasn’t kindly donated one. “I can’t afford things like a lot of families can, like how I grew up, like a second-hand dishwasher and brand new clothes for my boys. These are things I can’t ever contemplate doing,” she said. “I can’t afford a nice car or even a car big enough for my family. Being a single mum is dficult for many reasons but I’m in no way saying it’s not dficult for others too. I can’t just go out and spend money on a TV or a brand new mattress and new beds for the boys like some people can and I am okay with that.” As soon as they entered lockdown everything went wrong at once in their household. The car broke twice, the toaster and washing machine packed-up and the tumble dryer is now on its last legs. The boys ‘decorated’ the walls and carpets throughout the house and the bathroom flooded which kept tripping the electrics meaning all the food in the fridge-freezer was constantly going off. She has also had to use a food bank a couple times for her family and says she was in shock when her electricity bill went up by £ a month because of the amount of time they were spending at home. But after weeks of struggling she was encouraged by her supporters, who wanted to help, to set up a fundraiser. “I was so embarrassed.” She said. “Things had to get really bad to do that but people are amazing. I know there are so many more problems in the world right now. I’m really very aware of other causes due to managing within the charity sector for four years before the babies.   “And not to say I’m Mother Theresa, but online my page has been shared by people mocking my efforts to better my children’s lives, suggesting I’m unaware of other causes.“But I do love doing things for others myself. I love the strength people who have supported us have given me and my family. I almost feel guilty for not asking for help sooner. It’s like I was being too proud or something but I am far more proud of the community, my friends, family and even people who do not know us. “My children have taught me many things, but the biggest thing they have taught me is that there is no shame in asking for help and it wasn’t until people started donating and sending us things that I realised how much we really actually needed it. “Because of peoples generosity my children have been able to eat, play, have warm milk and toast. This mummy has not quite been able to relax, but I have been a lot less stressed than I could have been, so I thank everyone so, so much.” She added: “The greatest joys of raising them come from the hardships. All of my children are extremely magical and gorgeous in their own ways and their personalities develop daily which is quite special to watch. “They all love being outside in the forest, rivers, and sea we are extremely lucky to be blessed with the nature we live around and can play in. It is so hard to allow them to be free and wild because you’re scared they’ll fall and hurt themselves but the greatest joy is watching them achieve something they didn’t think they could.

Mark “Billy” Billingham, a star of SAS Who Dares Wins, spoke out following the death of special forces medic Staff Sgt Jamie Ferguson, , who shot himself on an Army base last month. The Sunday People revealed he made a video saying: “I asked for help but no one was ­listening. They didn’t understand.” His widow Sammi, , who had a son with Jamie, and two daughters from another marriage, wants the Government to admit there is a problem with suicide in veterans’ and hold a full and open investigation into her husband’s death. Billy, , said: “It’s an absolute tragedy. You are not going to ­prevent all deaths but surely the MoD and the Army can do far more. It’s clear the MoD doesn’t care – once you’re out of the door it’s clear you are not its problem and that’s wrong. “The MoD doesn’t know how many veterans are killing themselves and that’s disgraceful – that ­disgusts me.” Staff Sgt Ferguson, originally from Leicestershire, joined up at  and was in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Among the hundreds of lives he saved with the SAS in Iraq and Afghanistan were victims of a  checkpoint ambush by a rogue Afghan cop in Helmand.  He was treated for post-traumatic stress last year after failing to save a soldier trampled by an ­elephant in an anti-poaching ­operation in Malawi. MPs last week told the Sunday People his ­suicide, at Leuchars Military Base, Fe, should be a “catalyst for change” for the way that the MoD treats soldiers with mental health problems. Billy, who spent  years with the Paras and the SAS, said: “With over  veteran suicides since  that’s a dficult number to get your head around. “Why are they not getting help with PTSD or other mental health problems ” Billy, who has guarded A-list stars such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, has been ­decorated for bravery and had people die in his arms.He said he thought people with PTSD were weak until an SAS friend developed it. “I realised he had PTSD and it was something very real and very dangerous,” he recalled. Billy praised the Sunday People’s Save Our Soldiers campaign,which calls for an overhaul of how the MoD tackles PTSD and other mental health issues. He said there should be a ­specic centre giving veterans and ­members of the armed forces world class treatment rather than a ­“confusing” multi-agency approach.

For the first time since March, pubs and bars in England have been allowed to reopen, and punters have taken full advantage. But the scenes have sparked alarm, amid concerns that the R rate in London has risen above  again.Scientists have called on the public to stick to social distancing rules and stay two metres apart where possible, but there was little sign of that happening. One man who passed through the busy streets this afternoon told : Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish. And that was at about :pm. Not much chance to socially distance even just walking down the street. Have you been in a packed pub today  Email webnews@mirror. Scenes of drinkers packed in closely sparked a furious backlash on social media. One shocked woman wrote on Twitter : Just seen scenesSoho pubs... my heart goes out to those health care workers and their families who died of Covid to save the rest of us... disgusting lack of respect. And one man shared video of groups gathered in the streets, writing: Soho lockdown is over. Another fumed: Just seen the scenes in Soho. Itaposs asthe health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.Elsewhere in London, Borough Market was also packed, and large queues of people were snapped around London Bridge. One Twitter user fumed as pictures of the area circulated: Just as we all thought. Borough Market, London this afternoon. Idiots one and all.Earlier today the World Health Organisation said the number of daily infections is the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic. Delighted punters have voiced their joy after they were finally allowed to set foot inside their local boozers again. One man, named Jimmy, earlier said : Itaposs brilliant being back. I was on nights, finished my sht...went home had a shower and came in.Have my first Carling was like an angel p***ing on the tip of my tongue. Itaposs great that itaposs back on draught. Iaposm sick of cans in the house. Yesterday Englandaposs chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that this virus is a long way from gone. He added: It is not going to be gone for a long time. Nobody watching this believes this is a risk-free next step. We have to be absolutely serious about it.He warned that a second wave is very much a possibility as lockdown restrictions are eased. More than half of voters think the hospitality sector has been reopened too soon, according to a new poll. Some % believe outlets like pubs and restaurants are going back into business early, the Opinium survey states.

Large parts of the UK will be overcast today, and a weather warning is in place on Sunday - with a mph aposweather bombapos set to hit. The Met Office says there will be rain today across Western England and Wales, but areas in the east will avoid the worst of the rainfall. London, Birmingham and the North East are expected to stay mostly dry, which will be a relief to those taking advantage of beer gardens for the first time since March. In the South East, where it is expected to be cloudy but dry, the Met Office says. Some parts of the country will reach C as experts warn of a disappointing summer to come. The North West, expected to be cloudy all day, will see highs of C. In the North East it will be slightly warmer, but could see some rain. The Midlands will see some drizzle, but will nevertheless be humid, while the South East will see some bright spells and highs of C.  Tomorrow yellow weather warnings are in place, with gusts of up to mph in the north and mph in the south. A “mediocre” July was forecast by The Weather Outlook. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze told Blowing Hot and Cold videochat: “Bad weather as lockdown eases is ironic after a great spring with people indoors. July looks mediocre.” Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: “The Atlantic is expected to dominate until mid-month, with approaching the end of July seeing longer drier spells and transient heat before fresher Atlantic air s.  “Frost would not be a surprise in the most prone Scottish Glens early this coming week.” A Met Office forecaster said: “Cool, blustery conditions on Monday for all follow Sundayaposs wet and very windy weather clearing the North. “A North-South split is then most likely, with rain and strong winds in the North, possibly spreading to other areas, with the South drier.

The chain, which is reopening the majority of its  premises from this morning, has admitted price increases will apply to beer, spirits and wine, as well as the food on offer. Drinks will go up p, while food will increase by p, although prices will y across the UK depending on location. But itaposs not the only chain of boozers to ramp up the cost of a pint. The cost of lager and bitter in Samuel Smith pubs will be hiked by as much as £ from today. Favourites like Taddy Lager will also rise from £. to £. and a pint of Sovereign Bitter will go up in price from £. to £..to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening.  Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon told The Sun: “Prices will go up on beer, spirits and wine, by approximately p a serving and by approximately p on a meal. “All we can say in this area is that we try to keep prices as competitive as possible. From time to time there will be price rises but we always try and minimise them. “Even with price rises, the entire pub industry, including Wetherspoon, will be less profitable than before pubs closed, because costs will be so much higher.” From today, customers can expect a dferent drinking experience in Wetherspoons. Queuing outside, depending on numbers inside the pub, and using hand sanitiser on entry will become the norm. Disposable aposone-useapos menus with the new list of prices will be recycled after being given to a customer. Punters will be asked to order food and drink on the Wetherspoons app and they will not be allowed to move tables around, which have been set out by staff to observe social distancing rules. As well as these changes being made to ensure the pubs are COVID-secure, Wetherspoons has also said that it will be asking customers to provide contact details and information before they are served.  Wetherspoons punters will be asked to hand over their contact details every time they visit a pub when they reopen from Saturday. While itaposs not a legal requirement to provide this information, itaposs part of the NHSapos Test and Trace initiative which means you will be contactedsomeone during your visit has been diagnosed with COVID-. You will only be allowed to visit with one other household, and Spoons says it will be enforcing it from Saturday, alongside encouraging small groups only.  Children will still be allowed to visit family friendly pubs in the daytime, but parents must make sure that that are seated at all times. If you turn up in a large group, or you start to gather once inside the pub, staff will ask you split up. And If the pub begins to become overcrowded, you may be asked to leave.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost. Thousands of people praised the driver for her full commitment to the job, with many suggesting she had earned a raise and promotion.

We will need all possible teaching resources at our disposal over the next year to compensate for any loss of learning suffered during lockdown, as well as to bring much needed resilience to the education system at this challenging time.#We are working with local authorities to establish what additional staff are needed.

That was something a lot of us considered.“Given everything that has gone clubs will just be glad it’s happening atall.“The fact things have improved over the last few weeks is allowing us to still have this competition.“But it is still a long way to go yet before we get to August .“Hopefully things keep moving in the right direction so that we can play the tournament.”With the first three qualying rounds up to the play-offs now one legged the Reds will need the luck of the draw to land a Pittodrie tie.Home advantage in the all or nothing tie will be determined by the first team out of the hat in the draw.Aberdeen had initially been scheduled to kick off their Europa League on July  but that entry has been pushed back seven weeks due to Covid-.McInnes and his squad, along with Motherwell, will discover their first qualying round opponents at the UEFA draw on Monday August .The draw for the second round, where Premiership runners-up Rangers enter, will be made on Monday August .The Europa League second round will be played on September  with the third round on September  and play off on October .McInnes recently said he hoped there would be some financial assistance from UEFA for clubs drawn away from home in the one legged ties.Away trips will bring the expenditure of flights and hotel stays without the chance to offset that spend by home gate income.Any home games in the qualiers for Aberdeen will be played behind closed doors.Aberdeen hope to have as many as , supporters back to Pittodrie in October, after the Europa League qualiers,the Scottish Government’s easing of lockdown restrictions allow.However Scotland’s Fist Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged caution over October for the phasedof fans.McInnes said: “One legged ties is something that was mooted a few weeks ago.“Obviously the Europa League has still to be concluded from last season.“There is also the fact that games that are normally played in June and July will now be in the back end of August.“One legged ties kind of makes sense and was expected to be honest.“It will be a dferent competition in the early stages because of that.”McInnes will attempt to lead Aberdeen into the group stages of the Europa League for the first time in seven attempts next season.In the previous six years the Reds have fallen at the third qualying round five times and exited at the second qualying stage once, to English Premier League Burnley.In preparation for the new season Aberdeen signed winger Jonny Hayes on a two year contract following his exit from Celtic.A deal for Hayes, , could only be completed because the Republic of Ireland international offered to defer his wages for a year.Due to the Covid- pandemic and predicted £m losses McInnes is for now unable to bring in new signings.It could be a case of one out for one to come inthe Reds sell a player although the club are adamant there will be no fire-sale despite the losses during the coronavirus shutdown.McInnnes is confident he will have a strong squad next season.He said: “With a clean bill of health I feel we can go and compete and achieve what we want to this season.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

their credit, they did not do this.In contrast, they allowed much more parking on the opposite side of the estuary, at John Muir Country Park, which is closer to Dunbar and the East Links Family

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

It may just be the run of great weather through the spring, or the slightly slower pace meaning we can all take the time to enjoy it that bit more. Maybe it is the quieter streets helping us hear the birdsong better, but many folk canrsquot help thinking the reduced traffic and less mowing ndash just less interference all round ndash makes for a much healthier relationship between us and the wildle with which we share our towns and country.For me, the most striking thing is quite how vibrant and green everything has become in a single season without feet tramping over plants or mowers chopping through them. It is almost asnature is just waiting in the wings when we are gone the world around us will recover in the blink of an eye. Thatrsquos one of the most powerful things about the living word, and plants in particular. They donrsquot need us, but we definitely need them. Plants provide us with food, drink and medicines, they clothe us, provide building materials, shape our myths and give us the very oxygen we breathe.Modern society often fools itself into feeling removed from plants, but the vast majority of humanityrsquos cultures are profoundly shaped by the green world around us, and Scotland is no exception. Its rich heritage of plant lore shows how the countryrsquos flora has shaped our history, from the earliest inhabitants right through to the present day. Hints come from archaeological finds ndash ancient log boats hewn from huge, single trees show the importance of the coast and rivers to hunter-gatherer and early settled communities. This is understandable when much of the interior was covered in deep forest. These forests evidently harboured some huge trees,the boats are anything to go by.Millennia of exploitation, climate change and \"land management\" mean there are very few trees as large and straight as these left in Scotland, so we have to imagine these early post-Ice Age times as a primal world, where hunting and gathering were the fundamentals of le. Modern foragers find there is a huge wealth of interesting botanical fayre out there ndash a topic wersquollto later.Plant pollen found in ious Bronze-Age cups and beakers suggest a culture where honey, mead and beer were important aspects of either daily or ritual le, with many of the plant finds potential flavourings for the drinks. Interestingly, brewers and distillers have turned to many of these same species in making modern concoctions, supporting the huge growth in artisan beers and gins.Another wonderful find is the lsquohair-moss caprsquo found in the defensive ditch around the Roman fort of Newstead, near Melrose in the Borders. Woven from the tough stems of the woodland-dwelling hair-moss, Polytrichum, this enigmatic artefact prompts many questions ndash who made it  A Roman soldier, camp attendant or member of a native tribe  Why was it literally lsquoditchedrsquo  Is it a cap, or something   The now peat-blackened stems form a frill of hair around the cap, so my pet theory is that it was the forerunner of the lsquosee-you Jimmyrsquo wigs you can buy in tourist shops. Or maybe not.One of the big issues with archaeological botany is how to interpret these botanical finds. The fact that hazel shells pop up in ancient middens all the time might reflect hazelnutsrsquo popularity and value as nutritious foods or the fact they remain fresh for months. Or it might just be because the hazel shells are tough and survive through to the present while softer fruits, leaves and other parts of the hunter-gatherer diet rot away, giving us a  impression of people who appeared to eat nothing but hazels and shellfish ndash sounds quite posh actually.In more recent times, we are very fortunate that people had the foresight to research and record many fascinating uses ndash one of the champions of this was Sir Robert Sibbald. A th century physician, botanist and eventually Geographer Royal to the Scottish Crown, his passion for plants and their uses led him and friend Andrew Balfour to establish the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This year is the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary and from a small plot of land behind the Palace of Holyrood House, this institution has grown into a pioneer of international research and collaboration on plant ersity and conservation.Sibbaldrsquos pamphlet entitled Provision for the Poor in Time of Dearth and Scarcity was an attempt to list all the edible things in Scotland in case crops failed and famine reared its head again as it had in the \"Seven Ill years\" of the s. Provision for the Poor lists a great many edible plants that could be foraged, as well as many fish, fowl and other animals including wildcat and pine marten ndash essentially the bat or pangolin of their day in Europe. More than one hundred species of plants are listed in the book, although with names such as ldquothe small hemlock chervil with the rough seeds it could be a bit of a lottery trying to identy the correct plant. Chervil would be tasty, while hemlock would be deadly. This one sounds most like bur-chervil, a relatively rare plant which has been eaten in the past. Strangely, Sibbald does not mention a single mushroom, reflecting the Scottish and wider British dread of a fatal error while mushroom hunting.Sibbald does, however, reserve space for seaweeds. Coastal communities across Scotland ate plenty of this nutritious resource, and it was likely on the menu for those earliest settlers millennia before. Martin Martin, a native of Skye was commissioned by Sibbald to document the land, people and natural history of the Gaelic-speaking parts of the country through the late s. His renowned account A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland mentions many uses for seaweeds as fertilisers, snacks and medicines. Carrageen pudding was made from carrageen seaweed and is still made widely today. It needs plenty of flavouring ndash traditionally lemon, pepper or vinegar. Reminiscent of a supernaturally bland cregraveme caramel it was thought particularly good for invalids recovering from stomach problems. The jelly-like chemicals in the seaweed help to set the milk for the pudding. Called carrageenans, they can be found in a host of modern products as gelling agents.Seaweeds are fascinating group. As dferent from most land plants as we are, these marine algae are abundant and wonderfully erse. The burned ash of some of the big brown seaweeds was the basis for Scotlandrsquos kelp industry in the th and th centuries. Thousands of tonnes of mineral-rich seaweed ash were produced annually and made many of the lairds in coastal areas very wealthy men. The same could not be said of the crofting families that were set to making the pits on the beach, hauling the weed and tending the fires as they smouldered. Parts of the Orkney archipelago were likened to volcanoes because of the smoke billowing up day and night from the shores. The kelp ash was very versatile ndash as a fertiliser, for bleaching linen or use in glassmaking. Inevitably, cheaper replacements were found over time and the bottom had fallen out of the industry by the s. The lairds who had grown comfortable on the profits of the industry looked straightaway to the next big thing ndash sheep. The failure of Scotlandrsquos kelp industry went hand-in-hand with the Highland Clearances.Tracing where these ideas about plants and their uses come from, and how they change on their journey, is fascinating. Plant medicines are a great source of such stories. St Johnrsquos Wort is an excellent example ndash it appears in classical Roman literature as fuga daemonum ndash the chaser of demons. It was widely used as a medicine throughout Europe from Classical times ndash the idea possibly spreading with the Romans, although one of its names in Gaelic suggests a strong connection to the Celtic god Lug who filled a similar role to St John as a shining, heroic sort. Of course, in Gaelic Christianity, the plant became St Columbarsquos plant and was known by one curious name reported by Alexander Carmichael: \"armpit package of St Columba\". Pieces of the plant were tucked into the oxter, where the sweat and hair would presumably break up the plant and allow the active \"demon-chasing\" principle into the thin skin of the armpit. This is a beautully elegant interpretation of the plantrsquos antidepressant compounds. If you were beset by devils, an interpretation of psychiatric issues such as depression, then surely the power of a saint or a god working through the plant would vanquish those demons.We still do not understand how St Johnrsquos wort works as an antidepressant and it can have signicant, dangerous interactions with other medicines, but it is just one example of a rich folklore building up around a real-le bit of biochemistry. How  would people have interpreted this seemingly magical property of the plant  The sinister associations of foxglove with witches, the dead or fairy-folk reflect a poison still used as a medicine in heart conditions today. There are many other examples of intriguing tales where a botanical story might hold the key to a new medicine, and many where the story is seemingly just that ndash a story. Why, for example, do witches supposedly fear rowan trees  Is it the red berries or some other property lost to time ndash and has anyone actually done a proper double-blind scientic research study on it  Of course it doesnrsquot matter why, but just take a look at how many gardens have a rowan tree by the gate and you can see that these stories run deep in the cultural psyche.As well as the ideas and stories, our flora also contains many plants that were brought here by humans, either intentionally or by happy accident. These are the lsquonon-nativersquo flora and actually make up about half the species we find in Scotland today. The vast majority of these are rare, often limited to the port towns where they arrived, or the gardens they were cultivated in. A very few of them can be invasive, but they have all contributed to ersity of our new flora. In the face of climate change and globalisation, the flora changes all the time, and many species, both native and non-native are hugely adaptable. Watch this spaceas the sweet cicely brought by monastic communities from central Europe as a flavouring and strewing herb evolves into a unique new iety or species cut off from its original populations.Many traditionally useful plants are important parts of Scotlandrsquos ancient native habitats. These are precious and unique places with global signicance for bioersity. The incredibly rich Atlantic oakwoods ndash our local \"west-coast rainforest\" ndash have a profusion of lichens, mosses and ferns, but are potentially threatened by development. The pinewoods of the north west and mountains are hemmed in by vast tracts of heather moorland while the looming threat of climate change is never far from the headlines. However,you fence off the heather moorland, excluding grazing deer and sheep, the recovery is nothing short of miraculous ndash within a matter of a decade you have a beautully rich young pine woodland emerging. Once again, we see how resilient plants and habitats can be.Scottish Plant Lore, an Illustrated Flora, explores the wealth of versatile plants on a tour from the seashore up the mountains to the city streets. The beautul illustrations are the work of over  wonderfully talented artists which interpret the Scottish native flora in watercolour, acrylic, pencil or even the ink from the ink-cap mushroom tap.Dr Gregory J Kenicer is a research botanist in the education department at the Royal Botanical Garden Edinburgh.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it.

To get back and the very first thing she sees is him with Belle, she realises nothings changed.At the beginning, she is angry at Leyla for that, because she was convinced that she was coming back to her husband at least being worried about their safety.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

However, fruiting plants can require more care and attention than you might have anticipated - especiallyyoure hoping for crops all summer long.We caught up with seasoned allotmenter, garden writer and kitchen gardener Rekha Mistry, for her tips for feeding your crops, and increasing the amount of fresh veg you get to pick and eat this summer...What should budding veg growers know before they start feeding their crops \"You need to give your crops a good start by nurturing the soil in the previous season,you can. Thats the best way, so the plants have a good chance of being quite strong and healthy, so that when the feed does come, they can cope with that feed,\" explains Mistry.\"Once you plant [your plants] out, keep the beds well weeded and watered - they need to be watered, not to a point where theyre waterlogged, but keep watering so the soil is not dry. And once they get going, I tend to not water too much, let them do what they need to do and keep an eye on them.\"Do you absolutely have to feed plants \"Yes and no. A lot of people have this idea that no dig is the answer to growing without having to do anything to your plot, but it all depends on what nutrients are in the mulch youve given your plants. And normally, compost and farm manure does not have the right rich nutrients theyve got the bulk the roots can hold on to, but not the feed they need,\" says Mistry.\"[Your plants] will need some feed at some point, because once the flowers come on, they need more nutrients to grow bigger and stronger. All the energy is taken up by the fruit, the plant has got nothing left, so they do need that uptake of more nutrients and thats why they need to be fed.\"Which crops particularly need a feed \"Your tomatoes, aubergines, peppers, chillies those are your long season crops, they need the feed, because theyre growing for longer. The minute the flowers come on, the energys going there. The more you feed them, the more flowers will come through.\"Which feeds do you recommend \"I feed flowering plants seaweed and comfrey feed , and anything thats not going to flower and will give me greens, like brassicas nettle feed. I do use [shop-bought] fish, blood and bone by Maxicrop when I cant get hold of seaweed. Nettles have a lot more nitrogen [good for green growth], whereas comfrey has a lot more potash [good for fruit and flower production].\"How do you make homemade feeds \"For comfrey, in spring, when the first growth comes throughyou collect all the leaves, pack them in a bucket - preferably with a lid, because it smells like no mans business - put a brick on it to weigh it down, andyou can get rainwater, thats the best, but just normal tap water will do, fill it up and let that brew in a warm place.\"Leave it outdoors, thats fine, but in a sheltered place where it will catch the sunlight the majority part of the day, and six weeks later, empty that, dilute it one to  parts - one part comfrey tea, nine or  parts water - and feed back to your plants. Do the same with the nettles. I make comfrey feed three times in the year, and nettle feed twice a year.\"Why do you make homemade feed \"Its free and natural. No chemicals are added, so its organic too. [The plants are available] on my allotment and will only die back and get added to the compost bin, so why not make a feed before it gets onto the compost heap \"When should you start applying feed \"Plant feed only goes on when the flowers come about. Always wait for the flowers to give them the true feed that they need, at the right dilution.\"How often should you feed plants \"Its always once a week. [Crops in pots] need more moisture, but the feed is always once a week - never overdo it with the feed.\"What tricks do you have for increasing pollination  \"Comfrey again is a very good plant to have, just for the sake of getting pollinators in because it produces so many flowers. Bees are attracted to it. Borage is another one, nasturtium any wild flowers I can get hold of that will grow. So right now, Ive got a wild scabious- that will bring so many pollinators its unbelievable. Lavender is another one, Ive got a lot of lavender on the plot.\"What  can you do to increase yield \"Dont think that once youve cleared the bed, thats it. You have to keep on top of weeding, that is number one because they take up the most nutrients. If weeds have landed next to your plants, theyre going to take up more nutrients than your plant will. And so thats why, as a gardener, weeding is number one.\"Try succession sowing. A lot of first timers will do everything in spring, and then the plot gets exhausted by the time summer comes. If you sow little and often, you will get a crop all the way through the whole season,\" Mistry continues.Follow Rekha Mistry on Instagram at instagram rekha.garden.kitchen and on Facebook at facebook rekhagardenkitchen, and check out her blog at rekhagardenkitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"walk-bin-cullen-moray","story":"Grade: Short hillwalkDistance: . miles .kmTime: . hoursIF you like Cullen Skink, the curiously named soup made from smoked haddock, milk and onions, you may be interested in comments made by the infamous Dr Samuel Johnson.

Daran Little began his tale on the day of the soaprsquos debut, December , , with its creator, Tony Warren, hiding in the loo from first night terrors and Pat Phoenixhammering on the door, begging him to come out.The way ldquoRoad told it, there was as much drama off screen as on in Coronation Street, starting with the hunt for just the right cast. Warren, actor turned writer, wanted to create something with ldquodirt under its fingernails, and he demanded the actors be genuine northerners. Lovingly played by David Dawson, Warren could be particular to the point of obsession about what he wanted.If you had a penny for every scene in which he burst into managementrsquos offices shouting the odds you could have bought the Rovers and the Kabin and still had enough left over for a chippy supper on the way home. But it was this cast-iron belief in his creation that made it authentic.Asked by the casting director to sum up Elsie Tanner, Warren shot back: ldquoMid-s, battered remains of looks and figure. He eventually found his Elsie . The final piece of the casting jigsaw was Ena Sharples, played terryingly by Lynda Baron.Everywhere you looked there were strong women.

Every actor in these coronavirus-inspired remakes has had big Clarks casuals to fill, none more so than Freeman standing in for Alan Bennett. I had my doubts at first, there being a thin line between genuine Bennett and parody Bennett, but Freeman nailed it as stay-at-home Graham, put out because his mother had started seeing a gentleman caller.The scene when Graham recounted ldquomam berating him over his mucky mags took the breath away.

It may be that it has done so more effectively than the UK Government it has certainly looked more competent, and deserves to be commended for that.But until we can realistically compare international data, reliably test the rate of infection, and have information about levels of immunity , it is too early to say so definitively.There is still no cure, no vaccine, and no indication of whether a second, even worse, spike is likely. It is even theoretically possible that countries with what look like the worst results now will fare best in the long run, though to pin hopes on that would certainly have been an unreasonable basis for government responses. The trouble is that no one knows, so the precautionary principle ndash what scientists lean on when the science is uncertain ndash is the obvious approach to the medical risks.The damage wrought by coronavirus is not merely to health, however: while it is understandable, and correct, that the Government should have made that the immediate priority, it also has to consider other costs and risks.In education, employment, the economy ndash particularly tourism, hospitality, arts and retail sectors ndash welfare, taxation and other issues, excessive caution has produced devastating, measurable costs, not all economic. Some, including poverty, home care for the vulnerable and the impact on non-covid medical treatment, from transplants to chemo to mental health, threaten lives and qualities of le as seriously as the coronavirus.It was always impossible completely to eradicate risk from le , and accepting that is still true in the age of coronavirus should inform the Governments approach to emerging from lockdown. Some firms cannotat all under current restrictions the solution is to listen to business leaders and find ways of mitigating risk, with clear guidance.Some of Scotlandrsquos distinctions ndash the need for face masks in public, or easing open pubs and restaurants from Monday by beginning with outdoor spaces alone, proposals for reducing distancing , for example, screens are installed ndash look perfectly sensible and proportionate, though greater clarity in specying the rules is still needed.Others ndash a delay of a couple of days or tiny distinctions in numbers at gatherings ndash raise the suspicion that theyrsquove been created for the sake of dference. Thatrsquos perhaps unworthy , but itrsquos a complaint critics ndash not just political opponents, but those desperate to get back to work or see their families ndash are bound to make.And there are areas where such minuscule distinctions are not merely petty, but pointless and unworkable. Holyrood shouldnrsquot be bounced into decisions by Westminster, but ndash when mutual arrangements have been made among all the major European countries ndash itrsquos absurd to maintain a travel ban when air bridges are in place, especially since plenty of holidaymakers travel from and back to English ports and airports.

Scotland did not invent the modern world. At best, we were one of many small nations whose people contributed some of the ideas and ingenuity that improved our shared human experience. The Declaration of Arbroath did not inspire the fathers of American independence. Can we not just appreciate it for what it is without making extravagant claims on its behalf Perhaps Irsquom being too unkind. Unlike many successful entrepreneurs who are content to enjoy the fruits of othersrsquo endeavours without paying anything back, Sir Tom seems like a caring chap whorsquos sincere about leaving the world better than he found it. His foundation has helped many iniduals and groups to grow wings and fly. When it comes to blowing smoke up our fundaments, though, hersquod be advised to leave it to the politicians who can do it without thinking.Yet, when you eventually did drill down to the essence of his homily there were some sound conclusions, evenit was a little light on specics, a charge he levelled at Benny Higgins. Mr Higgins is the Scottish Governmentrsquos new best friend and he had also issued us with his roadmap to recovery. Mr Higgins says he is no fan of paying everyone a fair universal income. This is hardly surprising as the mere prospect of this would have caused his former employers at Tesco to reach for the Diocalm.Sir Tom rightly concluded that Scotlandrsquos small to medium enterprisesheld the key to recovery over the next five years, though he ought to press for a more nimble and adroit approach to public sector procurement. He also wrote passionately about the need to consider ideas from a wider arc of talents.ldquoDo not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand, he urged Nicola Sturgeon. ldquoLet us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this, he added.Yet, while I may be inclined to trust an entrepreneur with a veriable track record of making ladders rather than pulling them up, Irsquod demur at ceding signicant influence to the wider business community. Were it not for the sharp practices, profiteering and predatory instincts of large corporations wersquod be looking at the future with a shade more optimism.The biggest weakness in Sir Tomrsquos diagnosis and cure was the absence of anything resembling collectivism. It was all top-down when it needs to build from the shop-floor. The key to a well-managed and fair route away from the privations of coronavirus lies not in giving rich businessmen the idea that their ability to make money is the golden mean of a healthy economy.Any prescription that omits the trade union movement and the Living Wage Foundation simply wonrsquot work. The stagnation in the wages of our poorest-paid workers prevents them from supporting small businesses and building local economies. The tilt towards the tyranny of zero-hours contracts by the High Streetrsquos new cartels erodes the confidence of young people to make long-term financial and emotional commitments.Predatory behaviour such as this happens when trade unions are discouraged and the workforce is dehumanised and measured only in their profitability. No one is denying you the right to turn a reasonable profit but when you sacrice the right to dignity and respect in the workplace for it you arenrsquot running a business but a sweat-shop.The reasonable and fair deployment of capital permits all sections of society the chance to contribute. When this is distorted by greed and aice it quickly descends into unfettered capitalism. At times of mortal peril it begets disaster capitalism where billionaires feed on pestilence, war, famine and death and invest in those governments who specialise in making these happen. They have feasted on coronavirus.During these wretched months we have been at our best when those with very little have risked everything to maintain the lestyles of affluent people. The very worst of us was observed in the actions of Tim Witherspoon, Richard Branson and Willie Walsh, head of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG who, despite decades of massive profits instinctively sacriced their lowest-paid staff at the first hint of trouble.Itrsquos a template now being followed by those further down capitalismrsquos food-chain as tens of thousands of jobs disappear. Yet, no-one it seems is prepared to ask why our financial system always demands that those who are least able to cope with an economic challenge are the first to be jettisoned. Each Thursday we stood to applaud them and our NHS workers for their daily sacrice. Now that they are being fed to the wolves the applause must be ringing hollow in their ears.The myth of the lsquowealth-creatorsrsquo travels on the lie that an enlightened group of capitalist necromancers is solely responsible for their own success and that only through their natural beneficence are the rest of us blessed with a job. The truth is that the workers are the real wealth creators. If large corporations could discover a way of making profits without having to employ actual people theyrsquod escort us all from the building personally.By all means, Sir Tom ldquoengage the best brains from around the world your ldquojob-creators and entrepreneurs.

This is laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Each of the rights contained under these articles contains limitations when there is a genuine societal need to restrict expression. However, offence against religious sentiment does not feature in any of these restrictions. In fact, in , the UN Human Rights Council said \"prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system are incompatible with the Covenant\". This principle applies to all forms of expression, including statements which are critical or disrespectful of religion.Furthermore, it is generally accepted that forbidding dissenting speech against religion promotes religious intolerance rather than protecting adherents. The UNrsquos Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Dr Ahmed Shaheed, made this case strongly saying in  \"when governments restrict freedom of expression on the grounds of ldquoinsult to religion, any peaceful expression of political or religious views is subject to potential prohibition.\"Fraser Sutherland, Chief Executive, Humanist Society Scotland, Edinburgh EH.IS political correctness going to stamp out all satire at the expense of religion in Scotland  No more Billy Connollys. No more Dave Allens. No more Le of Brian. The threat is there in the Hate Crime Bill, which the SNP Government has placed before parliament.Someone isnrsquot a victim of a hate crime because their religious sentiments are hurt or offended. Many people found the jokes of Billy Connolly and Dave Allen \"offensive\", but the law did not rush in to prosecute the offending comedians. Likewise with the film Le of Brian. The right to freedom of speech was considered more important than any injured feelings caused by the satire.In England and Wales, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act  is the counterpart of the Hate Crimes Bill now at Holyrood. In that Act, there is a clear and unambiguous defence of free expression in relation to religion: ldquoNothing in this [legislation] shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a dferent religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.We need the same safeguard written into the Hate Crimes Bill. The law should concern itself with protecting people from hatred, threats and vilication, but it should not extend that into protecting ideas and beliefs. On the contrary, the law should uphold freedom of expression and the liberty to criticise and mock all sorts of ideas and beliefs. That freedom has been hard earned after centuries of censorship and repression.

Like-for-like sales for the six weeks to September ,  were up .%.\"The outspoken Wetherspoon chiefhad faced criticism for once playing down the risks of people gathering in pubs during the pandemic at the time and insisted that the government was wrong to shut them down.In March, in the aftermath of Boris Johnson announcing the coronavirus lockdown, it emerged the pub chain denied it was ldquoabandoning its , staff and insisted it could not afford to pay them during the Covid- crisis until the company was reimbursed for their wages by the government.Details of the loan which were confirmed onJune .He angered workers and MPs after sending a video message to staff a few days before the official lockdown indicating they would no longer be paid while the company works out details of a ldquofurlough scheme under which the government will pay % of wages.He hinted they could seek work in Tesco, which was hiring staff to help it meet the countryrsquos need for food delivery and distribution,they needed employment in the meantime.Mr Martin, who donated pound, to Boris Johnsons General Electon campaign said at the time: ldquoCompanies like Costa, owned by Coca-Cola, and McDonaldrsquos, being owned by large multinationals, can afford to retain staff and commit to paying them, before details of the government furlough scheme are published.ldquoHowever, they are in a minority in the pub and restaurant trade. Most companies, including Wetherspoon, do not have the resources, while pubs are shut, to make this commitment and need to see details of the scheme in order to retain and pay staff, as the government has sensibly requested, rather than instigating large-scale layoffs.ldquoThat may seem stark, but thatrsquos the economic reality of the unprecedented situation in the UK today.But in a separate statement, Wetherspoon had blamed a ldquocomplete misinterpretation of its message to staff, although it did not dispute that they would cease to be paid after Friday while details of the furlough scheme were finalised.ldquoAs we understand it, tens of thousands of hospitality workers and others have already lost their jobs, but Wetherspoon is retaining all its employees, using the government scheme for the purpose for which it is intended, said a spokesperson.ldquoWetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said to employees in a video that supermarkets were urgently looking for staff, since all trade from pubs, restaurants and cafes had transferred to supermarkets in the last few days.ldquoWetherspoon has had urgent calls from supermarkets asking for help in recruitment. Tesco alone urgently needs , staff, we understand. Tim Martin said in the video that staff who wanted to work for Tesco should do so and they will be given first priority when Wetherspoon pubs reopen.ldquoWetherspoon believes that the actions it has taken are responsible and sensible in the dficult circumstances.Mr Martin, who played a leading role in campaigning for Brexit and as the Citys most outspoken critic of the EU, had been hoping for forecast sales for the year to July  to rise to pound.billion, up from pound.billion.Mr Martins pub chain took the unusual step on May  of publishing corrections the business magazine Forbes had made to the stock exchange about its actions post-lockdown.It said that articles published online on March  and May  , made a number of what it called \"factually incorrect statements\" regarding the company.It said it was alleged that the company told the \"workforce that not only would they not be paid, but they can trot off to get a job in a supermarket\".The pub chain said: \"As regards pay, a company video, recorded on Sunday March  actually said, all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen.\"Wetherspoons published the transcript.The pub chain stated: \"An email, sent out with the video, said: All hourly paid employees will be paid as normal on Friday March  for all hours worked up to, and including, Sunday  March .\"Staff were paid on that Friday and have been paid on every Friday since.\"The statement in Forbes that staff were told they could trot off to get a job in a supermarket is misleading.\"The video actually said,  youre offered a job in a supermarket, many of you will want to do that. If you think its a good idea, do it...I promise you, well give you first preferenceyou want to come back.\"Forbes also said that the company announced that... pubs WILLopen sometime in June. That is also incorrect.\"In a stock exchange announcement on  April, Wetherspoon said, the companys current assumptions are that its pubs will remain closed until late June .\"The assumptions related to the modelling of two financial scenarios, for the benefit of investors, which necessitated an estimated opening date.\"The date was only an estimate and the company made clear that it would only open when permitted by the government.\"The video transcript published by Wetherspoons.Hi everyone, Im very sorry about the situation thats occurred with our pubs, theyve been shut, as you know, unprecedented in the last  years and it puts everyone in a terribly dficult position. I know youre all sitting there wondering what the hells happening. Over the weekend Ive had lots of phone calls with dferent people and were trying to sort it all out as best we can in this highly unusual situation.The good news is that the government has undertaken to underwrite peoples wages for an indefinite amount of time, which is great as we have no money coming in through the tills, which is not something that we ever planned for as you can appreciate. The governments promised to pay about % of wages, they will probably be pretty slow about paying it so there may be some delays, for which I also apologise, but I feel sure theyre going to come through on their promise.Our main aim and my main aim is to reopen. We employ over , people so its very important for them, just as important perhaps for the country is Wetherspoon, you, thanks to you, pays ,th of all taxes, so its very important to the country that we reopen. It might be weeks, it might be months, tremendous pressure on us all because of the uncertainty, apart from all the practical considerations, so all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen and I know that almost all of our trade now has gone to supermarkets, not only our trade but the trade from cafes, leisure centres, restaurants etc.Weve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want , people to join them, thats half the number of people who work in our pubs. If Im being honest I say you can get the furlough payments and stay at home,youre offered a job in a supermarket many of you will want to do that,you think its a good idea do it, I can completely understand it.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed. However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...The SIC will make a decision later in the year about the outcome of the public holiday that traditionally follows the Lerwick Up-Helly-A# festival.Andrew Moorhouse, who had been missing since early Thursday morning, was traced safe and well on Friday evening.

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI’ve always been of the opinion that local government should be exempt from the Machiavellian attempts of people whose only agenda is to disrupt the successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for the people of these Western Isles.I guess too naive.Cue SNP leader, Councillor Gordon Murray’s latest dog-whistle, resulting from last week’s meeting of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.For those who remain oblivious to the frequency at which Facebook Barbara Woodhouse wannabes broadcastMr Murray sometimes operates with an economy of factual accuracy which leaves those who are unprepared to dig # even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Mrs O#Neill said she would never apologise for attending the funeral of a friend.The PSNI said it is examining footage from the funeral for breaches of the regulations.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson warned that the PSNI risks harming its standing in loyalist and unionist communitiesupcoming parades are not policed in the same way.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePlea: Dolores KellyLiam McBurney FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPlea: Dolores KellyBut SDLP MLA Mrs Kelly urged people not to gather on Monday week when most parades are scheduled. The traditional parades were cancelled in April when the Covid- pandemic was at its height.But since then restrictions have been relaxed, and up to  people are now allowed to meet outdoors while social distancing.Notications from bands have flooded in to the Parades Commission this week. It comes after the Belfastrevealed the Attorney General had informed the body that it had no power to prevent parades from taking place.Mrs Kelly urged bands to heed the advice of Rev Mervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the Orange Order, who said this week: Because someone  does wrong doesn#t mean we have to follow suit.The Order has also restated its position that Twelfth parades will not take place this year. Mrs Kelly said: The Orange Order has shown leadership and I think it is to be commended for staying strong in what happened in relation to Bobby Storey#s funeral.Rev Gibson#s message has remained consistent this year in the face of a pandemic and a health crisis in which we seek to protect the NHS.I would urge bands to follow the leadership in the Order. The PSNI said it is aware of discussions taking place in relation to the Twelfth and will work with partners and stakeholders to put in place an appropriate and proportionate policing support in place for any events in line with legislation at the time.But Mr Bryson said that events this week in west Belfast have posed big questions for the police.He said that given the PSNI approach when it came to Bobby Storey#s funeral, clearly many in unionist and loyalist communities will be watching closely as to how the PSNI police small, localised band parades in our community.If, for example, we were to see heavy PSNI presence... unionist confidence in fair and balanced policing will erode even further, he claimed.Belfast Related ContentGalleryThe Twelfth bands apply to hold Twelfth marches amid fallout of Storey funeralLoyalists are demanding the right to hold Twelfth celebrations after Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill attended the funeral of Bobby Storey.Most ReadPhoto emerges of Ghislaine Maxwell ‘sitting on Buckingham Palace throne’Young Tyrone brothers go viral with hilarious video diaries of le on farm during lockdown Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Updates on July Northern Ireland Executive left in sorry state as O#Neill#s apology falls flat The NI couple who spent £k on a derelict villa in Andalucia... now you can holiday there,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Commission revealed that it received a late notication from The Glendermott Valley Flute Band. It will march in the Waterside area of the city on the Tullyally Road and Ardmore Road on July . The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Ambitious cafe plans for to boost Comber centre  ","story":"PLANS for an exciting new lsquocafe culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football

have welcomed the resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church.

While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ccfadbdbdbffcbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faabfece   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
