No mean feat considering the competition from Netflix, catch-up TV and hundreds of channels. Her stay at the Street has not been without heavy discussion, with some questioning whether her approach to darker storytelling suits the show but there can be no denying that more people are watching than ever and she leaves the show in a much stronger state than she found it.As she heads on to pastures new and takes over prime time drama Bancroft, we sat down for a good chat with Kate about her time in the show, her final storylines coming up and also allowed her the chance to set the record straight on her departure and have her final thoughts on the ‘is Corrie too dark?’ debate.I was most nervous about what we talk about when we tackle a story like this – imitative behaviour which is someone doing it because they have seen it. I took some private, personal advice on that from a couple of friends who work in mental health.I also just had to think about my own experiences with my training with Samaritans. I also strongly believe that not talking about it isn’t working so I went through a whole process and had to think “how would I feel if…?” But I think it’s more important to raise the subject and try something else.Yeah, I’m all right about that side of things – I have gone from being very thin skinned to much thicker skinned! I have been asked by a researcher before appearing on Lorraine whether there were any low points to my time on the show and I thought “actually, no – without wishing to sound too twee about it, it all helps and it all counts and I will use it all in my career at some point”. I am very well supported – so many nice people have my back.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision(Picture: ITV)It kind of almost collided by accident to be honest – all of those issues with male mental health. Sometimes as a producer you would think “hang on, we’ve got a lot of stories that cover that vibe at the moment” – but that was a really good thing. We decided to cluster them and talk about it from all different angles because it is important and the figures are staggering and they are tragic.Things do need to change. I find it interesting that they are all different men with very different issues and approaches to life. Their support networks are all very different and in some cases those support networks work brilliantly and in others, people don’t know there is a problem.This is true to life. They all felt like natural character trajectories – the characters all held up to these journeys and as a theme for the show, it worked quite well.Not particularly – I still think it should be story led. With Donna in Emmerdale for example, when I spoke to Verity, she was brought back to play this final story – it was Ross’ and Marlon’s story really. Whenever you kill a character, it has to be more about the story that is left behind. For example, a character like Katie – Sammy is a brilliant actor who had been in the show for ages and also a really good friend – what that story gave was year’s worth of story for Robert and Aaron. Sammy had made the decision to go and it’s about what powers us forward – you always have to be thinking when you have six episodes to fill, what is going to drive that narrative.I was aware of the number but if I look at each of them inidually, I can justify every single one – I don’t think any of them were wasted deaths and all of the actors rose to the challenge. I have always worked with people who were gracious and generous – they always come in and do the job, even if it is challenging. There hasn’t been the same level of mortality in Weatherfield – but the key thing is about what it gives you afterwards. We’re not trigger happy, I promise – we always consider each death carefully.Yes. I suppose a way you could look at it is I could have completely avoided it if I wanted to – plenty of producers don’t want to get involved or talk to the press and that’s completely fine that’s their wand. In a social media society we live in, people always have an opinion on everything – sometimes the things I have responded to, I have got a dry sense of humour – sometimes when people are mean about me on Twitter, I have my own methods on how I might deal with that (laughs). But that’s just because that’s just how I respond to certain opinions.What I have been grateful for from the press is being able to have the chance to explain something or put something in context. In theory, drama shouldn’t have to explain itself because people watch it and it should exist on its own merit. But sometimes it’s nice to give context and explain where we are coming from and what we hope to achieve.It has been a bit of a surprise but I am very well supported and it has taught me a lot about resilience. I feel a little bit tougher that I did two years ago and that’s okay – I also understand that it’s part of the game I’m never necessarily playing a game but I do have a job to do and have to tell stories important to me and I know that others have to create their own careers off of that too.I think there will be a lot less interest in me and that’s no bad thing. I think it’s important to remember that out of the millions of Coronation Street viewers, the overwhelming majority haven’t got a clue who I am. There is a small percentage of people who do – most people don’t care and just care about the drama in front of them.With any drama, some people will immerse themselves and want to know all the IMDB credentials and some people couldn’t care less.When Iain MacLeod is here, he will have the same kind of thing I imagine and I am sure he will handle it brilliantly and I am looking forward to just concentrating on the script and the story. But as I say, sometimes it’s a luxury to be able to speak publicly and clarify things so it’s a double edged sword and I am very comfortable with that.Yes, you have to leave stuff in the story cupboard – I did that in Emmerdale with my team. The Ashley story was started under me but don’t forget, that was pitched by Maxine Alderton, that wasn’t my idea.Robron was also something I was able to leave and that’s something which grows which is fantastic. What I like about Iain and his work and why I’ll be interested in his work at Corrie – he did things with those stories that I wouldn’t have done.The Ashley point of view episode, I could watch that as a creative piece and think “hats off, I would never have thought of that”.I think that’s why he has succeeded with those stories and why I can watch him as a creative in his own right and think – “okay, that’s exciting!” I am sure he will do the same at Corrie. For my professional sensibilities, I want to leave good stuff and be proud when I go – don’t forget, my stuff will have my name on it ’til the autumn it’s my reputation and I care very deeply about that.But I care very deeply about the show as well and I have said before, you only look after these programmes for a period of time and then you hand them on.That is very much the job – if you just want to burn through stuff just to put your name on it, you won’t make many friends.MORE: Coronation Street’s male suicide story for Aidan Connor is a brave and necessary move that will save lives(Picture: ITV)I suppose all I would say is that I am sad that they were conflated because from my point of view and my bosses’ points of view, that genuinely wasn’t the case.Anyone who thinks that I pay too much attention to controversy hasn’t been paying much attention to the way I work and what I do. It’s pretty clear that I don’t cave easily and I love my job and I have been so privileged to do it. I genuinely don’t mind the stuff that comes out around it – it’s all part of the beast that is Coronation Street.I am really excited about the next job and I know that I will look back on this period of my life and be choked by how lucky I have been to do it. I come out feeling robust and hungry for the next thing.I love that soap can do that so I absolutely would work on soap again because I love the pace and I love how people talk about it. I feel very comfortable in it, I understand it, I like the people who work in it, I like the people who write about it – I just like it. So of course.One of the things I am most proud of is when you look at our reach of 16-34 year olds a couple of weeks ago around the big Phelan stuff, it was higher than it had been since 2006. That is pre Netflix, pre tablets and all of that kind of stuff – we have all of that competition now and yet it was still higher than in 2006. That makes me think, brilliant! The future of soap is just about people rising to the challenge – you’ve got to roll with the punches.When the network says, we want six a week – I left Emmerdale when it was doing seven a week – the figures were fantastic. So you go “all right, let’s do this. We need to have an extra meeting this week, we have to make sure these stories are at the top of their game. We have to justify it.” There is a side of it which means that people in my job – I don’t want to say burn out as that sounds negative – but reach the end of the process for themselves.Maybe that happens a little sooner but I think the shows are guarding against that – when you look at what Emmerdale is doing at the moment, there’s a couple of producers running it. Jane Hudson is incredible and I have worked with both Kate and Laura and they are amazingly talented, creative women.(Picture: ITV)That’s all about ensuring there is energy and creative ideas coming through all the time. The production side will have to evolve slightly, the writers will just have to keep bringing it and I think the viewers also have to allow the changes to happen organically but equally, we need to listen to their critique. It doesn’t just Teflon off me when people say it’s not funny or warm anymore or we miss this or that – we do really think about it and we try very hard.Those critiques have helped me through my whole process here and have been very valuable to me but I do think soap has a good future because I am leaving the show with the ratings in good form and higher than when I got here and when I get frustrated about negative press, that’s what I want to say – the ratings are higher, it’s sort of end of discussion, they’re the facts!If I was leaving the show with declining ratings, I might have given a different answer but I’m not – and I have enjoyed every moment. And there’s been such a great team around me, it’s not just me.Oh I thought you meant when I “snapped” at Holly! My boyfriend was sitting at home saying “that’s not Kate snapping!” (laughs). Well, Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby are coming in for a bit of fun and part of Helen Flanagan’s exit story.We’re kind of replaying a bit of a trick we have used before because Rosie has already been on shows but it will be great comedy.Phil and Holly will play themselves – I had a couple of hopes where I thought I could get them to slightly play against type! They’re such good sports – I am very happy. That’s the benefit of being in a big production company like ITV – I know Emma Gormley who runs daytime – she’s an amazing, successful person and a good friend of mine so I was able to give her a ring and she said: “yeah, that sounds fun!”I would love that! I think he would kick ass.(Picture: ITV)We have some amazing stuff with Jim McDonald. He’s going to be coming back with a lot of resentment because of what Steve did – from his point of view, he has been rotting in prison and no one cares. We also played a story 18 months ago where it seemed like Steve might have inherited a genetic disease from his dad but no one went to see Jim to ask if he was okay. We have a great story to play with that.Things get massive for the Metcalfes – they will be big right up until Christmas. I can’t promise they will still be the Christmas story as Iain is taking over from me but they have huge material for them that will see Tim and Sally at their best.We have Lewis – king of cads! He is returning – I would have him for as long as Nigel Havers would want to stay as he works brilliantly with Sue Nicholls and I love that existing dynamic that he played both mother and daughter. It’s perfect and I love everything that they have done with Sophie Thompson as none of them have overplayed it.I was anxious about that story as it’s about a medium talking about Richard Hillman. If you are going to tell that truthfully, you have a woman whose husband was a serial killer, then you have a stranger coming in but you’re playing it for laughs – how can you expect Helen Worth to play that honestly? But the writers were brilliant and were able to unfold it so it feels very truthful in the moment and we will just spin it in a bit of a different way after that. Sophie does everything with integrity – she was perfect for it.We also have Steve and Tracy – you’ve got to love it. I see them as a bit of a fiery Jack and Vera. They fit into old school Corrie but they are not old school actors – they are fresh with it. Kate Ford benefits from a much more rounded type of storytelling. She is fantastic.  When you look back at the layers she has played alongside Deirdre, Blanche, Amy, Steve and so many other relationships, there is such depth to this character. We can still see the darker side of Tracy, she’s still a superbitch – but a much more believable one.(Picture: ITV)I always liked their reunion. I didn’t always have Steve and Tracy in my head – it came about later in the day – but I always had it in my head that Steve and Michelle couldn’t see out his indiscretion. His thing with Leanne was a story I inherited – it gave me lots of mileage. What we played was Michelle losing that child and then the truth coming out – and what happens after that? Kym and Simon work brilliantly together but I just don’t believe she would forgive him after that – the dynamic needed to break up because of that and we had to go with something else. I can’t pretend that Steve and Tracy was my game plan from the start but it has grown and I think it works.Again, I probably refer back to my earlier comment about not being afraid of controversy – it’s more important to reflect the truth. If you tie things up with a bow, there’s a danger people take away from that: “it’s all right then, we don’t need to talk about this anymore, it’s done.” But it’s not done. There are lots of things within that story that we couldn’t show on screen. If I were going to show that story in court, I’d have been fascinated to have played the truth of it – I hope he doesn’t mind me name dropping here but I am really good friends with (Judge) Robert Rinder and I talked to him about the story and he spoke to me about how he might cross-examine someone on the stand or how someone else might.Rob is a massive supporter of the storyline – he’s a great friend and sounding board. Duncan Craig from Survivors Manchester did the same when he took us through the kinds of questions someone might be faced with on the stand. It’s hard and it’s brutal and you question whether we are set up in the best place to get these convictions? If it were a 9pm drama and we saw David Platt on the stand talking about what had happened to him, a barrister might cross examine him with a huge level of detail to try and discredit him – it is really intimate and makes you think “I never thought about it that way and how it could be spun”.I think it’s important not to artificially tie things up – I believe that David’s perpetrator wouldn’t be convicted in this instance. David got rid of all of the evidence. We will have to tie the storyline off – it will find an ending which will surprise people. David will get a catharsis and some acknowledgement but he might not get that legally. In soap, a lot of the justice often comes from the community – Phil Collinson used to call it the court of Coronation Street and I completely get that.(Picture: ITV)I can say that Phelan was biblical on those sea walls – he imposes his own biblical imagery and there is definitely that in his exit. We have collided stories like we did last May with Who Pushed Ken, Bethany’s story and Nick’s exit. We’re doing that again – they’re the richest stories for me. It’s difficult in these set weeks when there’s one event and everything else feels like you are just waiting for the moment – Connor gives it his all as always it’s such a good week, I’m proud of it.That’s a great question to end on but also the hardest. In a way, it all passes in a blur – it’s so busy. Without wanting to sound twee, it’s such an incredible experience – there aren’t many people as privileged to have done what I have been doing. If you had asked me ten years ago if I’d be doing this job, I’d have laughed and hidden and not thought it were possible – I’m so lucky. I feel incredibly lucky and I look back on it with nothing but fondness – even the challenging bits.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/volcano2.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;crop=1","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts days earthquake struck sparking evacuations","story":"Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano has erupted, releasing red lava into a residential neighbourhood and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for nearby homes.Hawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.Tourist stole dolphin from a beach then walked off casuallyThe eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area’s Puna district.Earlier in the week, the crater floor of the Puu Oo vent collapsed, causing magma to push more than 10 miles downslope towards the populated south-east coastline of the island.Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said red lava emerged on Mohala Street.

The Columbine killers killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High, in Colorado in 1999\u0027Those two teenagers researched and discussed those killers and their interest in them turned to hero-worship. \u0027It was against that background that they plotted their own attack upon the school they attended.\u0027In that attack, they intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance.\u0027They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end.\u0027Mr Greaney said: \u0027They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.\u0027Police deploy two helicopters and up to 50 officers to keep...One of Britain\u0027s longest-serving prisoners who once made a...University worker nicknamed Spock who murdered his female...Share this articleThe defendants sat outside the dock, behind their lawyers, in Court 1 of Leeds Crown Court as Mr Greaney began to outline the case.  Both deny a joint charge of conspiracy to murder relating to a period between December 31 2016 and October 29 2017They have also each pleaded not guilty to a charge of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence and a charge of encouraging or assisting an offence believing it would be committed. The two defendants agreed at some stage no later than late September 2017 to commit murder at the school they attended - but their plan was foiled before being put into action, the jury was told.The older boy, who appeared to be the leader of the two plotters, condoned the Columbine High School Massacre and modelled himself on Harris, it was said in court today. Diary entries revealed he kept deeply offensive Nazi and anti-Semitic views. He met his then 14-year-old girlfriend in June 2017, the jury heard, and she soon became dependent on him and he began to control her.Then, the girl told police, \u0027the darker stuff started\u0027 and she became afraid of him.The older defendant appears to have watched a video on YouTube entitled, \u0027how to carve someone\u0027, a court heard.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":null,"title":"Starbucks new Frappuccinos alarming calorie count","story":"Starbucks new Frappuccinos have an alarming calorie countMet Gala 2018: Date, theme, hosts and moreStar Wars Day 2018: What is it, why do people say \u0027May the Fourth be with you\u0027 and how is it celebrated?Tour De Yorkshire: Race route, how to watch and moreRed Dead Redemption 2 trailer, release date and everything else you need to knowSummertime Ball 2018: Everything you need to knowRoyal Wedding: The American traditions Meghan Markle will be followingFortnite hit with child safety warning by NSPCCCarrie Bickmore launches new Beanies 4 Brain Cancer range on The Project Game of Thrones actor possibly drops season 8 spoiler on InstagramLove Island 2017 couples: Where are they now? "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/18/4BBD1CDD00000578-0-image-a-9_1525195159708.jpg","title":"Teachers year long sabbaticals away classroom 5m scheme","story":"    Damian Hinds will earmark £5million to pay for experienced teachers to take a year off school to work in industry or on academic researchTeachers will get sabbaticals as part of a raft of new measures aimed at making the profession more attractive, the Education Secretary will announce today.Damian Hinds will earmark £5million to pay for experienced teachers to take a year off school to work in industry or on academic research. The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/05B1A790000003E8-5687617-image-a-25_1525361189569.jpg","title":"Sajid Javid Afghan interpreters allowed stay UK without fees","story":"    In his first newspaper article as Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured) has announced he will guarantee Afghan interpreters who served in Helmand Province will be able to stay in the UKThe commitment and bravery shown by our local interpreters while our Armed Forces were in Afghanistan was extraordinary. As the Mail has highlighted, they worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.Put simply, we would not have been able to carry out our work there without them.It was in recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the UK that we made the offer of relocating these iniduals and their families.Around 400 people have already taken up the offer and have relocated with their families, meaning in total around 1,100 people are now living in the UK.For almost five years they have been building their lives here, contributing to local communities, and we cannot allow those who have been through so much to have their lives disrupted again. I know some have felt uncertainty about their future – an issue I\u0027ve been following for some time.As I said when I stood at the despatch box on my first day in this job, I want to ensure that we have an immigration system that is fair and humane. That\u0027s why today – as one of my first acts as Home Secretary – I am announcing that I will be bringing forward new immigration rules which will ensure that the Afghan interpreters who have been making this country their home will have a route to permanent settlement. And I am also waiving the fees so they won\u0027t have to pay a penny for it.

Everyone was given the opportunity to bring family members over with them when they came to the UK.But I know that some people still have family members in Afghanistan.

Irresistible: Every year, Keith Fielder admires this gorgeous pink and white magnolia tree in Park Road, north west London           Pictured is Christopher Marsh\u0027s magnolia tree in Puttenham, Surrey against stunning blue skies and country backdrop Many species are tender and will not survive in any but the mildest British gardens. Others require a distinctly acidic soil in order to thrive. But two species with more adaptability have come to dominate our modern gardens and streets.The first to flower is Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia from Japan. This is perhaps the easiest to grow, adapting to most soils and situations, although happiest in sunshine. The other favourite is Magnolia x soulangeana.There are many names, clones and cultivars and all tolerate a degree of pollution — which is why they became so popular for roadside suburban developments in the 1920s and 30s.

King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/10/4BD80ABD00000578-0-image-m-8_1525425832384.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/05B1A790000003E8-5687617-image-a-25_1525361189569.jpg","title":"Sajid Javid Afghan interpreters allowed stay UK without fees","story":"    In his first newspaper article as Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured) has announced he will guarantee Afghan interpreters who served in Helmand Province will be able to stay in the UKThe commitment and bravery shown by our local interpreters while our Armed Forces were in Afghanistan was extraordinary. As the Mail has highlighted, they worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.Put simply, we would not have been able to carry out our work there without them.It was in recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the UK that we made the offer of relocating these iniduals and their families.Around 400 people have already taken up the offer and have relocated with their families, meaning in total around 1,100 people are now living in the UK.For almost five years they have been building their lives here, contributing to local communities, and we cannot allow those who have been through so much to have their lives disrupted again. I know some have felt uncertainty about their future – an issue I\u0027ve been following for some time.As I said when I stood at the despatch box on my first day in this job, I want to ensure that we have an immigration system that is fair and humane. That\u0027s why today – as one of my first acts as Home Secretary – I am announcing that I will be bringing forward new immigration rules which will ensure that the Afghan interpreters who have been making this country their home will have a route to permanent settlement. And I am also waiving the fees so they won\u0027t have to pay a penny for it.

Irresistible: Every year, Keith Fielder admires this gorgeous pink and white magnolia tree in Park Road, north west London           Pictured is Christopher Marsh\u0027s magnolia tree in Puttenham, Surrey against stunning blue skies and country backdrop Many species are tender and will not survive in any but the mildest British gardens. Others require a distinctly acidic soil in order to thrive. But two species with more adaptability have come to dominate our modern gardens and streets.The first to flower is Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia from Japan. This is perhaps the easiest to grow, adapting to most soils and situations, although happiest in sunshine. The other favourite is Magnolia x soulangeana.There are many names, clones and cultivars and all tolerate a degree of pollution — which is why they became so popular for roadside suburban developments in the 1920s and 30s.          Mail readers Jeremy and Ann Pemberton entered this picture of a bright pink magnolia tree in Richmond upon Thames           Brightening up the garden: Richard Blackburn\u0027s entry is pictured next to his house on a quiet suburban street In my garden, I grow M. x soulangeana \u0027Black Tulip\u0027 and although it\u0027s very hardy, most years the flowers get hit by late frost — although this late spring I am keeping my fingers crossed.But whatever magnolia you grow, each and every one is blessed with glorious flowers.Always position new plants in a sunny, protected site and keep them well watered. Pruning is largely unnecessary save to remove any damaged shoots or branches. With time and care, you never know, you, too, could one day have a magnificent magnolia like this in your garden.

All the carers, all the district nurses, have just been absolutely fantastic. But no more fantastic than you guys. You\u0027re all gorgeous.  \u0027My brother-in-law Tom said in the end maybe she was too tough for her own good, which I thought was a lovely way of putting it.\u0027 Sports reporter Vassos Alexander stepped in to host Evans\u0027 breakfast show on Thursday, reading a statement to explain the presenter\u0027s absence.  Reading the note from the DJ to his millions of listeners, Alexander said: \u0027Chris isn\u0027t here. He has been here in fact. But he had to go just before we came on air.\u0027And he\u0027s left a little note for me to read out to you. Bear with me, this is a little bit difficult for me because we are talking about one of my best friends here.\u0027He continued: \u0027Good morning, says Chris. The reason I\u0027m not with you today is because just before I came on air my mum passed away and I needed to go straight back home to be with my family. But it\u0027s all OK, in fact it\u0027s very OK, mum needed to be at peace. Moreover, she deserved to be at peace.\u0027We\u0027ve been ready for this for some time now and, as she has throughout her life, in death she has brought us together.\u0027She was an incredible woman. Anyone who\u0027s ever met her will tell you that and ultimately there was no battle lost, only a life won. Every single day.

In January last year, he revealed on Twitter she had tried pizza for the first time at the age of 91.He captioned the picture: \u0027My mum – 91 years young – first ever slice of pizza! She\u0027s broadening her horizons. \u0027It\u0027s time\u0027, she says.\u0027Evans also revealed last year he had sought his mother\u0027s advice when it was disclosed he was the BBC\u0027s highest-paid presenter.He said she had told him to \u0027earn what you can, when you can, while you can\u0027 doing a job he loved.

Reuters reports:The two sides, though, committed to resolving their trade disputes through dialogue, state-run Xinhua reported.And the U.S. negotiators agreed to bring up with U.S. President Donald Trump the question of a ban on U.S. companies selling goods and software to Chinese telecommunication equipment maker ZTE Corp after representations from the Chinese side, the report said. ZTE faced the seven-year ban after the U.S. said it failed to keep to an agreement it made after breaching U.S. sanctions.The talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices.The U.S. team has already left Beijing and is heading back to the U.S., a U.S. official told Reuters early on Friday evening. The Americans have yet to give their account of the talks.The trade discussions had been “candid, efficient and constructive,” Xinhua said, but gave almost no details on what the officials had agreed.The officials exchanged opinions on resolving tariffs and non-tariffs measures, on expanding two-way investment and the protection of intellectual property, and on expanding U.S. exports to China and bilateral services trade, Xinhua reported. It gave no indication of what actions might be taken based on those exchanges.“My impression was that (the talks) didn’t go well given the rhetoric,” said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital markets in Hong Kong. “I think the ide is still very big.”Back with the trade talks, and Reuters is reporting some Chinese proposals to the US:The latest business surveys from the eurozone suggest the weaker growth achieved in the first quarter of 2018 could be spilling over to the second.The headline index on the IHS Markit services sector PMI fell to an eight-month low of 54.7 in April, from 54.9 in March.It nudged the composite index, which combines manufacturing and services, down to 55.1 last month, from 55.2 in March.However, the figures still indicated fairly robust growth across the single currency bloc, with any number above 5o signalling expansion.Ireland was the top performer in April on the composite measure:Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, provides some context: The final PMI numbers confirm the marked, broad-based fading of the eurozone’s growth spurt so far this year. The headline index has fallen from an 11-and-a-half year peak in January to a 15-month low in April. Despite the drop, the PMI is not yet at a worryingly low level, but the survey details hint at further easing in the coming months. Here is our full story on the job losses planned at BT:Reports are coming from China of a leaked list of demandswishes from the US trade delegation in Beijing.On the list is the request that China cuts its trade surplus to $200bn by 2020, from more than $300bn in 2017.The Wall Street Journal’s Lingling Wei has details from the list:New car sales in the month of April from 2002-2018:The rise in new car sales in April should be treated with caution, says Ian Gilmartin, head of retail at Barclays corporate banking:The uptick in new car sales will be welcome news for many sellers, but we can’t have it both ways – just as we partly attributed last month’s poor result to an unfair comparison to an unusually strong March 2017 ahead of the tax changes, similarly April 2017 was relatively weaker after the VED increase came into force, which flatters today’s numbers. With the exception of last year, it is still the weakest April since 2013 but after a full year of declines, the industry will cheer a sales increase in whatever way it’s achieved.Sales of new cars rose in April for the first time in a year, but the sharp decline in diesel sales continued.However, the trade body cautioned that last month’s figures were flattered by a particularly week April last year, after buyers had brought forward purchases to avoid the new vehicle excise duty (VED) rules coming into force in the same month. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT commented on the latest figures:It’s important not to look at one month in isolation and, given the major disruption to last April’s market caused by sweeping VED changes, this increase is not unexpected. While the continuing growth in demand for plug-in and hybrid cars is positive news, the market share of these vehicles remains low and will do little to offset damaging declines elsewhere. Consumers need certainty about future policies towards different fuel types, including diesel, and a compelling package of incentives to deliver long-term confidence in the newest technologies.”Bad news for BT workers this morning as the British telecoms giant prepares to announce more than 6,000 job cuts next week, according to the Financial Times.BT is expected to announce the cuts alongside its full-year results next week, when chief executive Gavin Patterson will update investors on strategy.Shares have nearly halved over the past two years, and Patterson will be hoping that a major new programme of jobcost cuts will go some way to appease shareholders.The latest job cuts will be in addition to the 4,000 redundancies announced a year ago, the FT reports.With the exception of the CAC in France, major markets across Europe are higher this morning.While investors are likely to welcome Steven Mnuchin’s upbeat tone over in Beijing, expectations of a major breakthrough today remain low.Lukman Otunuga, analyst at currency trading firm FXTM, explains: The chances of a breakthrough trade deal from the two-day meeting are seen as highly unlikely. However, the talks could be a positive step for the two nations to avoid a potential trade war.

They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonIn 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonSomething strange happened in the US state of Tennessee in 1943. Thousands of young workers poured into a 59,000-acre site about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Vast quantities of materials followed, never to re-emerge. Houses and other facilities were built with record speed. Yet officially Oak Ridge did not exist during the war and could not be found on any map.What was going on there? Very few people knew at the time, even among the residents. The answer was that this was the starting block in a race against Adolf Hitler to build the atom bomb. Oak Ridge was one of three “secret cities” of the Manhattan Project, along with Los Alamos in New Mexico and HanfordRichland in Washington state.More than 125,000 scientists, technicians and support staff occupied the three cities by the end of the war. There is a photo of a Santa Claus being frisked at the gates of Oak Ridge and a local newsletter stamped “restricted”. Anyone aged 12 or over had to wear an ID badge. The use of words such as “atomic” or “uranium” was taboo lest it tip off the enemy.Yet some social aspects were all too familiar: even these planned communities, which tried to offer residents an idyllic lifestyle and would influence postwar urban construction and design in America, replicated the racial segregation of the era.“At first glance they seem like very normal American communities,” says Martin Moeller, senior curator of the Secret Cities: The Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project exhibition, which opens on Thursday at the National Building Museum in Washington. “But then before long you start to see things that are strange in a variety of ways, sometimes humorous.”He offers examples: “Driving by the main hotel in Oak Ridge and seeing that the bar and lounge there is called the reactor room. Starting to see these nuclear symbols on seemingly random buildings around the place but also coming to understand that these were not just typical communities that grew up in a haphazard fashion, that there was a hand of design there even at the beginning of their existence.”It was late 1942, less than a year after the US had entered the second world war, when the US Army Corps of Engineers quietly began acquiring vast tracts of land in remote areas of three states. The few residents of these areas were summarily evicted and their houses demolished.Soon thousands of young workers arrived from far and wide, initially occupying tents and other makeshift shelters within the newly designated military reservations. Shielded from public view by natural barriers and security fences, the workers quickly erected hundreds of buildings, ranging from prefabricated houses to industrial structures of unprecedented scale.The goal was singular. Aware that the Nazis were pursuing nuclear weapons – though they were not as far along as thought at the time – the US would invest unfathomable money and manpower to get there first. The cause could scarcely have been more urgent.“Despite that, in building these communities, it was considered important to create housing in environments that were comfortable for the people who would be working for the scientists and engineers who would be doing this important work,” explains Moeller, who first visited Oak Ridge three decades ago when his future father-in-law was a nuclear physicist with the national laboratory there.“There was agreement that they needed to feel at home. They needed to have a community that felt ‘normal’. And so during this time of national emergency, the US government built single family houses in what we would now consider typical suburban neighborhoods, instead of just jamming all of these people into dormitories and barracks as I would think almost any other country in the world would have done for time. That to me, in of itself, is extraordinary.”He adds: “These cities really were proving grounds for emerging ideas about town planning architecture and construction. In many cases they were continuing movements that were already in existence.”Built from scratch in half a year to produce fuel for atomic bombs, Oak Ridge was initially conceived as a town for 13,000 people but grew to 75,000 by the end of the war, the biggest of the secret cities. The housing was designed by Skidmore, Owings \u0026amp Merrill (SOM), now one of the biggest and most influential architecture firms in the world. And yet while Oak Ridge seemed to exist in a bubble, it was also very much of its time.Moeller continues: “Although these cities were very much conceived as forward-looking communities – they really wanted places that were idyllic in many ways, great places to raise families – nonetheless segregation was designed in from the start. It was just considered to be a given by all parties concerned. There were racial issues that were baked into these communities.”SOM’s initial plan called for a “negro village” at the eastern end of town, furthest from the work sites, which was to include housing similar to that provided for white residents. But as Oak Ridge grew quicker than expected, those plans were abandoned and most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures barely superior to tents.They were frigid in the winter – heated with crude stoves – and sweltering in the summer and offered little privacy. They lacked internal plumbing so residents had to use collective toilet facilities. Even married couples were not allowed to live together in the hutment camps. And residents were routinely subjected to more surveillance from the security authorities than those living in the more permanent neighbourhoods.By the end of the war, most of the white families had been moved out of the hutments and, as the population was then shrinking, went into more permanent housing. But many of the African American families continued to live in the basic dwellings until the early 1950s. There would be a twist, however. Moeller says: “In the postwar period, Oak Ridge, having now been settled as a place full of academics and very well-educated people otherwise, was one of the leaders in the desegregation movement in the south. In fact, two of the first public schools in the south to be desegregated were in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge even threatened to secede from Tennessee in order to desegregate. So there was a relatively quick turnaround.”When the US dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, killing tens of thousands of people to force an end to the war, the city’s secret was out. Many residents celebrated. One local newspaper declared: “Atomic super-bomb, made at Oak Ridge, strikes Japan.” Another said: “Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese ... Workers thrill as atomic bomb secret breaks press and radio stories describe ‘fantastically powerful’ weapon expected to save many lives.”All three cities remained part of the military industrial complex, continuing to work on nuclear weapons during the cold war as well as broader scientific research today Oak Ridge is heavily involved in renewable energy. The unique subcultures that grew during their early years of isolation also survive. Moeller observes: “These people really in many ways had to commit to create their own culture and interestingly, even to this day, some of the little theatre companies and musical troupes that were formed during world war two still exist and still operate as community cultural organisations in theses cities.”That includes “atomic culture”, or, to put it another way, gallows humour. At one of the most popular lunch spots in Oak Ridge, there are pictures of mushroom clouds on the wall. The logo of Richland high school contains a mushroom cloud. “There are pictures of atomic symbols and so on and I hasten to point out that that’s not because the residents of these communities are callous.“They realise the seriousness of the work that was done in those places during the war and afterwards during the cold war. But it’s kind of like doctors’ humour in emergency rooms. They’re somewhat notorious for being irreverent in their humor about medical conditions. It’s how they deal with the seriousness of what they do.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a9f0c34a41fb8ddb8b40057ab68bcb4687edf0/0_91_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b33638381ee5ec41ccc4970759f8b8","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4813d7aa3bf50800a796ed01e08dc595bd406708/0_88_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a1601f242c61dc267fcee0ff29d20a7","title":"brexit britain political pendulum local elections","story":"The normal rules of governments being given bloody noses at local elections have been suspended• Key conclusions from a hazy night in English local electionsThe pendulum is stuck. The traditional laws of political gravity predict a swing away from the party of national government in local elections, but it has been a while since British politics followed the obvious arc of precedent.If last night’s council election results conform to any pattern, it is the laudable habit that voters have acquired of giving party leaders cause to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on. There is no big national winner. Since the Tories were braced for a mauling and escaped without one, Theresa May will be feeling relatively relaxed today. Labour needed to demonstrate that last year’s general election gains were a staging post on the road to national power that destiny was calling Jeremy Corbyn. Destiny didn’t hang up the phone, but it has put the opposition on hold. Labour had ambitious targets – Tory bastions in London such as Westminster and Wandsworth – that did not fall.Outside the capital, Swindon and Nuneaton are the sort of places that would be swept up in Corbyn’s electoral slipstream if he were surging irresistibly towards Downing Street. But they resisted.Labour still gained a bunch of seats. The defence of the opposition’s performance is that expectations of a Corbynite carnival in Tory heartlands had run out of control, partly because of the exuberance of the party’s activists and partly because many Westminster observers were over-correcting for their failure to anticipate the Conservatives’ dismal showing last June.Not all of yesterday’s votes have been counted yet, but a provisional projection suggests that equivalent results, extrapolated as general election performances, would produce a House of Commons much like the current one. Parliament would still be hung. The biggest winners would be the Liberal Democrats, who would gain enough seats to make it back into the double-digit league.That gives Vince Cable’s party their first taste of good news since they won the Richmond Park byelection in 2016. That was celebrated as “remainers’ revenge” against the Tories in an affluent, metropolitan suburb. The Tories took the seat back within a year. Now Richmond council has turned decisively Lib Dem. Brexit is certain to be a factor there, as it is in the wider national picture. At the very least, the fact of Britain loitering in the EU departure lounge has an obvious causal relationship with the collapse of Ukip, whose number one grievance has been bitten off and digested into the political mainstream. The party didn’t even field candidates in many seats it won the last time these councils were in play. The Tories appear to have benefited most from those vacancies.Council ballots are often expressions of hyper-local issues, but the national context can’t be ignored. The government is attempting to pull off a vast, complex manoeuvre to reorient the entire country. Yet it still isn’t clear on what axis we are turning. The referendum battle was a messy combination of economic argument and culture war, neither of which has yet been settled. That is hardly surprising since Britain is still in an awkward limbo between the decision to leave (easily said) and safe exit (not so easily done). There is consensus between the two main English parties that Brexit is something that must be done, yet no agreement anywhere in the land on what that practically requires.It isn’t even possible to get a cabinet subcommittee to agree on a choice between two fractionally dissimilar variants of an alternative to the customs union. And that is just one part of the enormous apparatus of EU membership yet to be dismantled (and, in all likelihood, reassembled to roughly the same specifications). None of the big questions raised by Brexit – about the UK’s role in the world, its economic security, whether or not it is in cultural retreat from tolerance to outsiders – has an answer.The contours of those debates don’t map neatly on to the borough boundaries over which Labour and Tory troops did battle in rigid tribal formation. So even if Brexit wasn’t uppermost in many voters’ minds, it sat like a blustery, unsettled weather front over the whole political field, its unpredictable currents blowing gusts in multiple directions, helping some candidates and hindering others, but with no simple tailwind behind the biggest opposition party. The conditions were not conducive to easy swings of a pendulum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a025d01e06f183662bc3b629a34e684d0025d37/0_8_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e94cf4218000adde678ba09e26dee5","title":"labour conservatives local election results","story":"The 2018 local elections should be seen as a deflating but necessary learning experience for the Labour party, and a bullet dodged by the Conservatives. Labour has some genuinely impressive sets of results – Trafford stands out, as does Southport (part of Sefton), where Labour carried off several seats in previously barren territory Plymouth was more nip-and-tuck, but Labour is back in power.However, most of the targets were missed – the hard ones in London and some arithmetically easier ones outside – and there was embarrassing slippage in the Midlands in particular: the loss of Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth will sting. The Conservatives can point to an achievement that is the mirror image of Labour’s salvage operation in the 2017 general election – retaining more than they can have expected to in places where their vote is trending downwards, such as wealthy inner London, while making headway in the places where they can expect to gain.The Conservatives failed to bring over all that much of the leave-voting, Ukip-curious section of Labour’s core vote in 2017, thanks to a campaign that reminded much of that core vote why it does not love the Tories, and Labour’s own astute manifesto and campaign in the general election.However, the local elections did produce some exceptionally strong Conservative performances in just these sorts of areas. Sunderland set the scene early on, with a seven-point swing to the Conservatives. It may be that the Conservatives in their post-Brexit garb will automatically benefit from any discussion of immigration, even if it is prompted by a scandal of their own making, but this cannot be the whole story.Before election day, it looked plausible for Labour to win control in North East Lincolnshire, the council that covers Grimsby and Cleethorpes. Ukip had done very well here in 2014, winning several normally safe Labour wards, but Labour fought back and won them by large margins in the May 2016 local elections and presumably in the general election in 2017. Some of the Ukip councillors had defected to the Conservatives and seemed unlikely to win – but they did.It is not just in Grimsby that the political map has been redrawn. In my home town of Southampton, where I have followed elections since the 1980s, the results were unprecedented. There was no net change, but out of 16 seats three went in each direction between Labour and the Conservatives. The Tories won white working-class estate seats, knocking out the Labour council leader in the process, while Labour picked off the suburbs near the university and Southampton’s inner middle-class residential area. The 2018 results almost inverted the colours of the city’s wards in an “even year” in the 1980s.Part of the explanation for the oddness of the local election results, and the contrast to what happened less than a year ago – from Wandsworth to Grimsby – must lie in the difference between the sort of people who turn out to vote in local and general elections. Local election turnout runs at about half the rate of a general election, and that voting pool exaggerates the usual skew that one finds in turnout – local voters are even older and less transient on average than general election voters.In an environment where age and cosmopolitanism seem to define political allegiances, the party that has the support of the young and footloose is at a disadvantage in low-turnout elections, as the Democrats have found in repeated mid-terms. This should not encourage Labour to think that all will be well in a general election – one has to do a lot of work to level up the turnout, and Labour failed even with its mass membership and a government that looked on the ropes. An ominous cloud on the horizon is the voter ID trial that was tested in several (not very challenging) local authorities this year, which will entirely predictably make this problem worse in future.The other problem for Labour in these elections was one that was frequently forgotten – that most recent polling has shown the Conservatives a bit ahead (perhaps five points) and Labour at best pulling level while doing worse on questions like leadership and economic management. Back in 2014 when most of these council seats were last fought, Labour was a point or two ahead.It is not surprising that the pendulum swung a little towards the Conservatives in 2018, and more dramatically in places where their support could be expected to increase. What was more surprising is Labour’s failure to benefit from much of an upward current in London. The task was hard, as Labour had done well in the capital in 2014, but the 22-point lead in the general election encouraged confidence that proved cruelly misplaced. Expectations were allowed to run too high in public.The results in Wandsworth, for instance, were good but not quite good enough. Around the outer edges of London things were worse for Labour, not just in Barnet with its particular sensitivity to the antisemitism controversy but also in Hillingdon, where the Conservatives made net gains. The one borough in which the Conservatives were massacred in a revenge of the metropolitan remain voter was Richmond, where the beneficiaries were the Liberal Democrats who won at least a seat in every Richmond ward but one. The landslide swept in four Greens, beneficiaries of an unusual “progressive alliance” electoral pact, but left Labour in the cold.The local government scene in England was never going to be transformed in these elections – there was not much swing territory being contested, and the movement in national opinion was too small to do much. Even if Labour had done as well as it might have in London, there was also little extra that was feasible to win there. But the psychological impact for Labour, 11 months on from June 2017, to have dreamed and been disappointed, could be destabilising.For the Conservatives, there must be a feeling that they have got away with it, and normal service is being resumed after the unexpected reverse in the general election. They would be unwise to take too much comfort from this, because these are volatile times. The results of the May 2016 local elections, the other side of the EU referendum, already look – literally – antediluvian, and those of May 2017 when the Conservatives polled so well were themselves overwritten a month later. With so many potentially realigning moments ahead in the next few months, the tectonic plates could easily shift again.• Lewis Baston is a writer on politics, elections, history and corruption, and director of research at the Electoral Reform Society"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92aa15feb7a8626e72c0b2207f0de8a50b74ea2/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e1663421b3ba7accda31ea6989bfb4","title":"quakers dropping god","story":"I am not a Quaker or religious, but I have been to Quaker meetings, usually marriages or funerals, and found them deeply moving. The absence of ritual, the emphasis on silence and thought and the witness of “friends” seemed starkly modernist. Meeting houses can be beautiful spaces. The loveliest I know dates from 1700 and is lost in deep woods near Meifod, Powys. It is a place of the purest serenity, miles from any road and with only birdsong to blend with inner reflection.What these words mean is now the subject of intense debate. What are these spirits in which these people profess to believe, and how might they be appeased? It is clear that most people no longer see them as residing in a church. Yet many still turn to churches in emergencies or times of trouble, when the world seems otherwise inexplicable. This was noted after the high-profile deaths of Princess Diana and Jade Goody. As the sociologist Grace Davie put it in her book Religion in Britain, the church is a sort of public utility, a fire station or pop-up A\u0026ampE unit.To Davie, many of these people are declaring a “vicarious religion”, or what she calls “believing not belonging”. They do not like a church’s faux collegiality, the hand-shaking, happy-clapping and sense of entrapment. They do not really seek God, rather a mental and physical space to sort out their thoughts, somewhere to find “anonymity, the option to come and go without explanation or greeting … to move from one stage of commitment to another”.This is taken to explain the continuing success of cathedrals, where attendances have risen while those in churches has fallen. It seems cathedrals meet a quasi-secular searching for solitude and inner peace, stimulated by great architecture and music. Above all, they offer anonymity. A character in last week’s The Archers sought solace in fictional “Felpersham” cathedral, to find “somewhere she could be anonymous”. A latest British Journal of General Practice survey suggests doctors are increasingly being used as “new clergy” by people who are not ill but seeking something to “give meaning and purpose to life”. It would take a brave GP to prescribe a dose of matins once a day. But something “spiritual” is needed.The boom in psychotherapy is no secret. As religion declines, so emerges a craving for therapy. The 12-step movement of alcoholics and narcotics “anonymous” has much in common with Quakerism, notably the emphasis on non-authoritarian fellowship. Beyond lie the wilder shores of mindfulness, meditation, happiness courses and “holistic spirituality”. All this suggests that the purely physical aspects of our being do not always meet the needs of a fully rounded person.The Quakers have always been remarkable. They were a disruptive force in 17th-century religion. They thrived through being persecuted for denying allegiance to the Church of England. Their exclusion bred Britain’s first industrialists, bankers and confectioners, not to mention the famous Quaker Oats. Quakerism has declined of late, perhaps because there is no fortune in rebelling against any church. You can find “friends” on the web and introspection on the NHS.If Quakers now find God “uncomfortable” I can hear cries from pulpits that discomfort is the point of Christianity. Comfort is in the afterlife, and marketing it has been the church’s unique selling proposition since Luther and papal indulgences. To Luther it was a con. What is not a con is humanity’s quest for comfort in the here and now, for therapy in the widest sense of the word.The sublimity of Dolobran meeting house and the exhilaration of Ely cathedral offer more than an emotional A\u0026ampE unit. They offer places so uplifting that anyone can find it in themselves to sit, think, clear their heads and order their thoughts. There is no need for gods or religion to rest and be refreshed.To that, Quakerism has added the experience of standing up and expressing doubts, fears and joys amid a company of “friends”, who respond only with their private silence. The therapy is that of shared experience. Clear God from the room, and the Quakers are indeed on to something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae820e7b1a2d2260831b1a9b67a171f3167b24d7/0_0_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04f0dd5ed9601975beb00073c88489b","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From Tully to The Philosophy Chamber, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysIf you’re considering having children, you really should stay away from this, for the survival of the species.

Troxy, E1, Friday 11 MaySince their 2009, self-titled debut EP, Danish noise merchants Iceage have mellowed slightly, switching the post-punk clank of 2011’s critically lauded full debut New Brigade for piano balladeering, country-folk musings and, on recent Sky Ferreira collaboration, Pain Killer, a twisted take on – new genre alert! – woozy jazz-rock. Warning: these shows will involve moshing, so be prepared to be sweated on. The Scala, N1, Tuesday 8 MayFormer Brooklyn buskers Moon Hooch, three mavericks who fuse horns-and-drums jazz with thunderous acoustic techno, play the Love Supreme jazz and soul festival’s first London detour on their short UK trip. The trio infectiously encapsulate the main event’s five-year-old reputation for eclecticism, openness and improv-fuelled surprises. Roundhouse, NW1, Saturday 5 Thekla, Bristol, Sunday 6 MayString quartets and symphonies form the spine of David Matthews’s work. His 14th quartet appeared last year, and now his symphonies have reached the magic number of nine. Based on a carol Matthews composed in 2015, the five-movement work gets its first performance from Kenneth Woods and the English Symphony Orchestra. The premiere is framed by Elgar: Donald Fraser’s very effective orchestral arrangement of the Piano Quintet and the Cello Concerto, with the brilliant Sheku Kanneh-Mason as the soloist. St George’s, Bristol, Wednesday 9 MayA week-long programme this year for this always eclectic new-music showcase. The BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Alexandre Bloch kick things off with a programme including works by featured composers Qigang Chen and Bent Sørensen (BBC Hoddinott Hall, Cardiff, Thu). Cellist Alice Neary’s recital (Ewenny Priory, nr Bridgend, Fri) includes more Sørensen, alongside Peter Reynolds, David Lang and Steve Reich. Various venues, Thursday 10 to 16 MayThe premiere of George Benjamin’s latest opera promises to be the operatic highlight of the year in London. With Martin Crimp as his librettist, Benjamin has chosen a medieval starting point. Loosely based upon Edward II, Lessons in Love and Violence tells the story of a king torn between his duty as monarch, his love for his wife and family, and his passion for a young man. Stéphane Degout is the king, with Barbara Hannigan as his wife. Royal Opera House, WC2, Thursday 10 to 26 MayPhotography has a unique ability to capture visible facts but it can also be abstract and ethereal. Man Ray was the pioneer in this, experimenting with techniques that changed the objective image into a subjective one. He features in this historical show along with the likes of Maya Rochat. Tate Modern, SE1, to 14 OctoberThis exhibition brings together the art, stuffed animals, shells, Native American artefacts and other objects once gathered in a room at Harvard University. Early museums of this kind were ways of defining the world, and this 18th-century “philosophy chamber” is food for thought about the impulse to collect and classify. Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow, to 15 JulyThe British Museum is pushing Greek holidays hard. If you haven’t already been enthused by its show about Rodin and the Parthenon sculptures, this exhibition updates the story. The beauty of Greece after the second world war delighted three creative friends: Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghika, John Craxton and Patrick Leigh Fermor. Hadjikyriakos-Ghika’s travel posters will have you dreaming of summer. British Museum, WC1, to 15 JulyThere are superb images of nature here, not painted but embroidered or printed on to clothes. The representation of flowers, birds and animals in European fashion surely started as an emulation of the decoration pioneered in Islamic textiles. With the development of natural science, fashion looked ever more precisely at natural forms today, ecological protest prefers slogans to arabesques. Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, SW7, to 27 January 2019It’s your last chance to see and hear this cabinet of aural curiosities. Items on display include the first jazz record and a disc produced by Shakespeare and Co of James Joyce reading from Ulysses (pictured). Sound booths let you listen in on the voice of Florence Nightingale, Brendan Behan singing The Auld Triangle and John Peel introducing a radio performance by Pink Floyd. All that and the Doctor Who theme, too. The British Library, NW1, to 13 MayJoel Drake Johnson explores contemporary US racism in this smart Chicago hospital comedy. A smarmy white surgeon wants rid of black secretary Jaclyn – a terrific comi-tragic performance from Tanya Moodie – and enlists the help of her mousey co-worker Ileen, played beautifully by Elizabeth Berrington. Racism rears its ugly head, and in many forms. Trafalgar Studios, SW1, to 12 May Inspired by his own family history, Danny Braverman’s story of the marriage between East End shoemaker Ab Solomons and his wife Celie is a real gem. Spanning 1926 to 1982, this is a tender, funny and affecting portrait of a marriage through the good times and the bad. It is one of the highlights of this year’s Brighton festival, which runs from Sat to 27 May. Brighthelm Centre, Brighton, Tuesday 8 \u0026amp Wednesday 9 MayThere are two versions of IOU’s show, written and performed by poets Jemima Foxtrot or Cecilia Knapp, but both take the audience on a voyage in a specially fashioned bus through the streets of Brighton. Essentially, this is a journey into the past, relayed using headphones. Through the story of one woman, it makes you consider the person you were and the person you have become – and what the two might say to each other if they could only meet. The Barge, Brighton, Saturday 6 to Tuesday 8 MayGeorge Costigan makes his mark as the flailing, angry patriarch James Tyrone in Dominic Hill’s emotionally devastating revival of Eugene O’Neill’s autobiographical drama. A family have incarcerated themselves in unhappiness and the words, insults and whiskey bottles pile up in a long and gruelling evening – but it is one that, for all the misery of the Tyrone family, brings its own rewards. Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, Saturday 5 HOME, Manchester, Thursday to 26 MaySuccessful shows that are drawing to a close often sell out, so with just two weeks now until it disappears, this is the moment to catch Jez Butterworth’s beautifully detailed drama. The deserved winner of best play at this year’s Olivier awards, it is a beguiling, sometimes violent, look at how family secrets and national politics can affect inidual lives. Every single character, however small or insignificant, seems vividly alive in an exquisitely wrought tale. Gielgud Theatre, W1, to 19 MayFollowing her bold settings of Kate Tempest poems, Cunningham turns to another powerful female voice for her latest work. In a dance adaptation of Sarah Kane’s Crave, Cunningham works four dancers and four actors to address challengingly taboo themes of rape, incest, murder and madness. Barbican Centre: The Pit, Thursday 10 to 13 MayThe excellent hip-hop festival celebrates its 15th anniversary with one of its classiest ever lineups, including rhe Olivier-winning Boy Blue Entertainment joining the Locksmiths (pictured, left), French freestyler Mufasa and hip-hop supremo Jonzi D, premiering a new work set to a jazz score by Jason Yarde. Sadler’s Wells, EC1, Saturday 5 to Monday 7 MayKey to the dance programme of this year’s Brighton festival is Charlotte Vincent’s film adaptation of Shut Down, a meditation on masculinity that combines revealing documentary testimonials, street dance and rap. Onca Gallery, Brighton, Wednesday 9 to 27 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

It is indicative of Karl Lagerfeld’s world view that the setting for his latest Chanel catwalk show was, in fact, plan B.“We wanted to set sail, to take you on an actual cruise,” shrugged Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion, before the show on Thursday night. “We worked on a plan for two years, but to find the perfect boat proved impossible.”The replica boat, named La Pausa after Chanel’s villa in the Cote d’Azur, took a month to install inside the Grand Palais, detailed down to the sound of creaking ropes and distant seagulls, and was the backdrop for clothes that revived the Chanel of a Breton stripe-wearing Coco on holiday. Cream ribbed sweaters had anchor-stamped gold buttons and wide white trousers were worn with deck-friendly flat shoes. Evening dresses were bugle beaded, while the house tweed suit turned up with a skater-shaped skirt and cropped jacket. City black was swapped for sea blues and candy stripes. The mood was Coco at Deauville, with a dash of Duran Duran’s Rio. After a show featuring 80 outfits, all 900 guests were invited onto the upper and observation decks for champagne, Negroni cocktails, seafood and truffle chips. The French venue and mood – previous Chanel cruise collection shows have taken place in Dubai and Havana – reflected a new closeness between the French fashion industry and government. Emmanuel Macron’s drive to promote Paris as an international capital of savoir-faire and dynamic business recently saw French designers honoured at a gala dinner at the Élysée Palace, while Melania Trump’s haute couture Chanel gown at last month’s state dinner was interpreted as one of the signs the French president’s trip to Washington had been a success for France.“Macron is engaged, he understands what luxury is about, he understands savoir-faire and a creative business model. Of course that makes a difference to us,” said Pavlovsky. “But we were investing in Paris before Macron was here,” he added, referring to Chanel’s trusteeship of specialised fashion ateliers and sponsorship of the Grand Palais, for which the brand is bankrolling a $40m (£30m) renovation.Chanel is also taking a socially responsible stance. To counter criticism of the wastefulness of extravagant sets being accessible only to an elite audience, Chanel will invite schoolchildren and the families of employees to events on La Pausa. “And after that, the whole set will be recycled, upcycled or repurposed,” said Pavlovsky. “Nothing will be thrown away.”The Francophile mood is the most striking trend to emerge from the season of cruise shows, which Chanel kicked off in Paris. Christian Dior, which staged last year’s event in California, will show its collection in the grand stables of the Château de Chantilly, 30 miles from Paris. Louis Vuitton will swap last year’s Japanese location for the French riviera, while even Gucci – a storied Italian brand, but owned by the Paris-based Kering – moves from Florence to Arles. Aside from Prada, showing in New York in this weekend’s run-up to the Met Gala, and MaxMara, who will stay in their hometown of Reggio Emilia, the centre of gravity during fashion’s increasingly important cruise season is very much in France.The cruise shows, which  the month of May, see the most powerful names in the fashion industry go head to head. Only the industry’s highest rollers, who can afford the eye-popping expense of staging a show spectacular enough to draw the world’s attention in one 20-minute slot, can afford to compete in this unofficial Champions League of fashion. The egg-box structure on a man-made island in Dubai which Chanel built as a catwalk for a pearl-themed collection in 2015, a nod to the emirate’s 1,000-year pearl ing industry, was said to have cost $1.7m. The pay-off is that “at fashion week, you have 20 minutes for us and then it’s on to the next show. At cruise it is just about Chanel,” said Pavlovsky.Coco Chanel pioneered cruise as a fashion concept. Collections go on sale in November, originally aimed at affluent women packing for a Caribbean winter cruise who did not wish to be seen again in dresses they had worn that summer but could find nothing appropriate in stores full of winter clothes. Wearable rather than trend-driven, colourful and upbeat, designed with comfort and flexibility in mind, cruise has outgrown its ocean-liner origins to find a modern market among women looking for wearable but Instagram-friendly pieces for the festive party season. “Of the eight collections in a year, in terms of sales, cruise will be at number one or two,” said Pavlovsky.The Wertheimer brothers who own the controlling interest in Chanel have never disclosed revenues, which are estimated to be around $6bn each year, but the brand still has no plans to sell clothes online. “We do a lot, digitally. We are number one on Instagram, for instance,” said Pavlovsky. “But I believe if we sell our customer a jacket for £7,000, we have a responsibility to make sure that it fits her properly.”Karl Lagerfeld took his bow accompanied by his longtime studio director Virginie Viard, once again fuelling speculation of a handover. Chanel insist that any discussion of a successor to Lagerfeld, who has a lifetime contract at Chanel, is disrespectful to the 84-year-old designer who has led the house for 35 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c452feca4f7059ad0640f78792939c540fc61a6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b35fa6803da76496c7d51a0c00604c14","title":"the best wide leg trousers for all ages in pictures","story":"A hint of shaping – whether it’s with a silk shirt or a jumper loosely tucked in at the front – will stop trousers looking too voluminous"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ae2cc8bbe6d9f0ca02fb88ad47f49e18aef27a7/0_6_4282_2570/master/4282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9d6d1ed301d441981f22281d9683b31","title":"arsene wenger sad cruel arsenal atletico europa league defeat","story":"Arsène Wenger laid bare the frustration after watching his Arsenal team come up short in the Europa League semi‑final against Atlético Madrid to miss out on the dream farewell to his job of 22 years.Diego Costa – so often the scourge of Arsenal from his Chelsea days – scored the only goal of the second leg at the Estadio politano for a 2-1 Atlético triumph and they will face Marseille in the final in Lyon on 16\u0026nbspMay.Arsenal struggled to create clear chances against a supremely organised Atlético defence that has now kept 12 consecutive clean sheets at home and, amid the disappointment, Wenger also had to reflect upon the final avenue to Champions League qualification being shut down.It\u0026nbspwas Wenger’s 250th European game but there will not be another one for him at Arsenal. His final match before he leaves the club at the end of the season will be on Sunday week at Huddersfield Town’s John Smith’s Stadium. The manager is still to win a European trophy. “I am like the team – very sad and very disappointed,” Wenger said.“I am even very frustrated, as well, because when you go out of a competition and you had the performances over the 180 minutes that we had, it is very difficult to take. For the club, there is now some time to think about what to do for next season.“I think there are some good ingredients in our team and they will bounce back. These players have quality and, with the right additions in the summer, the team will compete next year.“I have no plans at the moment. I have to recover first from a huge disappointment. I’m very, very sad to leave the club with that exit. I will take some time to recover from this. The game can be very cruel sometimes it is very nice. But the suffering is very strong tonight.”Arsenal’s task was made more difficult by the loss of the captain, Laurent Koscielny, in the early running to a ruptured achilles tendon. Koscielny has had problems with the achilles for some time. “It doesn’t look very good,” Wenger said. “You can always hope for a miracle on the scan but the first signs don’t look very good.”Wenger’s regrets took in the first leg, when Arsenal dominated against an Atlético team that played with 10 men for 80 minutes. But they could score only once and they conceded a late goal to Antoine Griezmann.“The tie should be over in the first game,” Wenger said. “We were 1-0 up at home and we conceded a stupid goal. Then, tonight, we conceded on the counter with one minute to go before half-time. Those are vital moments in a game of this stature.“Atlético played with a bit of fear in the first half but at 1-0 they had a bit of a cushion. Costa’s goal was vital. That’s why he is one of the best strikers in the world. We missed something in the final third. In the first half tonight, we had plenty of opportunities but we missed something always in the final ball. Even in the second-half, too.”Wenger marvelled at Atlético’s defensive resilience, which was led by Diego Godín, but he complained about some cynical fouls from them. Gabi and Saúl Ñíguez were booked for stopping counter-attacks. “Gabi is happy to stay on the pitch,” Wenger said. “It took the referee a while to book Gabi. Those situations could have been very dangerous for us. But they are a clever side who defend very well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9a801377fb82ef4b97539ffebdbe8308db42c8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317f7cd6582f5d11f687f79f0b303046","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Arsène Wenger bids the Emirates goodbye, Chelsea hope for a Liverpool hangover and the relegation battle heats upResults elsewhere could secure Brighton’s Premier League status this weekend, but Chris Hughton’s side have been granted an early opportunity to get the job done themselves at the Amex on Friday night. Brighton have beaten United just once in their history and have already lost to them twice this season – both times at Old Trafford – in the Premier League and FA Cup. United’s unconvincing Cup quarter-final win came immediately after their feeble Champions League surrender against Sevilla, in a match Alexis Sánchez and Paul Pogba sat out as unused substitutes after failing to impress against the Spanish side. Both players have since hit their stride and are likely to feature on Friday, a state of affairs that suggests if Brighton are to beat United for the first time in nine attempts since 1982 they will have to do so the hard way. With Davy Pröpper back from a spell on the naughty step, Hughton must decide whether to pair him with Dale Stephens in his first choice central midfield partnership, or stick with Beram Kayal, who has impressed in the Dutchman’s absence. BGAnd so it’s farewell. This will be the last time most Arsenal fans see Arsène Wenger at the Emirates, at least until they unveil his statue. Thursday’s failure in Madrid denied the venerable Frenchman if not a fairytale farewell, then at least a glorious appendix. Such will be the emotion of the occasion that the match is almost secondary, and yet defeat would be an almost cruel humiliation, leaving Wenger’s side distant from the top five and level on points with Burnley themselves. Having failed to unlock one famously well-organised defence in the Europa League they immediately face another one – Burnley have conceded 16 fewer goals in the Premier League than Arsenal. “There’s a lot of noise around the game but we’ve got to go there and do a job,” says Nick Pope. “We’re not just going to turn up and make up the numbers, we’ve got to put our foot down and put our own stamp on the game.” Having conceded decisive, controversial stoppage-time goals in each of their last three meetings, some luck for Burnley against Arsenal is long overdue. SBThe fact that Swansea’s final two games of the season are against two of the three teams below them in the table means victory for Stoke against Crystal Palace in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off will send West Brom down. With qualification for next season’s Champions League not yet assured, Tottenham will be rooting for Stoke in the hope that an inevitable sense of deflation at the Hawthorns will put an end to West Brom’s impressive rally under Darren Moore. Spurs were fortunate to draw the corresponding fixture at Wembley, when Salomón Rondón squandered a glorious opportunity in added time. With Mauricio Pochettino’s future the subject of some speculation, failure to beat the Premier League’s worst team for a second time could be a precursor to grave repercussions come season’s end. BGIf ever there is a good time to face Liverpool’s deadly front three then it’s this weekend. The exertions of their Champions League semi-final epic against Roma are sure to have an effect on Jürgen Klopp’s side but with a top four spot not yet assured, Liverpool cannot afford to take it easy. Chelsea have won their last three matches in the Premier League to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe’s top competition next season, with Olivier Giroud’s form the catalyst for their revival. The France striker has a solid record against Liverpool, with five goals in his 10 Premier League appearances against them for Arsenal, and his new employers know only victory will do on Sunday. EASo far at home in the league this season, Manchester City fans have celebrated 58 goals and 15 victories. This weekend they will be celebrating again whatever happens in the game, with the trophy to be presented to after the final whistle. This will be their third Premier League title, but the first won with sufficient comfort to plan the presentation. Victory on Sunday would take them to 96 points, a tally never previously reached in the Premier League – for some time, the record books have been their only significant opponents. Huddersfield, though, were troublesome in the reverse fixture in November, when City came from behind to win thanks to Raheem Sterling’s late goal, and given their position in the table could hardly be better motivated to poop the party. A reminder of how fast situations in football can change: Huddersfield have scored 27 goals in the league this season the last team to score fewer than 30 top-flight goals and avoid relegation were Manchester City, in 2006-07. SBOne point and a place above the relegation zone, Swansea City will drop into the bottom three if they fail to beat Bournemouth and Southampton win at Everton. While nerve-wracking, this scenario would not necessarily constitute disaster – with home matches against Southampton and Stoke to come, Swansea’s destiny remains in their own hands. Nevertheless, they could do with getting back into the winning habit, but Carlos Carvalhal’s inclination towards caution on the road could hamstring their chances of a first victory since the beginning of March. While it would be harsh to be critical of Swansea for their hiding against Manchester City, but their supine performance at the Hawthorns spoke volumes. Despite playing the worst team in the ision, Swansea could scarcely have been set up more cautiously and were lucky to secure a point. At Bournemouth they will be better served by starting with similar urgency to that with which they ended last weekend’s defeat to Chelsea. If they are to go down, why not do so swinging haymakers? BGPaul Lambert’s jack-in-the-box antics on the touchline have been a highlight of this season’s relegation battle and with his Stoke side fighting for survival at home against Crystal Palace on Saturday, expect the 1997 Champions League winner with Borussia Dortmund to be on top form. Lambert can take heart from Stoke’s victory over Palace last season – the first time they have beaten them in seven attempts – as they start the game three points from safety. Roy Hodgson’s side gained revenge in November and, with 38 points already in the bag, look to be safe after successive home wins. Yet Palace fans of a certain vintage will be wary of celebrating too soon – in 1992-93, the Premier League’s inaugural season, the Eagles were relegated with 49 points from their 42 games. EAEverton have lost only one of their last seven games, and that was against Manchester City. There was a time this season when they were genuinely concerned about the relegation scrap at the end of the season and so it has proved – in a manner of speaking. They are comfortably in the top half of the table, but having beaten Huddersfield last week to leave the Terriers in peril, they now face Southampton, with West Ham still to come. This is the third time that Everton have played Southampton in their final home game of the season, and the second time they have done so with one more away league match to follow. The last time it happened, in 1986, Everton were destined to finish second to Liverpool in both league and FA Cup, and the Saints were given a 6-1 thrashing. Two days later Southampton travelled to Tottenham and lost 5-3. Peter Shilton’s injury meant 17-year-old Keith Granger was flung into the side after conceding 11 in those two games, he never played for the club again. SBGiven their previous in the field of downing tools for managers , it will be intriguing to see how Leicester’s players approach this game. Claude Puel’s future looks uncertain in the wake of his team’s slaughter at Crystal Palace and with nothing much to play for, the reaction – or lack thereof – of his players will be telling. Still in danger of going down, West Ham will be hoping there is mutiny in the air over the King Power Stadium and look likely to bring Andy Carroll along. The striker apologised to David Moyes following an act of petulance and subsequent training ground row, prompted by his manager’s refusal to give him a run-out against Manchester City from the bench. Should both sets of players fail to up their game after respective embarrassments, fans can look forward to witnessing one of the most lethargic “contests” in top-flight history. BGSince winning four successive matches to secure top-flight status, Newcastle have looked distinctly mediocre in losing to Everton and West Brom. Here though, they meet a side whose motivation is similarly suspect, though it is hard to know if this match will be entertainingly carefree or demoralisingly careless. This is familiar territory for Watford: since promotion in 2015 they are yet to win a fixture in May. They have not won since the first weekend of March, their dismal away form has prompted their gentle slide down the table. Having lost 2-0 at Spurs on Monday, they declared themselves encouraged. “We managed to create chances and if we keep doing it we will begin to get results,” said Étienne Capoue. “If we play like that we will get the points against Newcastle.” With only a visit to Old Trafford to come, if Watford are to reach 40 points they surely have to.

This should help brokers and also create other opportunities for new online tools, it said.The FCA also proposed making it easier for people to compare mortgage brokers, saying it intended to work with the broker sector to develop ways to compare deals.The report said: “We found that on average a consumer’s choice of intermediary makes a difference to the eventual cost of their mortgage. In particular, we have observed links between more expensive mortgages and intermediaries that typically place business with fewer lenders. But there are few tools to help consumers choose an intermediary.”Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition, said: “For many the market is working well with high levels of consumer engagement. However, we believe that things could work better with more innovative tools to help consumers.“There are also a number of longstanding borrowers that have kept up to date with their mortgage repayments but are unable to get a new mortgage deal we want to explore ways that we, and the industry, can help them.”The FCA also outlined how “mortgage prisoners” could be better helped, many of whom took out interest-only deals before the financial crisis. Stricter lending practices since the crisis have made it harder for these customers to find a cheaper mortgage.The regulator suggested there could be an industry-wide agreement for lenders to approve applications for a new mortgage deal from existing customers whose most recent mortgage was taken out before the financial crisis and who are up to date with their payments.The FCA will consult on the findings and proposed remedies, with a final report due around the end of the year.

The party gained control of Plymouth, winning four seats in the town where the member of parliament is a Conservative, Johnny Mercer, showing Labour can do well outside the capital. Denying the Tories overall control in Trafford (by gaining four council seats) was exactly as party sources were predicting.

Instead, the north London council moved into overall Conservative control, amid Labour recriminations about antisemitism.By early morning Labour had gained seats but failed to make the advances it had hoped for in London. The Conservatives lost seats but were relieved to cling on to key councils. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had a “reasonable night, a good night”. Jeremy Corbyn celebrated seizing Plymouth council and said he was delighted by the result. One pollster estimated that a general election matching these results would see Labour with a similar number of seats to the 262 it scored in 2017, while the Tories would lose 12.Surprise success for two Green candidates against Conservative incumbents helped Labour become the biggest party in the Manchester council, one of its biggest successes of the night. I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations.The party celebrated as it took control of Richmond by gaining 22 seats and had some other good results. Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, said: It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.” But elsewhere Vince Cable’s party showed no signs of enjoying the sort of recovery that would see it turn into a strong force at Westminster.Ukip\u0027s vote collapsed and by Friday morning it held just two seats, 44 down on four years ago. General secretary Paul Oakley tried to put a brave face on things by comparing the party to the Black Death. It\u0027s not all over at all, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that\u0027s exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn\u0027t finished because Brexit is being betrayed. Dan Sabbagh and Andrew SparrowIn the most cheering news for Jeremy Corbyn, Labour became the biggest party in Trafford – formerly the Conservatives’ only council in Greater Manchester – and gained control of Plymouth, also from the Tories.Corbyn arrived in Plymouth on Friday morning to celebrate the result, saying the polls showed his party was “ready for a general election whenever it comes”.But Labour fell short in areas of London where success had been anticipated, notably Barnet, but also the traditional Tory strongholds of Wandsworth, Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea. Away from the two main parties, the Liberal Democrats had success in London boroughs that heavily back remain in the EU referendum, while the Greens gained councillors. As predicted, Ukip was all but wiped out in seats defended by the beleaguered party.Another council where a major Labour campaign effort failed to pay off was Swindon, a bellwether area. The party gained one ward from the Lib Dems but none from the Tories, who hung on to control of the Wiltshire council by one seat. Labour also lost control of Derby, Nuneaton and Bedworth.Barry Rawlings, the Labour group leader in Barnet, which has a sizeable Jewish population, acknowledged that antisemitism had been an issue. “I must say that in some wards where there is a large Jewish community, it has made a difference,” he said.One defeated Labour councillor, Adam Langleben, said the party lost in Barnet because of “the inability to deal with this issue and to tackle antisemitism”.He added: “Every Jewish Labour household we visited, people said, ‘Not this time.’ Activists were being told, ‘This is a racist party, an antisemitic party.’ Doors were slammed in their faces. We as Jewish Labour activists were told we were endorsing antisemitism.”Overall, in the first major test of voter opinion since last year’s general election, the main parties remained deadlocked – a result more likely to buoy Theresa May, who at one point had faced predictions of a leadership challenge if Thursday’s polls had gone badly for her.Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had enjoyed the better results. “It’s been a good night for us and it’s been a dreadful night for Labour,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They were promising to sweep the board in London, and they haven’t gained, at the moment, a single council in London.”Speaking In Plymouth, Corbyn said it had been a good night: “Obviously, I am disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground, but if you look at the overall picture, Labour gained a lot of seats across the whole country. We gained a lot of votes in places we never had those votes before.” However, some Labour MPs were more wary. Lisa Nandy tweeted that results in her Wigan constituency and places like Dudley, where the Conservatives gained seats, “suggest Labour needs a renewed focus on towns if we want to win a general election”.Andrew Gywnne, Labour’s election coordinator, retrospectively sought to play down the party’s chances in London, saying it had been “incredibly optimistic” to believe it could take some councils.He told Today: “Let’s remember, we’ve never even controlled Westminster. We last controlled Wandsworth in 1978. We made progress in those areas,. Let’s be plain – we picked up seats.”The Lib Dems recorded the biggest gains in initial seat numbers, gaining control of Richmond in south-west London and retaining power in Cheltenham, Sutton and Eastleigh – albeit from a low base when the seats were last fought in 2014.Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, told Today: “It’s a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We’ve been winning seats off Labour in the north in leave-voting areas. We’ve been winning in the south off Tories in remain areas. It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.”The Greens took six early seats, including two in Trafford from Conservatives. The co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, told the BBC: “If you’d told me four years ago this is where we’d be, I’d have been be thrilled.”Ukip, whose vote has collapsed since the EU referendum, lost 86 seats in early results, holding only two.Its former deputy chair Suzanne Evans conceded that the party could be in terminal decline. “If Ukip does crumble I think you could still arguably make the case that it’s been one of the most successful political parties in history.” In Labour’s most notable early success, it won four seats from the Tories in Trafford, taking its total to 30. After the surprise double-win by the Greens in the Altrincham ward, the Conservatives were left with 29 seats, down from 33.“I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group. “This is far beyond our expectations. We hoped to tip the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus.”But Labour’s attempt to take control of Wandsworth was foiled after the Conservatives successfully concentrated resources in key strongholds amid a significantly increased turnout. Labour gained seven seats on council that has been known for its low council tax and outsourcing of local services. Labour also failed to force the Tories out of power in Swindon despite a well-resourced campaign and a string of visits from Corbyn and other senior figures.The Labour group leader, Jim Grant, said he was disappointed. “We need to sit down and analyse the figures. Turnout was up all round. We got as many votes as we thought we would need to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885875f3668c0a788247a1a583c43296abc256d7/0_137_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a81ae07a72c023c6877c4e4b687524e","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Labour challenge falters in Wandsworth, Swindon and Kensington and Chelsea, but wins Plymouth and takes Trafford out of Conservative controlLabour’s failure to take Barnet council from the Conservatives is directly related to the antisemitism scandal that has plagued the national party, say local activists and councillors.The north-west London council was Labour’s prime target in the capital. The party hoped to seize control from the Conservative-led administration whose focus on outsourcing earned them the nickname “Easycouncil”.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said Barnet was a Conservative “crown jewel” Labour could win, but overnight the Tories took back the council from no overall control.Barry Rawlings, Barnet’s Labour leader, laid the blame directly on the party’s antisemitism crisis, which has led to Jewish leaders and members of the community protesting against Jeremy Corbyn in Westminster:I want to speak directly to our Jewish brothers and sisters. I am extremely grateful to members of the Jewish community who cast votes for Labour. But too many didn’t.It wasn’t because they disagreed with our manifesto, but because they felt the Labour party has failed to deal with antisemitism on a national level. They are right.The prime minister has visited Wandsworth in south London to congratulate Conservatives on seeing off a challenge from Labour to hold on to control despite losing six seats.Theresa May said: “Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed.“The people of Wandsworth re-elected a Conservative council, and that’s for a simple reason. You charge the second lowest council tax in the country, you provide excellent local services like the weekly bin collection.“That’s the message of these elections across the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.”To cheers from activists waving Conservative banners, May added: “We’ve seen other success in London. We’ve held Hillingdon, Barnet, Westminster.“And outside of London, we’ve made progress in places like Dudley and Walsall. We’ve taken control in Basildon and Peterborough. And that’s all the result of the really hard work of our councillors, our activists, our supporters and our revitalised campaign machine.“But we won’t take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.”Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC: “We have consolidated the base we made after the General Election. If you looked at the national polls, it showed the parties were neck-and-neck and we have done rather better than that in some areas.”Mr Watson said Labour now has more councillors in London than at any time since the 1970s.“You can always do better, but we think we have consolidated our base and we are quietly satisfied with the result,” he said.The Conservatives became the biggest political party in the Black Country town of Walsall today, and are expected to form a minority administration.The Tories ended up with 30 seats, while Labour lost two to be left with 26, with the remaining four seats split between the Liberal Democrats and independents.They also made gains from UKIP, who lost all three of their councillors in Walsall.Previously Labour was in control with 28 seats to the Tories’ 24.Walsall Conservative leader Mike Bird is confident of getting the support he requires to run a minority administration. Labour was expected to hang on to power, with some activists claiming they would take an overall majority.It follows the Conservatives’ Eddie Hughes unexpected victory in the general election last year in Walsall North.Labour has called on the Government to scrap voter ID as a matter of urgency after a trial saw people in England turned away from polling booths for not carrying the necessary documents.Cat Smith MP, shadow minister for voter engagement and youth, said:There was absolutely no case for introducing voter ID in the first place but after yesterday’s fiasco, it is impossible for the Government to justify rolling it out.After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the Government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote.We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the Government to scrap their voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.Ken Livingstone has been on Sky News talking about the local election results and the impact of allegations of antisemitism on the Labour party, from which he is currently suspended.Livingstone, who has been accused of antisemitism himself, denied previously labelling Adolf Hitler as a Zionist. He said:If you go on Jerusalem’s Holocaust memorial website, one of the documents you can download is about the deal that the Zionists did with Hitler did with the Zionists in the thirties.Hitler wanted to get all the Jews out of journey, and the Zionists wanted to move them all and create a Jewish state in Palestine. They collaborated, they didn’t like each other but they collaborated together to do that.”The former Labour MP and London mayor accepted that claims that he was antisemitic had hit the result in Barnet, where the Tories gained control:If anybody believes I said Hitler was a Zionist then yes, that is damaging. What’s been so bad is that two years on this smear about me is still there unchallenged.”Sky News presenter Adam Boulton suggested that “the best advice might be not to bring Hitler into contemporary politics”.“I only do it when I ask a question like you’ve just done,” Livingstone said. “I’ve never written a speech or article about Hitler.“It always gets you into trouble if you tell the truth,” he added.Asked if he should just retire, Livingstone said: “I’m not going to my grave without this issue being resolved.”Livingstone said the antisemitism row was a “distraction” from discussing Labour policies and also blamed moderate Labour MPs for attacking the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. He said: “If we hadn’t had two years of Labour MPs undermining Jeremy, if they’d been out there campaigning, we only needed to take another seven seats and Jeremy would be leading a minority government … his policies connects with people.”He added: “Part of the problem is for the last month everything in the media about the Labour party has been about antisemitism. Any serious debate about our policies just hasn’t happened.”Livingstone said he was optimistic that he will not be expelled from the party. The leader of the Barnet Labour Group, Barry Rawlings, has issued a statement, in which he addresses the group’s “Jewish brothers and sisters”. He said Labour has failed to deal with “anti-semitism”. He said:I want to thank all Labour members in Barnet for their support and hard work, not just over the past few weeks, but over the past four years, and our wonderful candidates who could not have done anything more.We campaigned hard, we gave the Conservatives a tough time over their failure to run a fair, effective Council for the people of Barnet, and we have built, and will continue to build, good relationships with all of Barnet’s communities.That wasn’t enough this time. I am confident we can bounce back from this but to do so we will need to work harder still.I want to speak directly to our Jewish brothers and sisters.I am extremely grateful to all members of the Jewish community who cast votes for Labour yesterday.But too many didn’t. It wasn’t because they disagreed with our manifesto, but because they felt the Labour Party has failed to deal with anti-Semitism at a national level. They are right.I pledge that Barnet Labour will be a beacon to the rest of the Labour Party in tackling and defeating this anti-Semitism virus that has infected our party. For me dealing with anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of hate is not an electoral issue, win or lose, it’s a moral responsibility that defines who we are as a Party.I am so proud of the work we have done both within and across communities, faiths, backgrounds.We either fix this or our values of equality, social justice and human rights die.I pledge that Barnet Labour will be at the forefront of this collective effort by the Party we all love and wish to see succeed.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, has issued a statement on the local election results.Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections. We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.In these elections we have won seats across England in places we have never held before. We won Plymouth from the Tories, who lost control of Trafford, their flagship northern council. And Labour has won even more council seats than at our high watermark of 2014.Last year Labour showed the difference we can make in a full national campaign. This year our members and supporters campaigned in impressive numbers. And their energy, talent and enthusiasm will continue to take Labour’s message of real change to communities across the whole country.In a sign of how worried they are about Labour’s advance, the Tories talked up our chances to unrealistic levels, especially in London. The results show they’re right to be worried - we came within a whisker of winning Wandsworth for the first time in over 40 years.The Labour Party is now well placed to fight and win the next General Election – and form a government that will work for the many, not the few.Labour MP Lisa Nandy says last night’s performance for Labour, losing ground in Wigan, Bolton and Dudley, underlines the fact that Labour’s message is failing to appeal to voters in Britain’s towns.While Labour comfortably held her own local council of Wigan last night, the Conservatives got more votes there than at any time since 1979.“For a lot of people who choose to forgo the fast pace and ersity and access to culture of cities, the reason they do that is because they value the sense of community you feel very strongly in places like mine,” she says.She says politicians, including Labour, have failed to address the decline in local jobs and opportunities that has eroded this sense of community.“Towns like mine have really found themselves at the sharp end over the last 30 years. Demographic changes mean we have an ageing population - young people who used to go away to study and come back, have found there’s nothing to come back to. Wages are low, which accounts for the decline of high streets and pubs.”“People have looked to politics for some time to solve this and seen us obsessed with a city-centric model which is reliant on the benefits trickling down.” She warns: “Unless Labour gets to grips with that, the next election is far from secure, with Labour piling up the votes in cities, and the Tories having a near-monopoly on the countryside”.“It’s about jobs, jobs, jobs jobs,” she says. “Politicians need to catch up. Whoever gets this towns argument will win the next general election and the one after that.”Theresa May has tweeted congratulations to a couple of councils, which saw holds and gains for her Conservative party in the local elections.State of parties after 98 of 150 councils:Ratepayers and Residents: 37 seats (-4)Ukip general secretary Paul Oakley has insisted it was not “all over” for the party and has defended his party by comparing it favourably to the Black Death. He said the plague had caused a lot of disruption in the Middle Ages before going “dormant”.“It’s not all over at all,” Oakley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that’s exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn’t finished because Brexit is being betrayed.”Challenged over whether he wanted to compare his party to a plague that killed millions of people, Oakley said: “Absolutely. What’s wrong with that?”He pointed to positive outcomes from the Black Death: “It also led to economic growth and the Renaissance. It got rid of the whole issue of servitude, basically, and allowed people to go into the towns and escape their landlords and create their own businesses.”Anti-racism group, Hope Not Hate, has hailed the demise of “far right and radical right” political parties in the local elections. Hope Not Hate said it had been a “disastrous” night for Ukip, which it accused of plying anti-Muslim rhetoric under its leader Gerard Batten.Far-right parties – such as the British National Party and Anne Marie Waters’ For Britain Movement – also failed across the board, the group said.Nick Lowles, chief executive of HOPE not hate, said: “We should take a moment to enjoy the decline of extremist parties. It’s down to the hard work of thousands of anti-racist campaigners up and down the country, as well as incompetence and defections on the part of Ukip and the far right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd0dec418a064a6eddb938df2627d59b0564476/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec1a968883e1de9501bcaf012d5b3f5","title":"local council election results 2018 in full","story":"Seats on 150 councils are up for grabs in this year’s local elections, the first major test of public opinion since last year\u0027s snap general election.

The InSight spacecraft aims to listen for quakes and unravel the mystery of how rocky planets such as Earth form. If all goes as planned it should land on Mars on 26 November.Since the Earth and Mars were probably formed by similar processes 4.5bn years ago, the US space agency hopes the lander – officially known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) – will shed light on what made them so different.“How we get from a ball of featureless rock into a planet that may or may not support life is a key question in planetary science,” said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We’d like to be able to understand what happened.”On Earth these processes had been obscured over billions of years by earthquakes and the movement of molten rock in the mantle, he said.But Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun, and Earth’s smaller and less geologically active neighbour – may yield more clues.InSight aims to rest in an isolated spot and detect “Mars-quakes,” which Nasa described as “like a flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet’s interior”.The lander will gather information using three instruments, including a seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, made by the French space agency. Banerdt called the seismometer “the heart of the mission”.Scientists expect to pick up as many as 100 quakes during the mission, which should last at least 26 Earth months, or one Martian year.Most of the quakes are expected to be less than magnitude 6.0.Studying how seismic waves pass through the crust, mantle and core of Mars can help scientists learn more about what the layers are made of and how deep they are.The second key instrument is a self-hammering probe that will monitor the flow of heat in the planet’s subsurface. Called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, it was made by the German space agency with the participation of the Polish space agency, and is the first of its kind to be used on Mars.The probe should go 15 times deeper than any previous Mars mission, to a depth of three to five metres, said Nasa.A third instrument will help scientists on Earth keep precise track of the lander’s location as Mars rotates.The US spent $813.8m on the spacecraft and rocket launch, while investments on the instruments from France and Germany amount to $180 million, according to Nasa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bce5728aad0757931e6613903a8a156d4f89ed08/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=766809ee1a54db98fbaabe4121417709 1400w","title":"epo suspect asbel kiprop athletics integrity unit","story":"The Athletics Integrity Unit has admitted that the Kenyan 1500m runner Asbel Kiprop was warned he was to have a drug test in advance – in violation of World Anti-Doping Agency rules – but has rejected his sensational claim that the failed sample was tampered with and EPO was added to it.The body also dismissed suggestions from Kiprop, a three-time world champion and former Olympic champion, that he had been offered an ambassadorship with athletics’ governing body, the IAAF, if he accepted a doping ban.The AIU did not, however, respond to claims from Kiprop that he had given money to doping control officers when they carried out his test in November 2017.In a statement, the AIU confirmed for the first time that EPO had been detected in Kiprop’s sample on 27 November 2017, that he was notified about the failed test on February 3, and he was charged with violating the IAAF anti-doping rules on 16 March.It also rejected Kiprop’s key accusation that his sample had been tampered with by doping control officers, saying it had been investigated and rejected. “The AIU is satisfied that there has been no mix-up or tampering with the sample and that the sample collected from the athlete on 27 November 2017 was the same sample analysed by the laboratory and reported as an adverse analytical finding.”The AIU said that despite this, it believed that his positive test would not be reversed – although it conceded that it would be up to a tribunal to decide. It also rejected Kiprop’s claim that the confidentiality of the proceedings had been breached by the AIU, and said that Kiprop was wrong to claim that he was offered a “reward” of being an IAAF ambassador on anti-doping.It added: “Prior to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings AIU investigators met with Mr Kiprop. The purpose of the meetings was to notify him of the positive test and give him the opportunity to admit any offence promptly or to provide information about doping in athletics that could amount to ‘substantial assistance’.“This is standard practice for the AIU when serious doping substances have been detected in any sample.

Talking to old-time jockeys about famous races is just about the most purely enjoyable gig you can get in my line of work and men like Stan are the reason why.There was only wry humour and enthusiasm in his voice as he explained why he felt he would have won that race, if only the loose Popham Down hadn’t brought the field to a standstill at the one after Becher’s. It would have been easy and entirely understandable to be bitter about the missed opportunity or the 1973 car crash in which he, a passenger, suffered career-ending injuries. “I was never going better than I was then,” Stan told me of his ride on Leedsy. “I would have won.”And the amazing context for that assertion is that he had been riding without stirrups for about a mile by then, one of his leathers having snapped at the water jump. Footage of the race clearly shows Stan, in hooped colours just behind the leaders, sitting easily in the saddle, his legs draped around the horse as Leedsy vaults over second Becher’s. There’s no sign of panic or tension or desperately clinging on. He’s just a jockey in unison with his mount as they soar over a fearsome obstacle despite the broken tack. What a horseman. Turning to today’s action, there’s 8-1 about Lydiate Lady (2.40), trying to sustain her excellent run at Musselburgh. Having joined Eric Alston for last season, she has won five of her last seven, including her reappearance run at Ripon a fortnight ago.The ground today will be a good bit faster than it was then but she has seemed versatile as to going and I fancy her to give her running again. Mosalim (3.40) is the nap, two races later, at about 7-4. Gelded over the winter, this lightly raced sort from the in-form William Haggas yard looks on a fair mark, in light of his novice success at Chelmsford last month. There should be plenty more to come from this half-brother to Aguerooo. “Can they do it on a wet Friday at Chepstow?” is a fair question to ask about fancy-bred Flat racers and today King Lud is the one who must answer. He was a fair fourth in the Wood Ditton last month but his yard has since gone a bit quiet and the fifth horse has been beaten at odds-on. In today’s novice race, King Lud comes up against the rather more experienced Coeur Blimey (2.30) from Sue Gardner’s yard, a horse who beat Ballyandy in a Listed bumper at Ascot all of three years ago. A decent hurdler since then, he could not cope with a Listed Flat race last month but this is a more straightforward opportunity and, at 15-8, I’ll take him to beat up the youngsters.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09db6085f4acea1578a337d55910b5f9bd18c91/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98774c1f0878a71534333cf3285349b4","title":"big time sensuality bjork ballet rave puts san francisco under its spell unbound festival","story":"Arthur Pita’s show mixes eight of the Icelandic singer’s tracks into a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale at the Unbound festival With 12 new works, two specially commissioned scores and the world’s first Björk ballet, the Unbound festival by San Francisco Ballet (SFB) properly lives up to its title. Yes, there may be some predictable names among the dozen commissioned choreographers yes, there are only two women among them. But artistic director Helgi Tomasson has undertaken an exhilarating experiment in California – challenging audiences to take a risk on four ambitious triple bills and challenging choreographers to cut loose and play.Arthur Pita has never needed permission to play. As delinquent and riotous as some of his choreography has been, the setting of eight Björk songs in Björk Ballet still looks like nothing he’s ever produced. Visually, the work is a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale: the stage transformed into a gled salt marsh by 40 clumps of silver grass the dancers costumed by Marco Morante to become, variously, a tinsel-cloaked fairy with raspberry-pink socks, a tango a, a scarlet butterfly and a chorus of clubbers in sequined muzzles.There is a hint of a story in the fisherman figure who wanders through the piece, alternately wearing sad and happy clown masks. At moments he cast his line as if fishing for dreams, and it is perhaps those dreams that Pita hears in Björk’s music. The scenarios include a group of lovers, locked in an underwater embrace a sexy goddess carried on a bier and a classical rave. A stageful of ballet dancers pogoing in perfect first position to Hyperballad is a sight to see.Viewed as pure choreography, some sections may seem disposable, even random, but as a synthesis of dance, music and design it becomes far more than the sum of its parts. Unlike so many pop-inspired ballets, Pita doesn’t ride the surface novelty of Björk’s music. Instead, he communicates something of the transgression, yearning, mischief and magic at its heart. Evanescent though it may be, Björk Ballet is a wonderful watch – surprising, mysterious and a ridiculous amount of fun.Pita is one of four British or British-based choreographers to feature in Unbound, and while he and Christopher Wheeldon have worked with SFB before, David Dawson and Cathy Marston are making their company debuts. Marston’s Snowblind is the more substantial, an adaptation of Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome, a bleak fable of love, possession and loss that proves a smart choice for a one-act ballet.Working with an arranged score by Philip Feeney, Marston whittles her material down to around 30 minutes of pure dance. She uses a modest-sized chorus to evoke the story’s crucial element of snow her drifting choreography not only its figurative representation but also of the claustrophobic situation in which three characters – Ethan, his wife, Zeena, and the free-spirited Mattie with whom he falls in love – are trapped. There is a superb chemistry between casting and choreography. Sarah Van Patten is terrifyingly good as Zeena – her hands clawed, her spine rigid and her gaze steely with possessiveness and pain. Mathilde Froustey’s Mattie is her quicksilver opposite, light, sensuous and supple. Ulrik Birkkjaer’s Ethan, his back bowed from years of dutiful service, develops poignant layers of rectitude and longing.Marston keeps her language plain and functional when she needs to move her story along, but it blooms vividly when focusing on the characters’ inner lives. In one finely judged image she has Mattie kneel and rest her head against Ethan’s leg, concentrating the spontaneity, sweetness and willingness that make her so lovable to him. When the errant lovers try to escape, and Mattie is paralysed in an accident, Marston masterfully tracks the changing dynamics of power in a trio that ends with the two lovers clasped in Zeena’s arms and Zeena triumphantly in charge.Snowblind is the only literary ballet to feature in the festival, but some of the most abstract-seeming works carry an implicit theme or personal story. Gender identity is subtly addressed in David Dawson’s Animus Anima, which plays with the traditional dynamics of male and female dance languages. In The Infinite Ocean, Edwaard Liang contemplates death in Bespoke, Stanton Welch meditates on the transience of a ballet career and in Wheeldon’s Bound To, a cast of mobile phone-clutching dancers tackle the world’s addiction to social media.Wheeldon doesn’t typically moralise as a choreographer, but this idea takes his work to some interestingly expressive places. When a phone-free Dores André tries to seduce Benjamin Freemantle into paying her proper attention, their duet becomes a cleverly evocative experiment in dysfunctional partnering she initiating the moves, while he absent-mindedly responds. An intricately fluid, intimate quartet has four women recalling a time when they used to talk rather than text while an affecting solo for Lonnie Weeks shows a man stranded in solitary anxiety, among a group of phone-transfixed friends.What’s odd is how little trust Wheeldon places in his own language. Each section comes with a title projected on to the stage – “Open your eyes” or “Take a deep breath” – and in tandem with Keaton Henson’s overly saccharine score, these preachy little captions seem to trivialise rather than concentrate the choreography’s message. Dance often works its deepest effects through the gaps and ambiguities of its language. In contrast to Wheeldon’s over-signalling, the charm of Trey McIntyre’s Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem lies in its willingness to let the audience find their own way into the material.The work is about McIntyre’s grandfather, who died after suffering years of dementia. Set to the waif-like folk songs of Chris Garneau, McIntyre’s choreography cleverly evokes the past without sentimentalising. Freemantle as the young grandfather dances among his male friends with a slightly stilted jocularity. He flirts with sweetly artless young women, and McIntyre adroitly captures their inidual vulnerabilities in the rawness of the characters’ steps and their eccentricities of phrasing. At the end, when Freemantle is left alone, dancing a strange, ragged duet with a three-legged stool, we glimpse the pain of the grandfather losing his mind and the choreographer trying to piece it back together.Flesh is a very personal work, authentic and generous these are qualities disappointingly absent from Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s Guernica. A homage to Picasso, it throws together sex, politics, cubism and Spain in a high-gloss spectacle of bull-horned lovers, flamenco and blood red lighting . It’s all too much and while I normally admire her work for its breadth of spirit, Guernica feels overwrought and hollow. It is marvellously danced, however, as are all the works in the festival. Even if there are moments when this elegant, versatile and committed company look as though they could have done with an extra rehearsal or two, it’s impressive how fully and deeply they embody the range of choreographic idioms that have been thrown at them.Standout performances include Angelo Greco, his moulded line and impassioned attack beautifully showcased in the pure neoclassicism of Welch’s Bespoke Yuan Yuan Tan, spooling her eerily graceful body though Liang’s Infinite Ocean Sofiane Sylve magnificently regal in just about everything and Maria Kochetkova as a ferocious modern-day Odile in Dawson’s Anima Animus.The company shine in Justin Peck’s Hurry Up We’re Dreaming, set to a sequence of tracks by M83 with 14 dancers dressed in trainers, shorts and jeans. Peck has a special genius for choreographing ensembles, creating surges and crosscurrents of dance that sparkle with brilliantly bevelled detail. The heart of this beautiful ballet lies in the long, quietly ecstatic duet for Sarah Van Patten and Luke Ingham – a sequence of low lifts, gently delineated balances, and unexpected changes of direction during which the two dancers seem to move together on a single breath.I saw all 12 works over a weekend, and in that concentrated viewing some of the festival’s choreographers appeared markedly braver than others. But overall these ballets constitute a fine statement of faith in the future of the art form. If I were Tomasson and cherry-picking my dream triple bill, Peck, Marston and Pita’s works would be frontrunners, but Wheeldon, Dawson and McIntyre’s would not be far behind. Lucky San Francisco, to be so spoiled for choice.• Unbound festival runs in San Francisco until 5 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd9579f17be7bcadb3045e69034df8984cbf311e/0_136_4249_2549/master/4249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebb7e874ee67c1196e3bda1e63b0e8fc","title":"twitter change password bug discovered","story":"Company says it has fixed the internal glitch and has seen ‘no indication of breach or misuse’ but recommends precautionary stepsTwitter has urged its 336 million users to change their passwords after the company discovered a bug that stored passwords in plain text in an internal system.The company said it had fixed the problem and had seen “no indication of breach or misuse”, but it suggested users consider changing their password on Twitter and on all services where they have used the same password “as a precaution”.“We are very sorry this happened,” said Twitter’s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal, in a blogpost. “We recognise and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.”Companies with good security practices typically store user passwords in a form that cannot be read.

But were these all-white mansplaining marathons ever as progressive as they made out?They don’t make TV like this any more. “You used to sacrifice and kill us publicly,” intones John Berger, plummily speaking for the animal kingdom over a montage of depressed bears behind bars at the zoo and sad-eyed horses in a field. “Today your slaughterhouses are hidden away. It’s not from us that you hide them, is it? It’s from yourselves.”True, it’s presumptuous, perhaps even speciesist, for the great art historian and novelist to ventriloquise caged gorillas and butchered cattle, the better to indict humanity’s denial and unconscious self-loathing over what it does to animals. But that’s exactly what Berger does in a beautiful and chastening film he made for the BBC’s Omnibus in 1980 called Parting Shots from Animals. Berger’s thought is that we used to worship animals, put them in pride of place in our art. They were our gods, our companions, our soulmates. We would hunt with them and eat them without shame. But then, 300 years ago, something terrible happened. The philosopher René Descartes decided humans were essentially different from animals, supposing that only the former had souls and that the latter were kinds of furry robots. Later, during the industrial revolution, animals were further marginalised when we made machines that could more efficiently labour for us. Now? We have disappeared animals from public life, as ruthlessly as Stalin or Pinochet.What happened to TV with such radical political and cultural messages? Arguably it died in 2003 when the BBC took Omnibus behind the shed and put a bullet through its brain or in 1995 when it decided that The Late Show was not subversive TV but an expendable luxury product for the wannabe intelligentsia or when Channel 4 mutated from Britain’s most self-consciously radical TV channel into one that made Embarrassing Bodies and Making Bradford British.We used to have The Late Show with Sarah Dunant now we have The Late Late Show with James Corden. You can’t tell me that isn’t symptomatic of television’s decline.Berger’s film is just one of a clutch of radical programmes drawn from BBC and Channel 4 archives curated for an afternoon screening under the title Theory on TV at London’s Whitechapel Gallery on 5 May as part of a season of archival trawls called Radical Broadcasts, in which I’m participating. Later in the month, there will be an evening at at London’s Institut Français of archived TV films about Gallic theory including a Late Show about Roland Barthes and Channel 4 show about Jacques Derrida and Hélène Cixous. Bet you can’t wait.Sadly, though, you’ve missed a screening of the time RD Laing appeared on daytime chat show Good Afternoon in 1977. To get a sense of how counterintuitive the psychiatrist’s interview was, imagine radical feminist Catharine Mackinnon popping up on Loose Women or or the Chapman Brothers making a showstopper challenge of their artwork Hell in Bake Off. All of which, incidentally, would happen if I ever get to be a commissioning editor. Which, by popular demand, I won’t. Other films to be screened on Saturday include David Lodge grappling with post-structuralist theory at a conference on the linguistics of writing at Strathclyde University in 1986 Stuart Hall and David MacLennan discussing why Karl Marx mattered in 1983 and Edward Said musing on how ostensibly great western literature is complicit in the crimes of empire in 1993. What all the above shows have in common is that they are unthinkable on today’s telly. Pitch any one of them to a commissioning editor in 2018 and you’d get shown the door. Cultural studies professors talk about Marx? Are you kidding? Edward Said expatiates on the western hubris of Kipling and Conrad? “Expatiates”? Christ, no! This meeting is over!And yet, TV has lost a lot in switching off its radical intellectuals. Take Said’s superb documentary, a bracing distillation of the themes of his book Culture and Imperialism. Suited, booted and staring down the camera as if the TV audience was his class at Columbia University, the intellectual begins an authored hour called The Idea of Empire, broadcast in 1993 not long after the first Gulf war. “When you read a brilliantly elegant and ironic novel, do you think of colonial slavery?” he began. “Or when you read a brooding existential narrative by Albert Camus, do you think of the atrocities of the Algerian war of independence? Or when you watch images of the Gulf war and you see the technological superiority of the the American army and air force, do you think of European Orientalists?” A beat. “I think you should.” I know I felt roundly told off.In 2018, if you want to encounter dissenting radical voices, turn off your telly and download podcasts such as Counterpunch radio, or Agitpod with Owen Jones and Ellie Mae O’Hagan, the Australian Radical Philosophy podcast and my personal favourite, This Is Hell (slogan: manufacturing dissent since 1996). Intellectual dissent is too difficult for TV to handle - which is especially disappointing nowadays, when viewers seem to have no difficulty dealing with the most complicated, often philosophically dense, dramas in the medium’s history including The OA, Legion and Westworld, to name just three. Oh come on, you might well say. There is radical telly on prime time still. Think of David Olusoga or Mary Beard presenting their segments of Civilisations on BBC One recently. And it’s true that Olosuga’s critique of empire and Beard’s feminist deconstruction of patriarchal art history were two fingers to Kenneth Clark’s 50-year-old patrician narrative. And, better yet, a person of colour and a woman got to tell the story. That said, any subversion in Civilisations was itself subverted by the way the series bent the knee to the prevailing values of the licence-fee-depleting, visually narcotising travelogue. The BBC boasted that the eight-programme documentary ned 31 countries on six continents, and covered more than 500 works of art. The soothing wallow in unceasing beauty diluted the abrasiveness of the professors’ radical messages.  Olusoga’s perversely sumptuous critique of empire made Said’s earlier meditation on the same theme seem like guerrilla film-making. Instead of flying Said all over the world to look moody in photogenic locales, it parked him in his New York apartment, where he would hold court to camera. Otherwise, the visuals consisted overwhelmingly of archive newsreels and 8mm footage filmed of Said by his father in pre-1947 Palestine and 50s Egypt, where the tyro intellectual spent his formative years. More energy, more airtime, and much, much less money were spent on argument than on visually beguiling viewers.There’s no way, though, back to these kinds of radical programmes. We will never hear a voiceover again by someone as posh-sounding as dear old John Berger. A much more important reason is that these programmes weren’t quite as radical as they may have seemed. Where were the women? Where were the black or brown intellectuals? Take Hall and McLennan riffing on Marx’s relevance in the early 80s. Watching this recently, as both men swivelled in their armchairs and chatted to host historian Juliet Gardiner, it gave me a Proustian rush – reminding me of my experience of so much TV discussion in the 70s and 80s, when men would lean back in their chairs as they held forth about something abstruse (think: Bryan Magee on The Great Philosophers or Tony Benn puffing at his pipe before telling Robin Day about socialism), until that sexless moment two inches of male calf emerged between sock and trouser leg. These calf exposures were emblematic, too, of how putatively intellectual radical TV got so up itself, so comfortable at hearing the sound of its own unchallenged voice, that it became part of the problem.If radical TV has a future, and it probably doesn’t, it cannot return to such production values and can’t just involve patrician, calf-exposing male intellectuals setting the world to rights. But something needs to change. Britain’s got talent? Maybe, but in 2018 our TV has very little subversive to say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d77e3b19842a5b4b3b0fdbd6baaed8ae579433ba/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f2e849b9e69a26055e960571fd4c732","title":"hawaii evacuations ordered as kilauea volcano erupts","story":"Lava spurts through cracks in roads and flows in residential areas on Big IslandA whole town has been ordered to evacuate after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island caused lava to flow in residential areas.All 1,500 inhabitants of Pahoa were told to leave after steam and lava poured out of a crack in the nearby Leilani Estates. Lava spurted into the sky from the road and aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest.Resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread over an area of about 180 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday. He said it sounded like a jet engine.Residents had been warned for the last week that they should prepare to evacuate, with officials saying an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres were providing shelter.Earlier in the week, a school in the Puna district was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain.Since Monday, hundreds of earthquakes – most of them about 2.0 magnitude – have been recorded in the area. The Puu Oo, which is a volcanic cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kīlauea volcano, began to collapse on Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into newly created underground chambers.Officials said it was impossible to predict how long the eruption would last.Jeremiah Osuna, who captured drone footage of the lava stream, told the Honolulu television station KOHN that it sounded as if someone “put a bunch of rocks into a dryer”. He said he could smell the sulphur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.The US Geological Survey said fresh cracks in the ground were reported on Thursday afternoon and hot vapour and lava began to erupt.The geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed below Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.

It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high.

The excavation proves early humans colonised the Philippines hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously believed, though it is thought these hominims, or ‘Hobbits’, pre-date modern humans, known as homosapiens. Previously, the earliest confirmed evidence of human presence on the island was a foot bone found in a cave in Luzon, which dates back just 67,000 years. Aside from their appetite for rhino, very little is known about the humans who would have occupied Luzon, and the researchers are hoping to uncover more archeological clues as they continue to dig.It is possible they were homo erectus, who are known to have wandered to present-day China and south-east Asia up to a million years ago or could be their own distinct sub-species. Until recently, it was believed Luzon and the other islands of Wallacea in the Philippines would have been impossible for pre-modern humans to reach, as they would not have boats to cross the deep water. However, the team of researchers, including paleontologist Dr Gerrit Van Den Bergh from the University of Wollongong, said this called for a rethink of how and where early homonims had travelled in south-east Asia. “Our hypothesis is that the ‘Hobbit’ ancestors came from the north, rather than travelling eastward through Java and Bali,” said Ven Den Bergh, whose work was published in the journal Nature.“They may have been caught in a tsunami and carried out to sea. Those kinds of freak, random events are probably responsible for these movements of humans and animals. This region is tectonically active so tsunamis are common and there are big ones every hundred years or so.” The researchers unearthed tools including 49 sharp-edge flakes and two possible hammer stones, while 13 rhino bones showed signs of being hit with hammers and one was smashed entirely, possibly to get access to the edible marrow inside.Also among the remains were skeletons of a monitor lizard, Philippine brown deer, freshwater turtles and stegodons, an early incarnation of the elephant. Whether they were also on the dinner plates of the early human occupants of Luzon is still unknown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcf62574808299249eb3b93fb039e47051d7f7da/0_0_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b5bb53f718bb495eae9661c7bebf347","title":"italy looks set for fresh elections as it enters third month without government","story":"President Sergio Mattarella calls for fresh consultations to try to make three main political forces agree deal to form governmentItaly enters its third month without a government on Friday as warring parties fail to break a post-election impasse that now looks likely to usher in a fresh vote by the end of the year.Two months after inconclusive elections in March led to political deadlock, president Sergio Mattarella has called for a fresh round of consultations in a last-ditch attempt to get the parties to agree a deal to form a government. On Monday, the three main political forces will have just one day to cast aside their differences and come up with a solution after two exploratory mandates failed to yield results.After a promising start, relations between Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, and M5S’s Luigi Di Maio soured over the latter’s insistence that Salvini abandon his coalition partner, Italy’s disgraced former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.Meanwhile talks between arch rivals M5S and the Democratic party were scotched after another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who still holds considerable power over the party, said he would not back a government led by M5S. The Democratic party, currently headed by caretaker leader Maurizio Martina, met on Thursday to decide whether or not to pursue formal negotiations with M5S. But Renzi’s stance is likely to hold sway.“There is a brutal struggle for power and I think Renzi will win – he’s in control of the party but, at the same time, this is the first time there has been a real revolt against him,” said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Sapienza University in Rome.“At the same time, Mattarella is asking for responsibility and there is a side of the Democratic party that is sensitive to what the president says and afraid of being in opposition. If there is space to move, they would prefer to be in government.”If Monday’s talks fail, then Mattarella is likely to seek a transitional government, potentially handpicking a leader, that would deal with matters such as approving the 2019 budget before new elections are held.Di Maio is pushing for an immediate re-vote, while Salvini, whose party has strengthened in polls since March, is said to favour a ballot towards the end of the year.Many Italians are unimpressed with the latest period of political paralysis gripping their country. “We are fed up and I don’t want to have another vote,” said Marina Mari, who voted for M5S in the March elections.“It would be a huge waste of money to hold another election. I trust Mattarella, but not the rest. But if the outcome on Monday means a government between M5S and the League, then at least it’s something.”“Salvini is in the best position because his electorate is more solid than the Five Star’s,” he said.But ahead of fresh elections, other experts say the League and M5S would need to agree on a new electoral law that would make it easier to achieve an absolute majority.“Needless to say, a French-style two-round system springs to mind,” Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based consultancy firm, wrote in a note earlier this week.“Although crafting one that does not get a thumbs down from the constitutional court may be a daunting task. One that requires at least an entente cordiale between the League and M5S.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d620df369a986a809ed16cfc25537fab5405c5e/47_5_664_398/master/664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce8fba666359d901ab3917d5e927857d","title":"senior new zealand naval officer accused of hiding camera in embassy toilets","story":"Alfred Keating pleads not guilty over discovery of miniature camera in embassy bathroom in Washington where he was defence attacheOne of New Zealand’s most senior naval officers is accused of hiding a secret camera in the toilets of the New Zealand embassy in Washington, in an attempt to obtain intimate footage of people using the bathroom. Alfred Keating, 58, was a commodore in the New Zealand navy and was one of the country’s most senior naval officers before he resigned last month.Keating was serving as a defence attache embassy in Washington in July 2017. On 27 July a small covert camera was discovered in a unisex bathroom in the embassy when it fell out of a hiding spot in a heating duct.It had been positioned to capture images of anyone using the toilet. The embassy toilet was generally used by approximately 60 embassy staff.New Zealand police travelled to Washington to investigate, and brought the recording device back to be forensically examined.The investigation revealed the device had been in place for some months, as the homemade platform it was mounted on was covered in a thick layer of dust.On the day it was discovered the camera had been activated at 9am and had captured 19 images over a five-hour period of people using the bathroom.A search warrant of Keating’s home in New Zealand led to him being charged with attempting to obtain intimate visual recordings.The prosecution alleges that Keating’s computer contained software to operate the camera, and also that his DNA matched that found on the SD card inside the camera.

This marks the largest first-quarter increase since 2014.The average rent across the State during the first three months of the year was €1,261, a monthly increase of €232 compared to the previous peak in 2008. Commenting on the latest figures, Dr Ronan Lyons, assistant professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and author of the report, said rents across the country were considerably higher than in a decade ago despite general prices having barely changed during the same period.“It is clear that, for those who have to look for a new home in the open market, rental inflation remains well above any reasonable measure of health. But as ever, rents are only the symptom,” said Dr Lyons.“The cause remains a chronic and worsening lack of rental supply. Policy must focus on dramatically increasing the construction of urban apartments over the coming years, in order to meet both the backlog of demand and the country’s needs over coming years and decades,” he added.In Dublin, where the accommodation crisis is particularly acute, rents are now 30 per cent higher than their previous Celtic Tiger peak.Rents in the capital rose by 12.8 per cent over the year to March. Other urban centres also showed significant increases with rents up 17.1 per cent in Limerick. In Waterford, the rise was 14.6 per cent while in Galway and Cork, prices rose by 13.6 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively.Outside the five main cities, rents were up by an average of 10.1 per cent.According to Daft, there were 3,200 properties available to rent nationwide in the first four months of 2018. This is the lowest number ever recorded for this time of year by the website, and marks a 17 per cent decline versus the same period a year earlier. In 2009 by contrast, an average of almost 21,000 properties were available.In Dublin, there were just 1,265 homes available to rent last month, one-third below the average over the last five years.The country needs close to 50,000 homes a year to cater to underlying housing demand with more than 15,000 rental homes required a year. Dr Lyons said the latest figures would not be welcomed by policymakers given that they show the introduction of rental increase caps in cities have failed.“By focusing on limiting rent increases, rather than boosting the supply of rental accommodation, policy is merely shuffling the fixed stock of rental homes between a number of tenants and prospective tenants,” he said.

Temperatures will start to creep up from Friday with the cool north-easterly winds of recent days being replaced by warm air from the Azores. All parts of the country with the exception of west and north-westerly coastal fringes will have a sunny weekend.Friday will see highs of 18 degrees and it will be mostly dry. Saturday will be a brighter day with sunny spells and highs of 19 degrees.Sunday and Monday will see the fine weather continue and will get the warmest of the sunshine. Temperatures will be between 20 and 21 degrees in parts of the midlands and east. Tuesday will be the last day of the current good spell. The best weather will be in the southeast. Current indications suggest that on Wednesday, rain will spread from the west with showers bringing cooler conditions.The forecast is excellent news for those attending the biggest events of the bank holiday weekend: the Ed Sheeran concerts in Cork’s Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The forecast is for the fine weather to persist for all three concerts which will attract 120,000 music fans to the newly refurbished stadium. It is also set to be fair for the Bon Secours Hospital Great Limerick Run on Sunday which is the largest participant event outside Dublin taking place in Ireland every year. About 14,200 participants are expected to take part in the three races. The Shine a Light on Summer Festival will take place over the weekend at five lighthouses - at Fanad Head in Donegal, at Hook, the world’s oldest working lighthouse in Wexford, at Loop Head and on the islands of Rathlin in the North and Valentia in the south west. Details are here: http:www.greatlighthousesstoriesshine-a-light-2018. There will be talks and tours of the lighthouse. There will be widespread disruption on Dart and train services north of Connolly Station over the bank holiday weekends. There will be no Dart services between Connolly and HowthMalahide on Saturday and Sunday. On northern commuter routes bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Malahide, with trains between Malahide and DroghedaDundalk, to a revised schedule. On the Belfast Enterprise, bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Drogheda, with trains between Drogheda and Belfast. Irish Water Safety has issued a bank holiday appeal to the public to always wear a lifejacket when boating and to ensure that children are supervised while swimming. Despite the early summer weather, Irish Water Safety has warned that sea temperatures, at an average of 9 degrees, are too cold for an extended swim.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

island state\u0027s governor signed an emergency proclamation releasing disaster funds to the Big Island in the eruption\u0027s wake.Local news footage showed streams of lava snaking through a forest and authorities reported steam and lava emissions from a crack in Leilani Subision in the area of Mohala Street following the blast.Residents of that impacted area, some 1,700 people, were under mandatory evacuation after the burst from Kilauea, one of the most active volcanos in the world.In addition to the obligatory evacuations, many areas fell under voluntary evacuation zones, affecting some 10,000 people, according to a local official.A plume of ash rises from the Puu Oo vent on Hawaii\u0026#39s Kilaueaa volcano US Geological Survey authorities of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory

12 different countries Best known for the unforgettable image of a scowling celestial body annoyed that a rocket ship has crashed into its eye in A Trip to the Moon (1902), Melies was most recently seen in Martin Scorsese\u0027s film Hugo (2011) where he was played in old age by Sir Ben Kingsley.He was born in 1861, the son of luxury shoemakers who - after attending the prestigious Lycee Louis-le-Grand, completing military service and serving an apprenticeship as a clerk in London - shunned the family business to work as a conjurer at the Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris.Here, Melies developed a fondness for stagecraft and visual effects, working with mechanical automata, trapdoors and lighting, eventually selling his boot factory shares to his brothers and buying the theatre outright. After seeing the Lumiere Brothers sensational moving picture camera in action in 1895, Melies rushed out to establish his own studio and began making films that featured clever illusions and tricks created by experimenting with double exposure, cutting and rewinding, building on his theatrical innovations.Using elaborate painted sets akin to those of Paris\u0027s music halls, Melies was a true pioneer who played a key role in the evolution of cinematic technique and the medium\u0027s storytelling grammar.He also had an acute sensitivity for the sort of blockbuster spectacle audiences would be attracted to.Specialising in horror and steam punk science fiction, taking inspiration from the fiction of late Victorian visionaries Jules Verne and HG Wells, his most famous film remains A Trip To The Moon, which starred acrobats and dancers from the Folies Bergere and the Chatelet ballet.As fantastic as this is, perhaps even more extraordinary is the later Tunnelling The English Channel (1907), in which he effectively predicted the advent of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel.Other celebrated works including The Vanishing Lady, The Haunted Castle (both 1896), The Astronomer\u0027s Dream (1898), Bluebeard (1901), The Impossible Voyage (1904), The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906) and Baron Munchausen (1911).The aftermath of a cyclone in a short by Georges Melies (Getty)Tragically, after more than 500 short films, Melies\u0027s career collapsed with the onset of the First World War. He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.An early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison\u0027s representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.Later reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.What was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.However, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d\u0027Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Amazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.The world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 video for Tonight, Tonight (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. Thousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.Most breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.A record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Melanie McGrice, who was not involved with the study, said: “As a fertility dietician, I’m seeing more and more women who incorrectly think that they should be avoiding fruit in an effort to help them conceive.“This study demonstrates that fruit consumption is not only safe, but beneficial for most women to optimise their fertility.“Fruit is rich in antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals, and should not be lumped into the same basket as sugar and soft drinks.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The department’s top civil servants acknowledged the fear of some “clunky fixes” and that some functions would not be performed “as slickly as they are at the moment”. Both problems would arise if the government fails to secure an exit deal, or that deal is rejected by parliament, and it carries out its “no deal” exit threat.The committee demanded an update from Defra by next month, “in case negotiations break down”.“Given its poor track record on IT delivery, Defra must ensure it has the necessary resources in place to complete its IT programmes on time and avoid costly and embarrassing contingencies involving manual completion and submission of forms,” it said.Ms Hillier added: “Departments are under extreme pressure.

All departments have much to do.”The report also criticised the Treasury for failing to set out, until March, how much funding each department would receive in 2018-19 to prepare for Brexit.It eventually announced that Defra would be allocated £310m and Dit £74m, out of a total pot of £1.6bn.Department for Environmental Food \u0026 Rural Affairsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That said, we want people to know it is an issue we take very seriously in the Labour Party.Council leader Richard Cornelius, a Conservative councillor, also said voters were generally more concerned about local issues rather than accusations of antisemitism within Labour.It\u0027s things like potholes, the collection of their rubbish bins and keeping the council tax low, he said.Of course there is a concern about anti-Semitism in the Jewish areas, and of course there is a wider concern about more generally - people are horrified, and Labour have to address that.It\u0027s been very close.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsThe Conservatives controlled Barnet from 2002 until it fell back into no overall control this March when one of their councillors, Sury Khatri, resigned.They made concerted efforts to target wards with large Jewish populations in the wake of the controversy convulsing Labour.The breakthrough came when they took a seat off Labour in Hale ward and all three from the long-time Labour stronghold of West Hendon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown on the predictions and which were correct.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour also targeted Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.But results revealed Labour have failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster from the Conservatives, but they have gained Plymouth.The Lib Dems kept hold of Sutton, their last London council, and managed to snatch Richmond-upon-Thames.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.This morning Trafford turned red as the Conservatives lost their narrow majority but they held their majority on the other three councils.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Stockport, Dudley, Walsall, and North East Lincolnshire have remained as councils with no overall control with Newcastle-under-Lyme sill yet to declare.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that backed Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party also targeted Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.Basildon turned blue but Colchester and Portsmouth are still councils with no overall control. Pendle is expected to declare this afternoon.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 showed 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.The stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, as a large Jewish population could reject Labour over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.Prof Curtice was proved correct with his prediction for Basildon and Peterborough as both turned blue last. Pendle is yet to declare and Rugby stayed Conservative.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold on to Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn and Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.Ukips electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and all eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark and Tower Hamlets are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimated two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge and Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth and Hackney being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are committed to the highest standards of food safety and clearly we’ve fallen short on this occasion.We’ve spoken to the customer to apologise and to try and put this right for her.”Nestle said they had not received any complaints, saying: If the product was sold after its best before date we would always advise a consumer to return it to the retailer for a replacement.SMA is manufactured under strict regulations and includes a number of measures to ensure safety. When the best before date runs out it doesnt mean that the product will be harmful or unsafe, but that it might begin to lose its flavour and texture."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402525992.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"world press freedom day","story":"The men and women killed in the Afghan capital werent soldiers - they werent even armed. They were journalists, murdered on the job as they tried to report on the details of an earlier bombing.On the same day, BBC reporter was shot dead in the countrys eastern Khost province, marking the day out as the the deadliest day for journalists since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015.It makes it all the more poignant that today is World Press Freedom Day, a date to celebrate the principles of press freedom and defend reporters around the world from attacks like these.Without a free press, its impossible to hold the powerful to account, expose injustices and fight for justice on the issues affecting ordinary people.And the world would become a far more confusing place without the reporters who dedicate their lives to unearthing the truth and sharing it with us all.Compared to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, where journalists are routinely killed or jailed, it may seem like we have little use for Press Freedom day in the UK.But the sad truth is that there are major issues with press freedom close to home as well.Last month, Reporters Without Borders released its Press Freedom Index - a record of how free the media in each country is, based on the threat of government clampdowns and intimidation by journalists.Staggeringly, the UK came 40th out of 180 countries - worse than every other Western European nation apart from Italy.Best five countriesNotable othersWhen the index began in 2002, the UK ranked 22nd - but since then our position in the freedom league table has plummeted.This is partly due to the threats of Parliaments Data Protection Bill, which would force tougher rules on the press and give the state more power to regulate and ultimately muzzle the media.Another problem for press freedom in the UK is the general “climate of hostility towards the media”, which has seen British journalists threatened and intimidated online just for doing their job.Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, has received so much online abuse that she was assigned her own bodyguard last year.In other countries, like Afghanistan, press freedom is under threat from bombs and bullets as well as from the government and social media.On Monday, a bomb went off during rush hour in Kabul, and journalists in the city rushed to the scene so they could cover the story.But an ISIS fighter arrived at the site of the blast with them, disguised as a reporter.He joined the crowd of journalists on the scene and detonated - hammering home the warning that an official press vest can mark reporters out as targets, rather than affording them any protection.These deaths bring the total number of journalists killed so far this year to 24.In 2017, the total stood at 82, with 13 journalists killed in Mexico, 12 in Afghanistan and 11 in Iraq - the three most dangerous places to be a journalist.The years total was the lowest tally since 2007, according to the International Federation of Journalists, but it is still 82 too many.Elsewhere in the world, journalists still face the threat of being locked up for the crime of exposing the truth.Last year, 262 journalists were arrested - the highest number in almost three decades.Turkey is the worst offender, with 73 journalists currently behind bars, while 41 journalists have been imprisoned in China and 20 in Egypt.Its a sign that, on World Press Freedom Day, we have a long way to go and hard battles to fight before journalists around the world can be free to do their jobs without fear.But today is also a day to be thankful for the brave reporters who rush selflessly into danger armed with only their cameras and notebooks.And it is a day to remember all the journalists who have already given their lives in pursuit of a story. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tenants across the country should not be stung by unexpected costs.That’s why we’re delivering our promise to ban letting fees, alongside other measures to make renting fairer and more transparent.But the Bill is not set to become law for at least another year, meaning thousands of renters will have to pay an extra £233 on average in the meantime.And charities today raised concerns that loopholes in the legislation could still be slapped on through the back door.Dan Wilson Craw, Director of Generation Rent, said today: “There is a risk that not all tenants will be protected thanks to an exemption that could let some landlords continue to charge fees on spurious grounds and will be hard to police properly. This potential loophole should be taken out of the legislation.“And setting the cap on deposits at six weeks’ rent leaves in place a big barrier to moving home. The government needs to look at how to reduce the burden of this, for example by allowing the transfer of deposits between tenancies.”Britains chronic housing shortage is the second most important issue to the public, new studies have said.Theresa May has vowed to fix Britains broken housing market, vowing more new homes and ripping up planning rules which slow building down.She says she wants to build more homes more quickly and promised to ease the misery of millions of private renters too.Earlier this month she insisted that renters must be treated like human beings and said she would protect them from cowboy agents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was more than a courtier and much more than a friend.He danced with her. He joked with her. He served her and guided her. And when her marriage hit a rocky patch, he comforted her.In her 92 years, no other man has ever been that close to the Queen, apart from Prince Philip.In 1975, when bachelor Plunket died from liver cancer aged just 51, the Queen was plunged into grief.Breaching all protocol, she ordered a royal funeral for him at St James’s Palace. Again, she broke precedent by attending his memorial service.Then she ordered that a memorial temple should be built to him in Windsor Great Park. She had a hand in its design and chose the flowers to be planted around it.Many times since Plunket’s death, when the Queen has gone to watch polo at nearby Smith’s Lawn, she has slipped away to sit, alone, beside the white-painted colonnaded temple built in her friend’s name in the park’s beautiful Valley Gardens.Nobody ever mentions these visits — nobody ever has — as the grief is too private.Such behaviour from a monarch who has spent a lifetime shielding her emotions from her subjects is unprecedented. But then, as Elizabeth was to confess herself, there was nobody to equal Patrick Plunket.They had been friends since childhood. But when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, aged 25, the relationship changed . . . and deepened.Patrick’s father, Irish peer Lord Plunket, had been a close friend of Elizabeth’s parents, then the Duke and Duchess of York.Plunket’s mother Dorothé was a half-American heiress and the couple were worldly and sophisticated members of the international set.But when Patrick was just 15 they died in a plane crash and he inherited the family title.In World War Two he served in the Irish Guards, then became an equerry for Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. When Elizabeth became queen, she appointed him Deputy Master of the Household.As such he masterminded the Queen’s banquets and State receptions, as well as the Royal Ascot house parties. He revelled in it, loving nothing more than to please and surprise his royal boss.As they discussed menus, guest lists and ways to keep boring guests at arm’s length, they became closer.Plunket’s cousin, Lady Annabel Goldsmith — mother of Jemima — said: “He adored her from the outset.“They enjoyed a very special connection. He was the one member of her staff who could talk to her on equal terms.“There was an openness and honesty between them based on respect, friendship — and a lot of teasing.”But the relationship was more than that. In 1956, when Prince Philip disappeared off on a world tour for four months on the royal yacht Britannia, Plunket provided a shoulder for the Queen to lean on, helping her through the lonely days and weeks.The royal marriage had reached a crisis point. Prince Philip had devoted himself to rejuvenating the monarchy and to selflessly serving the wife he loved, but there were impossible pressures on him.Yet the reforms that Philip sought in the Palace and beyond were often turned aside or ignored.“I’m just a bloody amoeba,” he complained, implying he was only there to father the next monarch — and nothing more.Philip’s 1956 tour seemed endless, and nobody seemed to know when he would come home. Questions were asked in the House of Commons.Reports started appearing in the American press of a serious rift in the royal marriage and rumours came back from Australasia of girls and parties aboard the Britannia.It was hastily arranged for the Queen to meet her husband in Lisbon, Portugal, before he returned home. And perhaps in a moment of panic, worrying that she might lose him, she made Philip a Prince of the United Kingdom — until then he had been only a Greek prince.At Windsor, Plunket continued to hold the Queen’s hand throughout the crisis. Lady Goldsmith said: “He was tall, impeccably dressed, with a voice full of merriment and his eyes crinkled up with laughter. He radiated an irrepressible sense of fun.”Philip finally came home and the royal marriage was rekindled.There had been a ten-year gap between the birth of Princess Anne and their next child, Prince Andrew — but things were back on track. If Philip had had an itch, it had been well and truly scratched.And yet there was still a need for Patrick Plunket by the Queen’s side.Her biographer, Sarah Bradford, said: “While Philip was off dancing with one of his women friends, Plunket would whirl Elizabeth on to the floor.“He’d notice at parties if she was looking lonely, scoop her up and dance with her, always there if she looked a bit lonely.”Royal biographer Charles Higham added: “He was slender, handsome, with thinning, dark hair and aristocratic profile. The Queen was very fond of him, very probably in love with him.”Historian Sir Roy Strong added: “He was one of the few who could give the Queen a glimpse of the world outside.”Plunket was not just playful, he was practical too. When the Queen discovered she needed a tiara for a formal occasion and found the Buckingham Palace safe was locked, he raced away and came back with a Plunket family heirloom.When she visited his house — a rare honour for a royal servant, however lordly — she teased him for looking “like a dentist” in the expensive portrait he had recently commissioned from artist Graham Sutherland.They laughed together a lot, especially during those crisis years. And even when he was terminally ill, he struggled from his sickbed to attend one last formal duty at Buckingham Palace, numbed by morphine as he tied his bow tie.That night, the Queen and her adoring courtier knew it would be the last time they would meet.Weeks later, at his memorial service at the Guards Chapel, his cousin Lady Goldsmith glanced at the Queen and “caught a look of deep sadness”.For the only time in her life, Her Majesty had a hand in writing an obituary for The Times, stressing Plunket’s unselfish service and duty.The article made it sound as though his service was for the whole Royal Family — but its meaning was clear to those who had witnessed Elizabeth and Plunket laughing together.A year after his death, with the position still vacant, a courtier asked the Queen who would replace him as Deputy Master of the Royal Household. She answered: “No one will ever replace him.”And so to the questions many people will be asking — was the Queen ever tempted? Was she unfaithful to Prince Philip, a man who has never quite escaped the swirl and fog of gossip about his own private life?Did Her Majesty succumb to the charms and handsome good looks of the 7th Lord Plunket?Royal biographer Robert Lacey, doesn’t think so. He said: “Opinions vary on Plunket’s sexuality,” and he quoted a fellow Guards officer who said: “He was one of those lucky characters who was just neutral.”But Charles Higham has a different take. He said: “Even if her royal duty had not been utterly binding, she could never have entered into a relationship with him, because he was homosexual.”Whatever the level of their relationship, it was intense and lasting. He was the only other man in her life.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With nearly two thirds of the councils declared, all three parties had slightly increased their number of councillors - at the expense of Ukip, which has almost totally collapsed.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield City region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403202728.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"these people are sharing the strangest things theyve seen while travelling on the new york subway","story":"Commuters in London probably could tell their own tales of some weird stuff seen going on down underground on the tube, but New Yorkers just have to go one better.Is it really essential to have your umbrella up while going up or down town, inside a train that’s underground?Or maybe you just prefer to travel au naturel and let it all hang out?Perhaps you feel you were born to be wild but life got in the way of your dreams, so now you decide to ride your little moped whilst riding the network.Then again why stand or sit like every other normal, sane person when you can try to impersonate Spiderman and hang upside down."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403461731.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather may day bank holiday 28c beach traffic","story":"Traffic is already building up on major roads across the country as sun-seekers race to coastlines to make the most of the balmy extended weekend.Steamy hot conditions on Monday will eclipse sunny hotspots across Europe, with temperatures in Benidorm forecast for just 21C.This afternoon is expected to be the busiest time on the roads with 2.9 million trips, peaking in the early evening.Rod Dennis, RAF traffic spokesman, said: Many will be keen to make the most of the early May warmth by escaping in the car to spend time with family or friends - especially after the recent chilly spell that even lead to some overnight frosts at the start of this week.

Can you confirm we’re cleared to land?”Officials allegedly confirmed that the runway was clear but were not aware the plane was lined up to land on the crowded parallel taxiway instead.The pilot eventually aborted the landing after his co-pilot ordered him to go around go around after the officer looked outside and noticed it didnt look right”.Air Canada has not yet disclosed if any action was taken against the pilot and first officer after both told air investigators they were left tired after manoeuvring around thunderstorms earlier in the flight.According to the NTSB report, the 56-year-old flight captain has 20,000 hours flying experience, and the first officer had 10,000.In previously released audio from the cockpits of aircraft on the runway at the time, concerned pilots could be heard exclaiming: “Air Canada flew directly over us”.Speaking to Mercury News, retired United Airlines Capt. Ross Aimer said the outcome of a collision of this nature could have been “horrific”.He said: If it is true, what happened probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history.If you could imagine an Airbus colliding with four passenger aircraft wide bodies, full of fuel and passengers, then you can imagine how horrific this could have been.This is pretty huge.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403438772.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lidl cannabis products europe switzerland hemp tobacco","story":"The sale of cannabis has been legal in Switzerland to people who are 18 and over since 2011, as long as it contains no more than 1% of THC - the psychoactive substance that gets you high.As an alternative to rolling tobacco you can now buy a 1.5g box of cannabis made from hemp flowers that are grown indoors.The product is on sale at Lidl, beside the cigarettes at the till - though the cost is double what a normal cigarette would cost.It retails at 18 Swiss francs - equivalent to £13.20 - and is only available in Switzerland.Lidl’s cannabis-inspired product range is designed to make its users feel relaxed.It won’t give its users a particularly strong ‘high’.The main ingredient is CBD oil - a chemical compound that alters the way neurotransmitters in the brain work and respond.A company in north-east Switzerland, The Botanicals, manufactures and grows the cannabis plants indoors, in controlled greenhouses.Lidl said: “The manufacturer relies on sustainable agriculture and refrains entirely from adding chemical, synthetic or genetically modified substances.“The legally cultivable varieties contain only very small amounts of THC and a high proportion of CBD oil.”The change in the law in 2011 in Switzerland was designed to make medical cannabis more accessible throughout the country. A Swiss supermarket chain called Coop was the first to release a Cannabis-style product.Lidl are also selling 3g bags of the product, but it is made mainly from flowers that are grown in the same greenhouse."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403449580.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"doctors remove 9 stone tumour from woman who was left unable to eat by giant mass","story":"It took a team of 25 surgeons to remove the growth in one of the biggest tumour removals ever performed.The tumour, which grew at a rate of 10 pounds a week, was slowly crushing the 38-year-olds digestive tract.It took two weeks to plan the five-hour surgery due to the size of the mass and how close it was to almost all of her vital organs.The surgery was a success and the patient was discharged two weeks later, expected to make a full recovery.Rapid weight gain over a period of two months prompted to woman to seek medical help, which is when doctors discovered her benign mucinous ovarian tumour.A CT scan revealed the large mass and she was referred to Danbury Hospital in Connecticut for further treatment.Dr Vaagn Andikyan a gynecologic oncologist who treated the patient, said: I might expect to see a 25-pound ovarian tumour, but a 132-pound tumour is very rare.When I met the patient, she was extremely malnourished because the tumour was sitting on her digestive tract, and she used a wheelchair because of the tumours weight.Doctors are now carrying out genetic tests on the tumour to better understand why it grew so fast.They hope their research will develop better ways to treat future patients.Dr Linus Chuang, an oncologist at the hospital, said the case was extraordinarily complex.We were all determined to help our patient, even though this was the first time a case like this had come to Danbury Hospital, he added.Ovarian tumours are difficult to spot because their symptoms are often mistaken for less serious conditions, like period pain or indigestion.The patients type of tumour is a common type, accounting for about a third of ovarian tumours.The main difference between a mucinous tumour and another ovarian tumour is that these are often filled with mucus, which makes them very large and heavy.Most mucinous ovarian tumours are benign, meaning they are non-cancerous."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403458582.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cinco de mayo uk celebration mexican independence date","story":"The celebration is often thought to be commemorating Mexican independence, however it actually commemorates a battle.

Gordon, which vanished while travelling from Glasgow in Scotland to Australia in 1876, or the Magdala, voyaging from Wales to  Indonesia.“For the iron ship, the barques Kooringa (1894), Lake Ontario (1897) and West Ridge (1883) are possible, with the West Ridge best fitting the evidence,” said Mr Anderson.The hull structure of the wooden ship and other timbers appeared to have totally degraded, leaving only the remains of its coal cargo and metal objects such as fastenings, anchors and fittings.“The evidence points to the ship sinking as a result of a catastrophic event such as explosion, which was common in the transport of coal cargoes,” said Mr Anderson.One of the most interesting finds was a large rectangular metal object, 6m in length, which initially generated excitement as a possible treasure chest.But it was later found to be the metal ship’s iron water tank.The second wreck was more intact, lying upright on the seabed, with at least two decks and visible portholes at the stern.Dr Anderson said more work – and funding – is needed before his team can be certain over the identity of the wrecks.If it was a shipwreck that we could dive on ... wed be looking for any artefacts like ceramics or bottles or anything that could confirm providence, Dr Anderson added.These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean, theyre some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world, so we try to maximise any information.The wrecks of two other 20th century trawlers were also found, but the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, did not ask the museum carry out further research.When the sonar search first located the wreckage, it was briefly thought that the remnants of MH370 had been found.Hopes were dashed when high-resolution images showed that it was a ship rather than aircraft which had been discovered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
