I mean, Hilary Mantel doesn\u0027t dumb down in her novels. She doesn\u0027t write for 50-year-olds in Woking,\u0027 he said.His remarks angered residents of the Surrey town, who yesterday accused the BBC of \u0027patronising\u0027 and \u0027insulting\u0027 licence fee payers.Jonathan Lord, Woking\u0027s 56-year-old Tory MP, said: \u0027The intellectual snobbery of BBC bosses knows no bounds.           Residents of Woking (file image) say the BBC is \u0027patronising\u0027 and \u0027insulting\u0027 licence fee payers\u0027They just can\u0027t seem to keep their prejudices to themselves. If memory serves, Hilary Mantel was herself a 50-year-old in Woking when she wrote some of her most successful books, so this particular outburst seems peculiarly inept and inapt.\u0027Sheridan Smith transforms into Grindr serial killer victim\u0027s...When IS the right time to kick your ex off your Netflix...Share this articleDame Hilary Mantel, pictured in 2015 at Buckingham PalaceWith an artistic history including Martian invaders, afternoon TV favourite Countdown and the Nobel Prize for literature, Woking is no cultural wasteland.Wolf Hall author Dame Hilary Mantel has written about her love of going to the theatre there and attending lectures at the Surrey History Centre in the town when living in Knaphill on the outskirts.She said it gave her ‘the chance to see opera and ballet as well as plays, without going into London’.HG Wells’s move to Woking in 1895 aged 28 inspired some of his greatest works, including The War Of The Worlds, in which the suburb of Horsell Common is the location for the start the invasion of Earth by Mars.In his 18 months there he also wrote The Invisible Man, completed The Island Of Dr Moreau and published The Wheels Of Chance.Singer Paul Weller was born and raised in Woking. It was there that he formed his first band The Jam, which had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s including The Eton Rifles and Going Underground.Author Kazuo Ishiguro won a place at Woking County Grammar School after his parents moved from Japan. Ishiguro won the Booker Prize in 1989 for The Remains Of The Day, and the Nobel Prize for literature was in 2017.TV quiz Countdown’s ‘queen of Dictionary Corner’ Susie Dent was born in Woking. She went on to study at Oxford University before becoming the show’s resident lexicographer.                                                    \u0027I might not go to the opera every weekend or listen to every radio arts show but to say that a programme would have to be simplified for the likes of me to understand... it\u0027s incredibly insulting.\u0027 Web designer Ryan Thompson, 53, said: \u0027It is appalling. How dare he describe a group of people who live in a town full of arts and culture as not being cultured enough to understand arts programmes? We don\u0027t need anything to be \u0027dumbed down\u0027 for us.\u0027Samantha Coburn, 59, who moved back to the town four years ago after living in London, said: \u0027I listen to Radio 4 all the time and have no trouble understanding their programmes. Maybe if Mr Runcie bothered to visit Woking he\u0027d think twice before making comments.\u0027The BBC said Mr Runcie did not \u0027intend\u0027 to offend Woking residents. A spokesman said: \u0027James compared making high quality arts programmes for a wide audience to how Hilary Mantel writes for more than just those who might be expected to read historical fiction, referencing Woking residents in this context. Any other interpretation is not what James intended.\u0027Mr Runcie\u0027s comments come as the BBC faces pressure to serve a broad range of audiences, and not just the so-called \u0027metropolitan elite\u0027. The broadcaster has been warned by Ofcom that it must do more to cater to all licence fee payers, amid growing concerns that too many of its bosses are privileged Oxbridge graduates.Mr Runcie, whose father was the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, certainly falls into that category. He went to the renowned Dragon School in Oxford, then Marlborough College and Cambridge University.He now describes himself as a \u0027man of letters\u0027, iding his time between his job in charge of Radio 4\u0027s arts coverage – which he does only two days a week – and a parallel career as a novelist. He is best-known for his Grantchester books, about a clergyman detective, which have been dramatised on ITV.In the Feedback interview Mr Runcie said he \u0027cannot stand it when arts programmes sound like an Islington dinner party\u0027.          \u0027The Martian\u0027 by Michael Condron in Woking.

They have borrowed a total of £10.7billion from the taxpayer.But around one in ten families handed public money earn over £80,000 a year.The report also shows that around a fifth of borrowers - or 37,206 - were already on the property ladder and were not first-time buyers.Mr Mann said: \u0027Help to Buy is clearly not supporting the people it was intended for.

It is also introducing regional price caps.The MHCLG pointed out that the majority of households using Help to Buy - 111,347 or 57 per cent - had a total income of less than £50,000.Housing Minister Kit Malthouse said the scheme was \u0027helping to make the dream of home ownership a reality for a new generation\u0027.A spokesman for the Home Builders Federation said: \u0027Help to Buy has transformed the lives of thousands of people by enabling them to get onto the housing ladder.\u0027The scheme is delivering as intended by helping first time buyers, driving unprecedented increases in house building, creating jobs and boosting the economy.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"State schools ask parents donate hundreds pounds year help pay teachers repairs","story":"    Sir Thomas Rich\u0027s in Gloucester received £96,000 in parental donations last year and said it suffered £400,000 worth of cuts and cost increases in the academic year 2017-18School funding was debated in Parliament yesterday after a petition on budget cuts, started by headteachers, garnered more than 100,000 signatures.Growing numbers of schools are adopting a four-and-a-half-day week to save money, with one saying last week that it would charge parents for their children to stay in school on Friday afternoons. Heads say they are also having to clean school toilets, sweep floors and wash up.A survey of 700 schools via Freedom of Information requests found 200 had asked for parental donations in the past year. Furious Muslim parents withdraw children from school...Third of parents who hire tutors to help their children with...Share this articleThe poll, carried out by The Times, found about half of those asked for specific amounts.Some requested only payments for school trips, but many were now using donations and PTA fund-raising for classroom basics.Swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum but more than one in ten of those seeking donations asked parents to pay for lessons or transport.Others asked children to bring in their own stationery, glue sticks, exercise books and tissues. Many wanted cash for repairs and heating systems, with one needing a stairlift for a disabled pupil.The highest request, for £1,260 a year per family, came from Rosh Pinah, a Jewish primary in north London. Donations go towards running costs of the school, security and Jewish studies. Sir Thomas Rich’s, a grammar school in Gloucester, received £96,000 in parental donations last year, which it spent on building maintenance and staffing minority subjects.On its website, it appeals to alumni as well as parents, saying: ‘As you are no doubt aware, funding for schools is very tight and Sir Thomas Rich’s has been hard hit, with £400,000 worth of cuts and cost increases for the academic year 2017-18 alone.’ It aimed to raise £120,000 in that academic year and asked supporters to set up regular donations.A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We have protected the core schools budget overall in real terms since 2010, and put an additional £1.3billion into core schools funding across 2018-19 and 2019-20, over and above plans set out at the last spending review.’ But the Institute of Fiscal Studies said last year that total school spending per pupil in England fell by about eight per cent between 2009-10 and 2017-18."},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan hire traditional nanny birth child","story":"Hiring a nanny: That is the long-term plan by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as Kate, Duchess of Cambridge has done for all her three childrenThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex plan to hire a traditional nanny after the birth of their first child, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.Informed sources dismissed speculation that Meghan will recruit a doula, a non-medical assistant who provides support during pregnancy and the early days of motherhood, or opt for a New Age-style birth.And they say reports that Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland will move permanently to Britain from America to help bring up the child are also wide of the mark.Instead, the couple plan to be hands-on parents, and will bring in a nanny later this year ahead of a rumoured royal tour. The approach mirrors that adopted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children, George, five, Charlotte, three, and Louis, ten months.They later appointed Maria Borrallo, a graduate of the prestigious Norland College, when George was a few months old, although it is understood that Meghan may bring in a nanny when her child is younger than that.Last night Norland College declined to say if they had been approached by the couple.It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three children.

But a source said: ‘This is her first baby and there will be a certain degree of playing it by ear.’In January, Meghan became patron of the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the animal welfare charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get jobs.She will this week join a panel including singer Annie Lennox and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to mark International Women’s Day, where they will discus issues such as ‘access to education and limitations in employment’.Meanwhile, builders have been working feverishly to complete the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Home Park, Windsor. Harry and Meghan hope to move to the Grade II listed property from Kensington Palace within the next three weeks.The move may mean that Meghan chooses not to give birth at the Lindo Wing, the exclusive maternity ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Central London where the Duchess of Cambridge had her three children, but instead use a hospital ‘closer to home’.One option would be Frimley Park Hospital in Berkshire, which is about 15 miles from Windsor and where the Countess of Wessex had her children. It comes amid reports Meghan and Harry are considering raising their child \u0027gender neutral\u0027 – understood to mean they will not enforce any male or female stereotypes.        Gender neutral:  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be looking at bring up their child without gender stereotypes According to a source, who has known the Duchess for many years and was at her wedding: \u0027Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby.\u0027She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won\u0027t be imposing any stereotypes.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the couple could choose to forgo traditional blues and pinks to match the baby\u0027s gender.

But the Duke is still very much a traditionalist at heart. He has continued his passion for hunting and shooting despite Meghan\u0027s love for animals.And as a young boy, he was always running around Highgrove in military fatigues, climbing trees and playing toy soldiers with Prince William.Meghan has also revealed she played with dolls as a child.A spokesman for Kensington Palace last night said: \u0027The Duke and Duchess are extremely excited to welcome their first child in the spring.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Britain feels wrath Storm Freya Drivers told stay roads","story":"    A towering 60ft magnolia tree, that was able to withstand the ferocious gales of Storm Freya last night, comes into full bloom outside a property in Lilliput, Poole, Dorset           The spectacular tree is used to withstanding gale force winds and violent squalls and was able to battle the strong winds last night          The tree, which stands 60ft tall, is  protected by a tree preservation order and has to be pruned by a specialist arborist          The towering tree, which is believed to have been planted by a previous owner around 100 years ago, has come into full bloom despite the fierce winds last night          The tree\u0027s striking appearance comes after the UK recovers from the aftermath of Storm Freya last night, which saw gusts of up to 80mphGuy Barter, the chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u0027Some magnolias are tall and ideal for parks and botanic gardens while others are mere bushes and well suited to gardens.\u0027They are extremely hardy and reliable.

The project will create up to 20 new jobs with the profits being reinvested into charitable activities at the Dumfries House estate.The 18th century property, designed by the Adam brothers, was put up for sale by its former owner, the aristocrat and former F1 racing driver Johnny Dumfries.It opened to the public in the summer of 2008 following intensive restoration work.Princes Charles recently merged four of his charities focusing on culture, heritage, built environment and community education into one foundation based at Dumfries House.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeff Bezos camp tried send Hawaii marriage counselling retreat","story":"    Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie were urged to go to a week-long couple\u0027s therapy retreat in Hawaii when news of his affair emerged           Bezos was told to not see Lauren Sanchez, his mistress, for 30 days but the pair are still togetherHouse Democrats launch shock and awe probe into Trump...Share this articleMaui Intensives is a $12,500 retreat in Maui where therapists Judy Gabriel and Rae Ariel offer services for \u0027iniduals, couples and families\u0027. They pride themselves on their discretion and on the fact that they are \u0027word of mouth only\u0027. De Becker, who spearheaded an investigation into who leaked details of their affair, is quoted on its website heaping praise on the pair.\u0027Their innovative approach accomplishes in a week what typical 50-minute sessions take years to address.           The retreat is run by therapists Rae Ariel (left) and Judy Gabriel (right) and prides itself on its discretion \u0027The people I have referred to Rae and Judy have experienced profound value, clarity and healing.

It was there that he formed his first band The Jam, which had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s including The Eton Rifles and Going Underground.Author Kazuo Ishiguro won a place at Woking County Grammar School after his parents moved from Japan. Ishiguro won the Booker Prize in 1989 for The Remains Of The Day, and the Nobel Prize for literature was in 2017.TV quiz Countdown’s ‘queen of Dictionary Corner’ Susie Dent was born in Woking.

Any other interpretation is not what James intended.\u0027Mr Runcie\u0027s comments come as the BBC faces pressure to serve a broad range of audiences, and not just the so-called \u0027metropolitan elite\u0027. The broadcaster has been warned by Ofcom that it must do more to cater to all licence fee payers, amid growing concerns that too many of its bosses are privileged Oxbridge graduates.Mr Runcie, whose father was the Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, certainly falls into that category.

Our first freedom is democratic freedom: the freedom to choose our leaders as foreign powers seek to influence our vote at each election. I propose creating a European Agency for the Protection of Democracies, which will provide each Member State with European experts to protect their election process against cyber attacks and manipulation. In this same spirit of independence, we should also ban the funding of European political parties by foreign powers. We should have European rules banish all incitements to hate and violence from the Internet, since respect for the inidual is the bedrock of our civilisation of dignity.Founded on internal reconciliation, the European Union has forgotten to look at the realities of the world. Yet no community can create a sense of belonging if it does not have bounds that it protects. The boundary is freedom in security. We therefore need to rethink the Schengen area: all those who want to be part of it should comply with obligations of responsibility (stringent border controls) and solidarity (one asylum policy with the same acceptance and refusal rules). We will need a common border force and a European asylum office, strict control obligations and European solidarity to which each country will contribute under the authority of a European Council for Internal Security. On the issue of migration, I believe in a Europe that protects both its values and its borders.The same standards should apply to defence. Substantial progress has been made in the last two years, but we need to set a clear course: a treaty on defence and security should define our fundamental obligations in association with NATO and our European allies: increased defence spending, a truly operational mutual defence clause, and the European Security Council with the United Kingdom on board to prepare our collective decisions.Our borders also need to guarantee fair competition. What power in the world would accept continued trade with those who respect none of their rules? We cannot suffer in silence. We need to reform our competition policy and reshape our trade policy with penalties or a ban in Europe on businesses that compromise our strategic interests and fundamental values such as environmental standards, data protection and fair payment of taxes and the adoption of European preference in strategic industries and our public procurement, as our American and Chinese competitors do.Europe is not a second-rank power. Europe in its entirety is a vanguard: it has always defined the standards of progress. In this, it needs to drive forward a project of convergence rather than competition: Europe, where social security was created, needs to introduce a social shield for all workers, east to west and north to south, guaranteeing the same pay in the same workplace, and a minimum European wage appropriate to each country and discussed collectively every year.Getting back on track with progress also concerns spearheading the ecological cause. Will we be able to look our children in the eye if we do not also clear our climate debt? The European Union needs to set its target – zero carbon by 2050 and pesticides halved by 2025 – and adapt its policies accordingly with such measures as a European Climate Bank to finance the ecological transition, a European food safety force to improve our food controls and, to counter the lobby threat, independent scientific assessment of substances hazardous to the environment and health. This imperative needs to guide all our action: from the Central Bank to the European Commission, from the European budget to the Investment Plan for Europe, all our institutions need to have the climate as their mandate.          Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May at a summit in Canada in June 2018 Progress and freedom are about being able to live from your work: Europe needs to look ahead to create jobs. This is why it needs not only to regulate the digital giants by putting in place European supervision of the major platforms (prompt penalties for unfair competition, transparent algorithms, etc.), but also to finance innovation by giving the new European Innovation Council a budget on a par with the United States in order to spearhead new technological breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence.A world-oriented Europe needs to look towards Africa, with which we should enter into a covenant for the future, taking the same road and ambitiously and non-defensively supporting African development with such measures as investment, academic partnerships and education for girls.Freedom, protection and progress. We need to build European renewal on these pillars. We cannot let nationalists without solutions exploit the people\u0027s anger. We cannot sleepwalk through a diminished Europe. We cannot become ensconced in business as usual and wishful thinking. European humanism demands action. And everywhere, the people are standing up to be part of that change. So by the end of the year, let\u0027s set up, with the representatives of the European institutions and the Member States, a Conference for Europe in order to propose all the changes our political project needs, with an open mind, even to amending the treaties. This conference will need to engage with citizens\u0027 panels and hear academics, business and labour representatives, and religious and spiritual leaders. It will define a roadmap for the European Union that translates these key priorities into concrete actions. There will be disagreement, but is it better to have a static Europe or a Europe that advances, sometimes at different paces, and that is open to all?In this Europe, the peoples will really take back control of their future. In this Europe, the United Kingdom, I am sure, will find its true place.Citizens of Europe, the Brexit impasse is a lesson for us all. We need to escape this trap and make the upcoming elections and our project meaningful. It is for you to decide whether Europe and the values of progress that it embodies are to be more than just a passing episode in history. This is the choice I propose: to chart together the road to European renewal.Emmanuel Macron                         "},{"url":null,"title":"Second man free AIDS virus transplant","story":"    \u0027Berlin Patient\u0027 Timothy Ray Brown was successfully cured of the HIV virus 12 years agoThe latest case \u0027shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a fluke and can be recreated,\u0027 said Dr. Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who had no role. He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely.The case was published online Monday by the journal Nature and will be presented at an HIV conference in Seattle.The patient has not been identified. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and started taking drugs to control the infection in 2012. It\u0027s unclear why he waited that long. He developed Hodgkin lymphoma that year and agreed to a stem cell transplant to treat the cancer in 2016.With the right kind of donor, his doctors figured, the London patient might get a bonus beyond treating his cancer: a possible HIV cure.

About 1 percent of people descended from northern Europeans have inherited the mutation from both parents and are immune to most HIV.

Photograph: Eric LukeOwners of almost 900 apartments in south Dublin say they are being shut out of a €750-million Government scheme which had been billed as a potential lifeline for owners of apartments facing fire-safety defects.The owners of the apartments at Beacon South Quarter in Dublin, which was found to have fire safety issues that will cost more than €10 million to fix, had hoped to apply for a loan from the Government’s new Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) fund.She said the company also now believed HBFI financing was prohibitively expensive. Ms Cottier said the cost of the loans, which would attract an interest rate of up to 8 per cent, would prove prohibitive.At 8 per cent, she said, a HBFI loan would cost apartment owners an additional €200,000. She also said the fund did not appear to be interested in lending for remediation works.Contrary to indicationThis, Ms Cottier said, was contrary to indications given by policymakers and Ministers last year.In response to a Dáil question in December, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe told Fine Gael TD for Clare Joe Carey that HBFI would be in a position to consider applications for works on latent defects in January of this year. Mr Carey later issued a press release stating the fund could be used to pay for remediation works at projects affected by issues in his constituency.However, it is understood there are significant misgivings within HBFI about giving loans for remediation works. Sources said the fund had indicated it had concerns about lending for remediation projects due to the risk of costs outstripping budgets, the lack of security for the loan –as owners’ management companies generally have no assets – and the possibility of raising State aid issues.New unitsA spokesman for HBFI emphasised that the fund was focusing on lending for new units. He said the fund will provide loans to builders subject to certain terms and conditions, including the size of the new development and the planning status of a project.“Applications that do not meet these terms and conditions are unlikely to meet State aid rules or be commercially viable.”As a result, the Beacon apartment owners have now decided against applying for the loan.The management company expressed dismay that a HBFI loan was now out of its reach, as it had been their main hope for financing remediation works."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3736810.1545223813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"do you know of a building with serious defects tell us about it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFire safety issues like those seen in St James’s Wood are common in many apartment buildings built during the boom.

He indirectly accuses Brexiteers of irresponsibility and lying.  Photograph: Caroline BlumbergAFPGetty An urgent appeal for the people of Europe to mobilse for “the values of progress” and against “nationalists without solutions” has been issued by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.In an unprecedented open letter published in Ireland by The  and by newspapers in the other 27 EU member states, including Britain, Mr Macron says that two traps threaten Europe today – the trap of “nationalist retrenchment” and “the trap of the status quo and resignation”.The French president chose this moment to issue his appeal, an aide said, because the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union in three weeks and elections to the European Parliament take place in May.Brexit “symbolises the crisis of Europe”, Mr Macron argues in his letter. He indirectly accuses Brexiteers of irresponsibility and lying.“Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future?,” he asks. “Who spoke to them about losing access to the European market? Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the former border? Nationalist retrenchment offers nothing it is rejection without an alternative.”The EU has been a historic success, Mr Macron says. Collective sovereignty is real the isolationist sovereignty of the nationalists is an illusion. Only the EU can face up to aggressive policies on the part of China, Russia and the US. Only the EU can contain the power of the internet giants. The euro strengthened Europe in the last financial crisis, he says.Mr Macron recognises that the EU “has become a soulless market” in the eyes of many citizens. He wants them to see Europe as “borders that protect and values that unite”. Withdrawing from Europe does not defend identity, he says. “It is the European civilisation that unites, frees and protects us.”The present is “a pivotal moment ... the moment for European renewal,” Mr Macron writes, calling on Europe to renew itself around the three ambitions of freedom, protection and progress.The 2016 presidential campaign in the US and the French presidential campaign in 2017 were marked by accusations of Russian interference. Mr Macron proposes a European agency for the protection of democracies to prevent cyber attacks and manipulation. He would also ban foreign powers from funding European political parties, and ban all incitements to hatred and violence on the internet.Social shieldMr Macron addresses concerns about the influx of migrants in Europe by proposing a “rethink” of the Schengen area. Ireland does not belong to the Schengen zone, but those who do must guarantee stringent border controls and adopt a single asylum policy with the same acceptance and refusal rules, he says. He calls for a common border force, a European asylum office and a European council for internal security.Without naming China, Mr Macron says the EU must no longer “suffer in silence” from unfair competition. He advocates penalties or a ban on companies “that compromise our strategic interests and fundamental values” and proposes a “European preference” in strategic industries and public procurement, similar to what is practised in China and the US.Doubtless influenced by his experience of the revolt of the yellow vests or ‘gilets jaunes’, Mr Macron says that European social policies must converge, not compete with each other. He wants a “social shield” for all workers in the EU, which would guarantee the same pay in the same workplace and “a minimum European wage appropriate to each country and discussed collectively each year”.Mr Macron wants member states to hold a conference that would engage with citizens’ panels. An adviser said the French president had been impressed by the efficacy of the Citizens’ Assembly in addressing fundamental questions in Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3814235.1551729019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit pessimism in london about prospects of crucial vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Theresa May leaves a hair salon during a visit to Salisbury. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaPoolEPABritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay return to Brussels on Tuesday amid deepening pessimism at Westminster about the prospects of a crucial Brexit vote next week.Mr Cox sought on Monday to play down a report that he is no longer seeking a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the Northern Ireland backstop.The attorney general described the Daily  report as “misunderstood fag ends dressed up as facts” but stopped short of denying it.\u0026nbsp“Some of it is accurate, much more of it isn’t and what is not is far more significant than what is. Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public,” he said.Downing Street also declined to give details of the negotiations but said the attorney general “continues to pursue legally binding changes to the backstop” to ensure it cannot be indefinite.The EU has ruled out a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism or any change to the text of what the withdrawal agreement says about the backstop – the guarantee there will be no hard border in Ireland after Brexit.Negotiations have focused instead on review clauses and an arbitration mechanism to determine when the conditions have been met for the backstop to end.The prime minister is hoping Mr Cox will secure enough from the EU to allow him to change his legal advice that Britain could be kept in the backstop indefinitely.Panel of lawyersThe European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers has established a panel of eight lawyers, including DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, to evaluate any new text Mr Cox negotiates.Mr Dodds made clear this week that further assurances about the temporary nature of the backstop will not be enough to win his support for the Brexit deal.“We know the current backstop arrangements are meant to be temporary and all the assurances in the world from the EU that they will negotiate in good faith etc – it doesn’t change that. What we need to have is legally binding change, not assurances about what we know already,” he told the BBC.Mr Dodds said he was less concerned about the legal form of any change than that it should have legal effect and “changes the current meaning” of the withdrawal agreement and makes it clear that it cannot be indefinite.Long extensionMartin Howe, another of the lawyers on the Brexiteer panel, said on Monday that a long extension of the article 50 negotiating period would be preferable to a short extension or approving Mrs May’s deal.Writing for the Conservative Home website, Mr Howe said a three-month extension would make no practical difference but a 21-month extension would mean that the UK would continue to have a say in EU institutions rather than simply accepting EU rules during a transition period and avoid triggering the backstop.“The article 50 extension would give us more time to do what May’s government should have been doing all along during the 2½ years since the referendum. That is to prepare overtly, steadily and determinedly for a no-deal exit as a twin-track alongside negotiating with the EU.“This would strengthen our negotiating position, and with May’s deal in the bin we could actually press for a deal which genuinely protects our ability to forge an independent trade policy and also deals with the Northern Ireland Border issue by alternative means,” he wrote.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted that Ireland has been “very flexible and reasonable” in helping the UK to deal with problems “largely of their own creation” in the Brexit process.He said he was “happy to offer further clarifications and assurances” to help the EU and UK negotiators get a deal done, with the planned departure date of March 29th looming.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill‘I never wanted to be part of the German empire’For some living in Britain today, applying for an Irish passport is an expression of resistance to Brexit or a reawakening of a long-dormant connection to Ireland. For others it is nothing more than a desire to get through airport security more quickly.Tony Flemming, a Manchester native whose mother came from Athlone, voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. He applied for Irish citizenship last year.“I want to go on holiday to Europe, and it would be easier with an Irish passport,” Flemming (73) says. “And the second reason I got it was just to see if I could.“I will use my Irish passport on the journey out and then switch to my British passport when returning home, so it’s quicker through security.”Despite being the new owner of a European travel document, Flemming said he “never wanted to be part of the ‘German empire’.”He added, “I’ve been hoping for Brexit for a long time. I just want to get out and get it sorted.”His children voted to remain in the EU.“My children have said I’m hypocritical,” said Flemming. “I think it’s perfectly normal to take advantage of a system if the option is there.”He was once a regular visitor to Ireland, but the last trip was during the 1966 World Cup. However, his dual citizenship is intended for sunnier travels.“I like to go to Gibraltar, so my British passport will be fine until I walk over to Spain, and then I’ll use my Irish one.”Flemming is not alone. Last year the passport service received 200,000 applications from British-based people directly to Dublin or through its office in London – although the largest share are for the children of Irish-born citizens living in Britain.‘This has opened up my Irish roots’Jim Greer (56), a social work lecturer from Scotland, spent €250 accumulating his grandmother’s birth, marriage and death certificates and a further €278 on an application for Irish citizenship.“Ireland was the only EU country I was eligible to apply for. I didn’t actually realise I was eligible until Brexit happened,” he says.Living in Scotland, where 62 per cent of residents voted to remain, Greer pursued Irish citizenship as a “symbol of resistance to Brexit”.“It is just not my outlook at all,” he says. “It feels less like we’re being dragged out of the EU as we’re being dragged into some English flag-waving, spitfire era.His paternal grandmother grew up in Ballymena, Co Antrim, before moving across to the west coast of Scotland.“She was actually a very staunch Protestant, so she would be turning in her grave right now,” says Greer, who visited Northern Ireland many times in his youth but has yet to set foot in the Republic.He spent six months learning about the country, listening to the Irish Passport Podcast, a series to educate aspiring Irish citizens on the country’s culture, history and politics.“I’ve found a new dimension. I always thought of myself as Scottish, but this has opened up my Irish roots. I might even consider living there.”‘Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now’Londoners Rachel and Bill Bohling got their Irish passports at the same time as their mother, Cathy, who grew up in Co Tyrone.“We were quite delayed as a family in getting them, as we’ve been entitled to one all our lives,” says Rachel (26). “Our mum was very emotionally involved. She was pushing us to get them ever since Brexit.”With her boyfriend living in Paris, Rachel’s new passport gave her the confidence to look into transferring offices to France.“Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now. I don’t think it can impact me the way it could before.”While Bill (31) has no immediate plans, having an Irish passport keeps the door to Europe open.“I personally love being European and having that option to travel,” he said.He speaks fondly about family trips to Ireland, where they visited relatives north and south of the Border.“I’ve always felt very appreciative of my mum’s heritage. That Irish root is very important to me. I’m a proud British and Irish citizen.”‘My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now’Self-confessed pessimist Matthew Modlinsky (44) applied for an Irish passport just two weeks after the Brexit referendum.“I like to be prepared for the worst,” says Modlinsky, a transport co-ordinator. “I’m even stocking up on food now: cans of chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, nothing perishable.”His mother moved from Monaghan to Manchester when she was 16.“It’s just pure luck that my mum is Irish. I see other people who feel the same as me who aren’t as lucky.”His mother goes back each year to see family, but Modlinsky has visited the island just once.“My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now. I know that’s terrible. Now that I’m an Irish citizen I should go more. I do plan to go.”A keen traveller, he hopes his new passport will make European trips easy. In the long-term, he plans to retire to France or Spain.“I don’t want to be restricted in what I do. That’s the travesty of it all. It’s not my generation, it’s the younger generation who are having an opportunity taken away from them.”‘I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long’Although Amy McCollam (40) only applied for her passport last year, she began researching Irish citizenship long before Brexit.“Ireland is a big part of me it’s home. I did all my important growing up there,” she said.When she was 13 her family moved to Ballymena, her father’s hometown. She lived there for seven years, before returning to England to study.Now, McCollam lives in Reading and is applying for Irish citizenship for her daughter, Keira, through foreign birth registration.“I want her to understand part of where she comes from,” said McCollam. “I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long and I love it, so I want her to have it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

named Absher - has been downloaded more than a million times in Saudi ArabiaGoogle is refusing to remove a Saudi government app that allows men to track and control women.The app, which gives men the power to grant and rescind travel permission for women and to set up SMS alerts for when they use their passports, will remain available to buy.Google said it had reviewed the app — called Absher — and concluded that it did not violate any agreements, and could therefore remain on its Google Play store.The app, which is owned and operated by the kingdom’s interior ministry, also has features that send alerts if a woman leaves a certain area - making it difficult for women to leave without the say so of a “male ”.Women in the ultra-conservative kingdom must by law have male s, whether it be a husband, father, brother or uncle, who gives permission for them to do everything including studying, marrying, renting a house, and travelling.Google and Apple’s decision to host the app, which has been downloaded more than one million times, has drawn complaints, including from Human Rights Watch which said the tech companies were “facilitating human rights abuses”.Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman took back her passport and fled her family More than a dozen members of US Congress wrote to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook on February 21, demanding that the app be removed.They described Google, as well as Apple, as accomplices in the oppression of Saudi Arabian women for hosting the app.They gave a deadline of Thursday 28 February to explain why the app is hosted on Google Play.Ilhan Omar, Democrat Rep, one of the signatories, tweeted: “Women are not your property! Women are not your property! Women are not your property! So why are @Apple and @Google hosting an app that allows men to track and control women’s movement in Saudi Arabia? This insanity needs to end!”The subject of Saudi women’s right to travel was highlighted last month after an 18-year-old Saudi woman fled her family over alleged abuse.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun said she took her passport while on holiday in Kuwait and travelled to Thailand hoping to claim asylum.Please review our commenting policyTesting everyone for HIV leads to drop in infection by a thirdNew funding models for health urgently needed, experts warnCross-dressing Royal Ascot-goers given free rein to experiment as course relaxes gender rulesHealth of Scotland\u0026#39s children at risk because of a shortage of paediatric consultants, warns reportCouncil tax to jump by 4.5 per cent in 20120 -

He can be seen playing with her hair. A third man can be heard behind the camera directing the video. With the camera recording, Sir Philip says he is very upset the unnamed employee is leaving us adding that somehow we\u0027ll manage, as he pulls the woman known as Naughty closer to him. Sir Philip then says: So Naughty is now going to look after me instead of you, before audibly kissing her on the cheek three times.Having filmed the piece to camera, the woman stands up and sits on the arm of the sofa with the tape still rolling.Sir Philip then gestures for her to sit back down next to him before the interviewer behind the camera asks what the former employee was like to work with. Sir Philip responds: In the meanwhile, I\u0027ve got Naughty. Lucky me, as he shuffles along the sofa towards her and puts his arm around her before pulling back and rubbing her cheek with the back of his finger. An investigation by The  into Sir Philip revealed him to be the businessman at the heart of sexual and racial harassment claims.Sir Philip paid a female executive more than £1 million as part of a settlement agreement after she accused the retail tycoon of groping her in a series of allegations that were only disclosed after a six-month legal battle.He is also alleged to have racially abused a senior black employee, telling him that his “problem” was that he was still throwing spears in the jungle.The black member of staff received around £1 million, while two other female employees were paid hundreds of thousands of pounds each after complaining of Sir Philip’s “inappropriate” behaviour that included “grabbing” one woman by the face and putting another in a “headlock”.Five complainants each signed a gagging clause  – known as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) – in return for the pay-offs.The  was able to make public for the first time details of the allegations after the High Court action brought by the billionaire against this newspaper was formally abandoned.Testing everyone for HIV leads to drop in infection by a thirdNew funding models for health urgently needed, experts warnCross-dressing Royal Ascot-goers given free rein to experiment as course relaxes gender rulesHealth of Scotland\u0026#39s children at risk because of a shortage of paediatric consultants, warns reportCouncil tax to jump by 4.5 per cent in 20120 - the second biggest increase in a decade, Cipfa saysBritain needs to rethink \u0026#39Mrs Robinson mindset\u0026#39 that tolerates women grooming boys, says charityA cup of cocoa a day could reduce fatigue in MS sufferers, research suggestsSporty women are likely to notch up more sexual partners   First TV campaign to urge women to undergo cervical smear tests as screening uptake hits record low Police leader calls for nationwide return of stop and search powers to combat knife crime crisisTories praise Tony Benn\u0026#39s financial planning as donation of his archive knocks £210,000 off family\u0026#39s tax billTwitter, Google and Facebook agree to rapid \u0026#39takedown\u0026#39 system to remove posts which threaten to collapse trialsComment: If the Conservatives aren’t careful, their next leader could be their lastTheresa May warned she must whip MPs to stop them taking no-deal Brexit off the tableDisabled pensioners will no longer have to undergo repeat benefit assessments, Amber Rudd to sayDrivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police officers call for emergency stop and search powers to stem knife crime epidemicSteiner school teacher who said he was being \u0026#39grandfatherly\u0026#39 when he allowed children to sit in his lap is struck offComment: Why, ten years after my brother\u0026#39s death, the knife crisis still hasn\u0026#39t been dealt withBanks must keep paper billing for 5 million people who don\u0026#39t use the internet, ONS saysEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39minimum European wage\u0026#39 as he says Brexit presents a \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 to EUWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/beauty/2019/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000006518209_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"virgin airlines tells air hostesses dont need wear make","story":"THEY should weigh no more than eight stone, be younger than 26, and display the bloom that goes with perfect health, said a New York Times article in 1936.But times have changed and now air hostesses are being freed from rigid beauty standards, as high heels, compulsory skirts, and now make up are no longer part of their compulsory dress codes. In just the latest sign that the traditional trolley dolly is dead, Virgin Atlantic has become the first premier airline to tell female cabin crew that they will no longer have to wear makeup in the air.  It will also provide female crew with trousers as part of their standard uniform to wear instead of a skirt. Until now trousers have only been available if female staff specially request them.The move will by seen by many as going some way towards addressing a gaping gender equality problem within the aviation industry, which s everything from uniform to pay and workers\u0027 rights. Sir Richard Branson waves farewell prior to his flight to Kuala Lumpur at Perth International AirportJust last week this newspaper revealed that British Airways “gagged” a group of female pilots to stop them telling MPs about poor maternity policies at work.It comes five years after the airline’s uniform policy made the news after Virgin boss Richard Branson dressed in cabin crew uniform – complete with red lipstick – after losing a bet.It follows British Airways\u0027 decision back in 2016 to allow female flight attendants to wear trousers.  However airlines generally require flight attendants to have a “groomed look that meets conventional standard”, and BA is no exception.BA\u0027s latest staff handbook states: “For women, you will need to have a styled look with hair and makeup that would be appropriate in a professional environment and complements our uniform.Air hostesses in training are taught in a mock-up of an aircraft cabin at London Airport in 1958For men, your hair must meet a conventional style which is appropriate for a professional environment, shaven or sculptured styles and long hair are not permitted. Dyed hair must be of a natural colour for both men and women.”Some airlines are reported to have gone even further by having specific guidelines for tiny details of the physical appearance of their cabin crew. For example American Airlines is said to advise that: Noticeable hair in nostrils and inon ears or underarms must be cut or otherwise removed”.  Meanwhile Hawaiian Airlines is reported to advise that: “Hands and nails should be kept well groomed at all times, with nail length not exceeding an eighth of an inch beyond the finger tip. A spokesman at Virgin said: Our world-famous red uniform is something all of us at Virgin Atlantic are incredibly proud of. We want our uniform to truly reflect who we are as iniduals while maintaining that famous Virgin Atlantic style.Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on they want to express themselves at work.Testing everyone for HIV leads to drop in infection by a thirdNew funding models for health urgently needed, experts warnCross-dressing Royal Ascot-goers given free rein to experiment as course relaxes gender rulesHealth of Scotland\u0026#39s children at risk because of a shortage of paediatric consultants, warns reportCouncil tax to jump by 4.5 per cent in 20120 - the second biggest increase in a decade, Cipfa saysBritain needs to rethink \u0026#39Mrs Robinson mindset\u0026#39 that tolerates women grooming boys, says charityA cup of cocoa a day could reduce fatigue in MS sufferers, research suggestsSporty women are likely to notch up more sexual partners   First TV campaign to urge women to undergo cervical smear tests as screening uptake hits record low Police leader calls for nationwide return of stop and search powers to combat knife crime crisisTories praise Tony Benn\u0026#39s financial planning as donation of his archive knocks £210,000 off family\u0026#39s tax billTwitter, Google and Facebook agree to rapid \u0026#39takedown\u0026#39 system to remove posts which threaten to collapse trialsComment: If the Conservatives aren’t careful, their next leader could be their lastTheresa May warned she must whip MPs to stop them taking no-deal Brexit off the tableDisabled pensioners will no longer have to undergo repeat benefit assessments, Amber Rudd to sayDrivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police officers call for emergency stop and search powers to stem knife crime epidemicSteiner school teacher who said he was being \u0026#39grandfatherly\u0026#39 when he allowed children to sit in his lap is struck offComment: Why, ten years after my brother\u0026#39s death, the knife crisis still hasn\u0026#39t been dealt withBanks must keep paper billing for 5 million people who don\u0026#39t use the internet, ONS saysEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39minimum European wage\u0026#39 as he says Brexit presents a \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 to EUWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000177632343_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqf42Cjm-ISYYBtN6me_kDQhEq0ukJBAYOMG89gizXvuY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cross dressing royal ascot goers given free rein experiment","story":"Cara Delevigne appeared to breach the dress code at Princess Eugenie’s wedding by arriving in a tuxedoIt is the dilemma facing hundreds of well-heeled racegoers ahead of Royal Ascot.

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateSeveral studies have highlighted that young people are no longer as motivated by money as they used to be, and are increasingly prioritising a sense of purpose over pay. Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

In response, we are seeing heroic innovations, tantalising technologies and corporate sustainability going mainstream. But too often these approaches are geared towards temporary relief and don\u0027t address the root cause of the problem. We believe the answer lies in embracing systems change.\u0026nbspA system is simply a configuration of parts geared towards an outcome. A system can be as small as a beehive or as large as the NHS. At Forum for the Future, we see that the greatest challenges arise from our global systems being fundamentally broken: a food system that undermines the ecosystems upon which it relies, an economy which maximises short-term growth over long term viability, or an energy system fuelling runaway emissions and climate breakdown. System change means reinventing the rules of the game, creating new ways of organising and building refreshed, resilient systems.What then does this mean in practice? A crucial first step is a proper diagnosis of the problem at hand, something we explore with seven megatrends in our report, ‘The Future of Sustainability: Driving Systems Change in Turbulent Times’.Created with Sketch.

What we see above the surface, at the tip of the iceberg, are the visible events around us – a mother seagull trying to feed plastic to her chick, for example.A little below the surface, these events join up into patterns and trends. Plastic turning up in the stomachs of hundreds of marine species, for example. Deeper still are the systems and structures which allow these patterns to emerge such as cheap plastic, poor recycling infrastructure, a throwaway economy, lack of incentives.\u0026nbspFinally at the iceberg’s base, far below the surface\u0026nbspare our deeply held belief systems, values and mindsets: convenience, disconnection from nature, consumerism and many more. Each level creates the conditions for the layer above to emerge. Recognising the deep drivers of a challenge helps you diagnose where change is needed for long-lasting effect - the deeper, the better.\u0026nbspGetting to the root cause also reveals how global challenges are messy and rarely act in isolation. Climate change, for example, is deeply interwoven with loss of bioersity, which is needed for a high-yield food system and is driven by short-term thinking and demand for convenience. Rising nationalism is intermeshed with increasing digital connection and the spread of misinformation, built on deeply held fears of being left behind, and the need for belonging and for security. \u0026nbspSo, what can we do?\u0026nbspThere are no silver-bullet solutions. Addressing global challenges requires joined-up action from a whole suite of actors – from iniduals to governments to non-profits.In particular, the corporate sector urgently needs to move beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) towards understanding the power it has\u0026nbspto reconfigure systems that it is\u0026nbsppart of.Citarum River in Bandung, Indonesia. According to reports, Citarum is one of the most polluted rivers in the world, with tons of plastic waste and wastewater (EPA)A great example of this is Sky and its role in raising awareness around ocean plastics. The company\u0026nbspquickly moved beyond standard CSR, recognising the power of its broadcasting reach, giving rise to the documentary ‘A Plastic Ocean’, the Ocean Rescue and Sky Ocean Ventures – true corporate activists.Or another long-term partner of ours, Unilever, who, seeing that frequent financial reporting caused short-term thinking, stopped quarterly reporting. This small structural change is enabling the long-term investment required for more sustainable approaches and demonstrating that shareholders can be persuaded to get behind\u0026nbspideas when they are convinced they\u0026nbspwill generate long-term value.\u0026nbspBoth companies are contributing to a wider process of system change\u0026nbspSky by highlighting the root causes of the plastics problem, Unilever by shifting, however minutely, the rules of the game for business.\u0026nbspOf course, enlightened self-interest comes into play here. These leaders recognise that putting their faith in current, broken systems will ultimately spell the end of their businesses as they run out of resources and their supply chains are fractured by climate change.But they are also helping to create the conditions for the emergence of a new version of capitalism. One that is regenerative – giving back more than it takes from people and planet – and that fully appreciates the fallacy of infinite growth on a finite planet.\u0026nbspIt is only through fixing our broken systems, rather than applying sticking-plaster\u0026nbspsolutions, that we can inch back from the brink of a climate crisis. By looking to the future, re-imagining our systems, understanding how they can be different, we can reinvent the way the world works.This is what will make the difference between climate apocalypse and a bright new future. And it is within our grasp, but only just.Dr Sally Uren OBE is chief executive at Forum for the Future, a leading international non-profit tackling complex global challenges by catalysing change in key systems.

Lawyers allege that Huawei’s chief financial officer was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.The US lawsuit will filed in the Eastern District of Texas where Huawei has its American headquarters, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.According to one of the people, the lawsuit is likely to challenge a US law passed last year blocking government agencies from using Huawei’s telecoms equipment.The newspaper reported that Huawei will argue that the provision is unconstitutional because it amounts to a “bill of attainder,” or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The SpaceX team in Hawthorne watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space Station\u0027s Harmony module.

She added: “It is shocking how much of our own salary is spent on classroom resources.”And one teacher in Lincoln said schools were “dirty” because they could not afford proper cleaning and cuts have meant schools are barely able to afford photocopying.School spending per pupil has fallen by 8 per cent in real terms since 2010 amid increased cost pressures, according to the latest\u0026nbspanalysis from the Institute for\u0026nbspFiscal Studies (IFS).School governors call on government to urgently increase fundingThe online petition, started by headteachers in Gateshead, says: “All schools are working very hard to ‘make ends meet’ but this is becoming increasingly difficult and verging on almost impossible.”It adds parents are being increasingly asked to pay for books and materials due to a squeeze on budgets,\u0026nbspand schools are having to cut teachers, subjects and support for vulnerable pupils – including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).It came as three families who are challenging the government’s funding policy for children with SEND have been told their challenge will be heard in the High Court in June this year.Mary\u0026nbspBousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, called the funding cuts to schools and colleges “entirely unacceptable”, adding that the “real losers” were the children and young people.She added: “Education is one of the most important things a government can provide for its citizens, and currently it is failing miserably in its duty.”In response to the petition, the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We recognise schools are facing budgeting challenges and we are asking them to do more. We have increased funding by an extra £1.3bn across this year and next, over and above previous spending plans.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It will roll out to everyone as normal – with a change in the settings that will do the same job as the crescent moon –\u0026nbspin the coming weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Lawyers allege that Huawei’s chief financial officer was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.The US lawsuit will filed in the Eastern District of Texas where Huawei has its American headquarters, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.According to one of the people, the lawsuit is likely to challenge a US law passed last year blocking government agencies from using Huawei’s telecoms equipment.The newspaper reported that Huawei will argue that the provision is unconstitutional because it amounts to a “bill of attainder,” or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The SpaceX team in Hawthorne watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space Station\u0027s Harmony module.

The company\u0027s equipment could be used for Chinese government spying operations, US officials have said.The company’s executives have strongly rejected the allegations which they say are motivated by political and economic concerns.However, a number of governments including Australia and New Zealand have since banned\u0026nbspHuawei\u0027s equipment from the next generation of mobile networks.In a blow to US efforts, UK security bosses said last month that risks posed by Huawei\u0027s involvement in 5G networks can be contained.Huawei declined to comment on the NYT report.A hearing is set to begin this week in Canada that will determine whether Ms Meng will be extradited to the US to face charges. Ms Meng was arrested in Vancouver in December at the request of the US, which argued she posed a threat to national security. Huawei\u0027s CFO was charged with bank and wire fraud which she allegedly committed to circumvent American sanctions against Iran.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He told me he had once picked up a distressed woman from a nightclub, late at night, and she told him she had just been sexually assaulted by a north African immigrant.After taking a few moments to digest this, I asked the obvious question: “But what’s that got to do with Brexit?” He had barely begun answering before he accidentally drove through a red light, triggering a camera flash. This was going to cost him.\u0026nbspFor an Australian, getting to understand Brexit has been a process of getting to understand the English. I had a slight advantage on some of my compatriots. I was born in England, though my family moved to seek sun, sand and work after the winter of discontent in 1978-79 when I was a child.\u0026nbspI retain enough Englishness (and English relatives) to appreciate the lingering distrust of the continent and its people, the instinctive rejection of the post-war plan for all Europe to join in an ode to joy and brotherhood.

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fans of trade deals. As a self-aware “middle power”, we know that we prosper through alliances. We have few empire romances to fall back on (though we have the Commonwealth\u0026nbspmore of that later). We instinctively seek to draw ourselves closer to our neighbours, friends and trading partners through deals and forums.\u0026nbspFarage (AFPGetty)The sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surprise.From the start there was an immediate interest from our readers – reflected in the below-the-article arguments and in article click-throughs. I soon found myself writing seemingly endless updates, analysis pieces and weekend news reads on this technical, political spasm on the other side of the world.In the pre-Trump era Brexit was the international focus for a global trend: the rise of nationalism, the disillusionment with globalism, the fear of “uncontrolled”\u0026nbspmigration.\u0026nbspThese factors have been playing out in Australia too, though with different timing and emphasis.\u0026nbspWe managed to make it through the financial crisis more or less unscathed, so the economic triggers for Brexit were alien to us, or at least less relatable.As tensions rise with China, Brexit seems more dangerous than ever Australian salaries are high and public services pretty robust. But our housing availabilityaffordability bubble is as bad as Britain’s, with similar knock-on effects for quality of life.\u0026nbspOur migration “crisis”\u0026nbspcame in 2001, with a surge in the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Our then centrist, populist prime minister John Howard seized the moment to proclaim: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”It was a resonant phrase. Like the best political slogans it was impossible to argue with, defending controversial politics with impenetrable rhetoric.\u0026nbspWhen Australians heard the Brexiteer slogan “take back control”\u0026nbspwe immediately recognised what was going on.Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fastDavid Cameron could have taken a leaf from Howard’s playbook. When Howard was confronted with an irresistible push for a referendum in the late Nineties (on Australia becoming a republic, which Howard strongly opposed), he responded with a process ingeniously designed to undermine it: first, a national convention to agree on a model that was inevitably going to be a compromise nobody liked, then a vote in which half the people who wanted a republic would vote against it because it wasn’t the republic they had imagined. Sadly, Howard didn’t offer this advice or Cameron didn’t seek it.So the campaign began. As a foreign correspondent I rarely had to report the daily tennis match. This avoided much of the problem faced by domestic media: the failure of “he said, she said”\u0026nbspjournalism when confronted with daily exaggerations and concoctions from campaigners, and the rejection of expertise.\u0026nbspInstead, my editors wanted to know what was driving public opinion. Not quite a forecast of the result, but understanding of, whichever way it fell, why it had fallen that way.My initial theory was that it would shake out much like the 2014 Scottish referendum. It was to be nationalistic passion and vague promises of future benefits, up against a well-organised steamrolling campaign of warnings about the inevitable costs and risks.Farage says he would rather \u0027go on holiday\u0027 than vote in a second Brexit referendumThe sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surpriseBut then I met an insightful\u0026nbspBrussels thinktank chief, whose depressing logic completely changed my mind.\u0026nbspFabian Zuleeg told me the above theory was “plausible… but not one I believe in”. He asked the simple question: “Who’s going to campaign against Brexit?”Business would be reticent, worried about spooking shareholders. Much of the media were scathingly Eurosceptic. Trade unions were never really on board with the EU. Labour was ided. Cameron was on the nose with voters and had for years (like many of his colleagues) used the EU and immigration as a political punch bag. On the other side were figures like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: stump speakers with mass appeal. I’d met Farage. I understood why he was political catnip.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite frightening,” the thinktank chief said. “If you look at the general attitudes towards migration (in the UK) it’s intensely negative and I think this is going to drive a lot of this agenda.”For an Australian to lecture the UK on political self-harm is, of course, the height of hypocrisy. We’ve changed prime ministers six times in the past 11 years, only twice as the result of an election, and we’re quite likely to do it again in 2019. And if any country is going to sympathise with a nation torn by an endless debate over migration, it’s Australia.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the referendum, though, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull channelled the mood of much of our country: bemused tolerance.\u0026nbsp“If the British people, in their wisdom, decide to stay in the European Union then we would welcome that,” he said a month or so ahead of the vote.\u0026nbspTheresa May to meet opposition leaders as Labour snubs offer of talks More than 170 business leaders urge May to back second referendumCorbyn will do no better than May when it comes to BrexitThere was self-interest too, Turnbull said. Australian businesses like to base in the UK and take advantage of access to the EU.\u0026nbspAnd Australia as a member of the Five Eyes group, sharing intelligence with the UK, felt from a security point of view it was “an unalloyed plus for Britain to remain in the EU”.Then came the vote.\u0026nbsp“We respect the wishes of the British people,” Turnbull said afterwards. Rather optimistically, he added: “I have no doubt that in due course, the British government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union.”Privately, he held a different view. After being deposed, at a private speech in November 2018, Turnbull said what he really thought.\u0026nbspBrexit was a “catastrophe”, he said – a decision “not even understood by the government, let alone by the people. It was absolutely uninformed consent.”Nevertheless, a significant faction of conservative Australian politics\u0026nbsp(including the then high commissioner in London) threw itself\u0026nbspenthusiastically behind Brexit.\u0026nbspSince the vote, then, our official attitude has essentially been:\u0026nbsp“Ok, what’s in it for us?”\u0026nbspMost obviously, there’s a trade deal. Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fast.\u0026nbspWe’re a relatively minor trading partner for the UK (compared with, say, the US), so there’s less at stake and the UK can use us as a kind of training ground before it takes on the ruthless brainboxes from Washington DC. And there’s the Commonwealth link. Brexiteers imagined Commonwealth ties as a\u0026nbspbasis for post-Brexit UK’s international identity.\u0026nbspAustralia is happy to play along with this, especially as Brexiteers seem to think the Commonwealth consists entirely of Australia, New Zealand and Canada.And, finally, it feels like a historical revenge served cold. When the UK joined the EU it triggered a dramatic change in UK-AU trade.\u0026nbspWe lost a market, and it forced us to refocus on our region. In a way it was a favour: Australia prospered hugely from its growing ties to the developing economies to our north.\u0026nbsp But some (especially the older, more Anglophile corner of conservative politics) have never forgotten this slight. When Britain comes begging for post-Brexit favours, it will be a sweet moment indeed.Nick Miller has been the Europe correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in London, since 2013We’ll tell you what’s true.

Forsman wrote the\u0026nbspgraphic novel on which the programme is based.Channel 4 and Netflix revealed in August 2018 that they would be renewing the show for a second series – an announcement met with relief and excitement from fans after the first series ended with a dramatic cliffhanger.The End of the F***ing WorldThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But they need to know about the UK-EU economic relationship,” he said.\u0026nbsp“These are all global companies and therefore they have other possibilities other than staying.“They may relocate.

Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public.”Ms May is pinning her hopes of winning next week’s vote on Mr Cox changing his legal advice, in January, that the UK is in danger of being trapped in the backstop indefinitely.However, that will be far more difficult if the UK is only able to appeal to an arbitrator that the backstop is no longer needed, possibly under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.If the meaningful vote is lost on Tuesday, MPs will have the opportunity to veto a no-deal Brexit and to seek an extension to Article 50 – delaying the UK’s departure from the EU beyond 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

No Brexit bribery, stable investment where it’s most needed.”\u0026nbspSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on the £1.6bn fund, the communities secretary James Brokenshire rejected the money, which will be made available over a six-year period, was a bribe.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbspThis funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country.But there is no constitutionality in that sense, this funding is there to see that towns grow and that we are actually looking at what we need to do, which is seeing those areas really prospering and following through on what the prime minister has really believed in, that sense of leaving no part of our UK behind and how this will help support that.Interesting (and odd) story in The Times newspaper this morning - it carries the claim that the chief secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss refers to herself in the third person as the Truss.\u0026nbspShe is yet to address the claim, but it comes after\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspreports the home secretary Sajid Javid referred to himself as the Saj - a charge he later denied.\u0026nbspDowning Street confirmed that attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will return to Brussels on Tuesday to continue their efforts to secure legally-binding changes to\u0026nbspbackstop arrangements designed to keep the Irish border open.But Ms May\u0027s spokesman declined to discuss reports that Mr Cox has dropped attempts to secure a time limit for the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism, telling reporters: We are now at a particularly critical stage in these negotiations. I\u0027m not going to get into specifics.The spokesman said the UK was definitely making progress after discussions ning the past two weeks with the European Commission, he said.But he added: There definitely remains more work to be done.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It didn’t work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either,” he told an event at the Institute for Government think tank.Labour will order MPs to support fresh Brexit referendum- McDonnell“That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It’s done via the bureaucrats, and the Sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.“The Brits constantly either misunderstand that or just don’t realise that circumventing that and thinking ‘Oh, we can go direct to Berlin or Paris or any other capital and square that off\u0026nbsp– and that will be different from the orthodoxy we’re getting out of Brussels’ – never works.”The government has been frustrated throughout Brexit talks at the lack of direct negotiations between the prime minister and other EU27 presidents and prime ministers.\u0026nbspDespite lurid predictions in some corners of the British press that Angela Merkel would ride to Britain’s rescue and cut a special deal, the bloc has insisted on keeping negotiations between Michel Barnier and his constantly resigning UK counterparts.\u0026nbspThe prime minister has generally only been given limited time to speak on Brexit at European Council summits, with a two-way back and forth generally off the table. When they have happened – as at the summit in December – they have not always gone well.\u0026nbspThe EU has put the unity of the 27 EU member states at the centre of its negotiating strategy during Brexit. Officials close to talks say the UK has tried to split off member states, but with little luck.\u0026nbspBefore he was appointed Brexit secretary, David Davis laid out his strategy in a series of tweets, one of which read: “The first calling point of the UK’s negotiator immediately after Brexit will not be Brussels, it will be Berlin, to strike a deal.”The former UK diplomat Mr Rogers told the same event on Monday that he did not think a customs union would be an option for the UK outside the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“I don’t think it will be sustainable long-term to be in a customs union and not have a greater degree of autonomy over our trade policy,” he said.“We would get consultation rights, sure, we might get superior consultation rights – but they would only be consultation rights – and ultimately the negotiating mandate would reflect the interests of the 27, no doubt articulated carefully to take account of British interests.”He also described the prospect of an extension of Article 50 as “quite problematic” because of the issue of the UK having to take part in European Parliament elections.\u0026nbspMr Rogers stepped down in early 2017, reportedly after a row with Theresa May’s advisers. He had reportedly told ministers privately that Brexit could take a decade to resolve, angering them.We’ll tell you what’s true.

She said she feared she would be detained and tortured again if her latest attempt\u0026nbspfailed.In March last year she was reportedly driven across the Oman border by Tina Jauhiainen, a friend and Finnish capoeira teacher who worked at the royal court, before taking a jet ski to a waiting boat manned by Hervé Jaubert, an-ex French special forces officer. Indian coastguards later intercepted the boat and Latifa\u0026nbspre-appeared nine months later in the Emirati\u0026nbspcity.\u0026nbspThe UAE has repeatedly denied that Sheikh Latifa was forcibly returned home or harmed but has never explained what happened between her dramatic capture in March 2018 and December when photos were released of her back in Dubai.Neither has the young princess been given an opportunity to speak for herself.She is the second of the Sheikh Maktoum\u0027ss daughters to allegedly disappear.\u0026nbspLatifa’s older sister, Shamsa, was reportedly seized on the streets of Cambridge after fleeing the family’s Surrey estate in 2000 and has not been seen or heard from since.The Dubai authorities did not respond to The Independent’s request for comment but has repeatedly denied charges of wrong doing.Rashid Al Maktoum recently flew £250,000 in aid to Haiti in his private jet (Getty Images)In a statement written to Sky News in December, the authorities said were “deeply saddened” by media speculation regarding her situation.They said Latifa was “safe in Dubai” and “looking forward to … building a happy and stable future”.They denied the “false allegations’ and released photos of her with Ms Robinson, who agreed to visit Dubai to meet her in Princess Haya’s home.Ms Robinson said after the visit that the princess was mentally unwell and claimed a ransom had been demanded when she disappeared.“Latifa is vulnerable, she is troubled. She made a video that she now regrets and was part of a plan of escape… under circumstances which need to be examined, Ms Robinson told BBC Radio 4 in December.\u0026nbsp“You have to bear in mind this a troubled young woman who has a serious medical situation. She is receiving psychiatric care. They don’t want to endure any more publicity,” she added.The UAE has not cooperated with the United Nations enquiry into her abduction, and that investigation is ongoingThe former Irish president faced a torrent of criticism from rights groups who said she failed to ask key questions about what why the princess had vanished for so long.Ms Robinson declined to comment on Monday when The Independent reached out to\u0026nbspher.Detained in Dubai’s Stirling said Ms Robinson “appeared to be reciting almost verbatim from Dubai’s script” and dismissed it as a “PR stunt”.“The UAE should have not circumvented normal UN protocols.”Speaking to The Independent Hervé Jaubert, 62 who tried to help the princess escape,\u0026nbspsaid he last spoke to her when he claimed he saw her being dragged off his vessel by the Indian coast guard.\u0026nbsp“I’ve not heard anything from her ever since. I believe she is under watch 247 and they won’t leave her or let her have a phone, he said.\u0026nbspHe said that the princess had first reached out to him in 2011, after a reading his book detailing his own escape and had been planning her flight for seven years.\u0026nbspRecounting the escape, he said his US-flagged yacht was in international waters and off the coast of India when he contacted Detained in Dubai and other rights groups as he noticed they were being tailed by the Indian coastguarHe claimed the 4 March 2018 was a “full-blown military attack” involving three boats and a surveillance plane, and that he was beaten up by the Indian authorities. \u0026nbspHe said he saw Sheikh Latifa be dragged off “kicking and screaming of political asylum.\u0026nbspI believe she is under watch 247 and they won’t leave her or let her have a phone“This is a human right violation. We never saw her again. They took her away on helicopter,”Rights groups have long complained of rights abuses in the UAE and the lack of freedom particular for women, who are subject to a ship system, which means male relatives can take women to court for being disobedient.\u0026nbspThe most recent case of a woman trying to flee the country is Hind al-Bolooki, 43 who made a desperate plea last month for asylum in North Macedonia after escaping the UAE when her family would not grant her a orce.She posted a video online when her asylum claim was rejected, and aid she\u0026nbspfeared being deported back to the UAE.Mr Kinney said “Between Sheikha Latifa and Hind al-Bolooki, you have two very public examples of women who felt compelled to flee in dramatic fashion because of male chauvinism and violence.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-graphic-page10kav.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit theresa may departure comment","story":"The rebuke was echoed on behalf of .million voters by Tory MP Sir Graham Brady to describe Theresa May’s three miserable years of trench warfare with Brussels.Brexiteer Brady is the respected chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs, the legendary “Men in grey suits” who have the power, rarely used, to tell leaders their time is up.“All too often it has looked asthe establishment has wanted a Brexit that looks shockingly like not leaving at all,” Mr Brady told a Sunday newspaper.He might have been describing many of those involved in the tortuous Brexit negotiations, but only one name springs to mind.And it will be Mr Brady’s job to hand her the fabled revolver and glass of whisky when that time comes.While it seems increasingly likely Britain is moving crab-like towards some sort of deal on Brexit by March , Mrs May herself is unlikely to long survive its birth.The price of “success” will be for the PM to name the day of her departure from Downing Street.Theresa May will probably have to be dragged kicking and screaming out of No.Having negotiated a deal of sorts, she will feel entitled to tie up loose ends and — more importantly for her — block Boris Johnson as her successor.She is safe from another assassination bid by MPs after seeing off last year’s abortive challenge.But the mood against her has hardened on all sides.Nick Timothy, once her closest ally, now reveals the PM was never able to see the economic upside to leaving the EU and saw Brexit as a problem “to be managed”.Her mantra, “No deal is better than a bad deal”, was meaningless.She and Chancellor Phil Hammond never intended to prepare our ports, freight terminals, tax centres and border controls for a clean-break Brexit.The loathed Northern Ireland backstop was a ruse to keep us so closely aligned that we might as well have stayed in a customs union and therefore the EU itself.From day one, Theresa May was negotiating BRINO — Brexit in Name Only.Her secretive style even infuriated Remainers such as Amber Rudd, who last week broke Cabinet ranks with her own campaign to stop Brexit.Influential Times columnist Matthew Parris, a staunch Remainer, ex-Tory MP and former May supporter, says both Remainers and Brexiteers have turned against the PM.“Theresa May, they tell me, is the Death Star of modern British politics,” Parris says.“Ideas, beliefs, loyalties, affections, trust, whole careers, real men and women, are sucked into the awful void that is Downing Street — and nothing ever comes out. Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

It was the ship’s last port before ing to Miami and it was the sixth day of a seven-day cruise.Usually the ship sailed at .pm from its stops, but this time the ship departed Nassau, in the Bahamas, two hours earlier than they expected.In an excruciating twist, they had arrived at the port just minutes before the ship was due to sail but didn’t realise it was about to set off.Maria said: “We thought we were on time. We were there .pm or .pm and we heard the call from the ship — but there were so many cruises we thought it was another ship. Then we heard the horn. When we arrived to the pier we were in shock.”Here they saw the gangway had been removed and the vessel was in the process of leaving its moorings.  Maria said: “I think the worst feeling was to see that the boat was still there and knowing we can go inside and see the boat leave without you. “I think I would have preferred to have been at the pier and the boat had already gone.”To make matters worse, the couple realised they had left their passport, visas, and credit cards on board, meaning they were marooned on the island with no money or way out.Fortunately the crew managed to retrieve their travel documents and cards on board before handing them to the pilot who was guiding the ship out of the harbour.He then immediately sailed back to the quayside and handed Maria and Alessandro their passports and wallets.But they were forced to pay £ each to fly back to Miami after the blunder and were reunited with their luggage three days later.At the immigration office they learned they were actually one of six people who missed the boat. Maria said: “There were two other couples. One were very, very angry so we didn’t keep in touch but the other two were nice.Shortly after they ed home the couple found out a video which captured their dockside debacle had gone viral — but they saw the humorous side to it.Maria said: “Of course it would be betterit didn’t happened.

We now believe this is the same in pet dogs because they live in the same domestic environment.”The study is published in the journal Scientic Reports.Allan Pacey, Professor of Andrology at Sheffield University, said lab tests do not always reflect real le.He said: “This is a well conducted study which shows these two man-made chemicals can damage sperm in the laboratory.“However, we need to be careful in the interpretation of these results, because often what we see in the lab is a long way from what we see in real le when humansare going about their daily lives.”Dr Anna Watson, Head of Advocacy at CHEM Trust, said: “Hormone disrupting chemicals, such as the phthalate DEHP, highlighted in this study, have been linked to a reduction in male fertility for many years. But these chemicals are still used in everyday consumer products that we find in our homes.“This important research demonstrates yet again that we need faster, stronger and more comprehensive regulation of man-made chemicals to protect humans and animals from their health–harming properties.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that breakneck timetable risks infuriating the European Research Group of hardline Tory Brexiteers.It warned No its members must have a minimum of  hours to study Mr Cox’s new backstop.Veteran Tory Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash, who leads an ERG  of eight lawyers set up to study the plan, told The Sun: “It would be in the national interest for Parliament to have  hours to scrutinise what Geoffrey Cox proposes before the debateERG deputy chair Mark Francois added: “Because Geoffrey Cox is negotiating this deal, and will therefore be marking his own homework when he advises Parliament, it is critically important that MPs are given good time to look at the detail. Any attempt to bounce the Commons is likely to backfire spectacularly.”But a Government source told The Sun: “I wouldn’t expect to see anything until Monday. You don’t want to give the ERG a weekend of trouble making”.EU officials also suspect Mrs May is planning a last minute pressure trap, and have insisted Mr Cox puts his demands in writing by midweek “at the latest”. One EU diplomat said: “People need to be comfortable. They can’t take us by surprise by coming with a text on the last day”.British and EU negotiators are exploring new legal assurances surrounding the arbitration system which will allow either side to terminate the backstop.An EU source said the two sides were “looking along the lines of good faith and the mechanisms already there in the Withdrawal Agreement”. But they stressed talks were focussed on “clarying things, not fundamentally changing them”, falling short of hard Brexiteer demands. Asked about the possibility of a time limit to or unilateral exit from the backstop, they replied: “That’s not going to happen.”Mr Cox reacted in fury to a claim yesterday that he has abandoned Eurosceptics’ two key backstop asks, for an end date or a unilateral exit mechanism. In a furious tweet, he branded the newspaper report “misunderstood fag ends dressed up as facts”.The package will also include a pledge to set up a joint task force to study a Brexiteer plan for alternative arrangements such as technology to replace the Irish backstop.Any provisional agreement between the Commission and the UK and would still be subject to the endorsement of EU leaders later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a recent survey found that British manufacturers are building up reserves at the fastest pace seen in any leading economy since the early . What you should do. Nothing. There is absolutely no need to stockpile food or medicines. In fact bulk buying could actually create shortages. The NHS   Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of boasting about becoming the biggest purchaser of fridges. And the government has created a logistics hub in Belgium where vital medical supplies will be stockpiled to stop the NHS running short of equipmentthere is a no-deal Brexit. Stents, implants and other products needed to ensure that patient care is not disrupted will be stored at the hub. Perhaps more concerning is that the health service has begun stockpiling body bags. But theyre also keeping medicines, vaccines and blood products.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. But crucially the NHS has insisted that no patients need to stock up on medicine.   AstraZenecahas increased the number of medicines available to pharmacies and hospitals in both the UK and EU by %. All in all the company has spent pound million preparing for no-deal including building labs in Sweden to duplicate product testing. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofihas acquired extra warehouse space in the UK for cold storage of medicines and vaccines. It is also moving some manufacturing operations from the UK to the EU. WHSmith   No one ever runs out of pens right  Well WHSmith is not taking any chances.Instead they are stockpiling six months worth of pens to guard against chaos at the border caused by Brexit .The stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens, diaries and notepads. But the boss of the British firm confirmed they were planning to hold six months worth to avoid disruptions to their supplies. Stephen Clarke, WHSmith’s chief executive, told Bloomberg: We’re used to holding quite a bit of forward cover in terms of stock anyway, so what we’ve done is topped that up a little bit to put ourselves in an even better position should there be congestion at ports.   Tesco Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said the supermarket has been holding a talks with its suppliers and increasing stocks of long-le groceries. But, with Britain importing about half the fresh food it eats, Lewis said it was not possible to make similar arrangements for fresh foodBritain crashes out of the EU. “We looked at the lecycle and production of product categories that matter most to customers and sat down with all suppliers to discuss their production capability, where they hold stock andwe can help them hold it,” explained Lewis. “It’s not possible to do that sort of thing on fresh food, so that’s where the pinch point would bethere were to be a no-deal.”  Marks and Spencer Marks  Spencer said its own Brexit planning committee had “upped the ante” and started to make a “few real choices”. The chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “We have taken some additional long-le stuff but our food business is % fresh and anything that slows down will contribute to cost and waste.”   Dixons CarphoneBritains biggest seller of electricals and mobile phones has said it is prepared for all Brexit scenarios.The group which imports most of its product from Asia had worked with suppliers to make sure disruption was minimised. Some of those had brought stock into the UK early. The companys finance chief said that being the market leader put it in a good position as suppliers were likely to prioritise the company - suggesting that smaller retailers might suffer. Airline food  Companies like Gate Gourmet, which supplies  airlines at  UK airports in the have begun stockpiling frozen main meals, pizzas, dried snacks and sandwiches at warehouses in Peterborough and London. Gate Gourmet produces most of its meals in Germany and Spain. They fear any holdup at the border could disrupt its business model. BMW  Hundreds of trucks carry car parts into the UK on a daily basis to be used in just-in-time supply chains at plants across the country. Manufacturers are concerned about disruption at the border but the way the supply chains work mean stockpiling isnt really a viable option. BMWCustoms Manager StephanFreismuth said that the company could only stockpile for a matter of days. He said that anything longer would require building “the highest building in the world.” “We are looking for additional [warehouse] space but in the end, it’s not possible. We are producing ‘just in time,’ and just in sequence,”Freismuth said, BMW imports about € billionworth of car parts from the EU every year, or double the amount it sources from inside the country. Nissan, Toyota and Honda face similar problems.  Pets at Home Britains biggest pet supplier has begun stockpiling cat and dog food. The chief executive Peter Pritchard has pledged to ensure families do not run out of food for their pets. It is particularly important since % of the companys supplies come from outside the UK. The firm said they were considering holding up to poundm worth. Bentley  The chief executive of Bentley said the company was stockpiling parts. He described Brexit as a “killer” threatening the profitability of the luxury carmaker.   Unilever is stockpiling ice creams in Britain to guard against potential supply disruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Anglo-Dutch consumer giant, which is the worlds largest ice cream seller, makes British favourites likeMagnumbars in Italy and Germany. It is building up a few weeks of extra stock in Britain in case of any border delays. Likewise, several of its European deodorants, including Axe, Dove and Rexona are made in Britain and transported to the continent. A few weeks of extra inventory is one of the important steps we are taking to make sure that we minimise any disruption to our customers and consumers, said Alan Jope, Unilevers new chief executive.

My mother died of cancer and my grandmother, who I never met, died of it too. Her daughter, Melissa Rimington, , remembers that when her mother was fighting the disease, she took a turn for the worst during the summer. She said: It was a hot summer and mum wasnt drinking very much anyway and she spiralled. Madeleine signed up for newchemotherapy treatmentas she wanted the opportunity to help others in the future whilst she was fighting herself. She was given a tester amount and reacted fine, so she started the full treatment. However, she soon began to feel unwell. That is when I was crashing, she added, I dont remember much, I dont remember anything, not even my doctor coming in or the ambulance. My family thought I was okay and that I was recognising everyone who was with me but they didnt realise at the time that my brain just shut down. Madeleine had responded badly to the full  per cent chemotherapy treatment and her body was shutting down. Melissa continued: After mum crashed, the doctor called us in at pm into the intensive care unit, pulled us into a room and basically said Your mum is not going to make it, Im really sorry she only has hours to live. Her kidneys and liver have shut down and we are just waiting for her heart to stop. We just wanted to be with her and comfort her, they kept coming in every  hours to tell us. Then after two days the doctor came back and said I think we need to do a few more tests, because they were expecting her to pass away  hours before. She added: All I kept thinking was that I’ve got to say goodbye to my mum. They put her onend-of-le careand they were just waiting for her heart to stop.” Miracle menopause cream deals with crippling symptoms - and works in seconds Doctors also offered Madeleine pain killers but she said she didnt need them, and staff were baffled and called her an enigma because they hadnt see this before, the mum says. Her daughter continued: It was a rollercoaster of emotions. We slept by Mum’s hospital bed for three solid weeks and I think I cried more in those three weeks than I’ve ever cried in my entire le.” Madeleine added: When I got ill my family slept around me, I was in a room and they were all by my bed in sleeping bags. They survived on sandwiches and fruit from MS and refused to leave my side. She began getting stronger and stronger, however she had lost four stone due to her three weeks in hospital. With her family at her side, including daughters Jojo, , and Katrina, , she was on the mend. After fighting back, Madeleine was put on a lower dose of chemotherapy treatment and the tumour shrunk. When Madeleine was back at home, she was still growing stronger but was too weak to walk on her own. One day, she saw an advert for a wheelchair loan from The Red Cross and showed Melissa, as they were not sure where to go for help. They went to pick up the wheelchair and when they got it home, Melissa took her mum out for the first bit of fresh air that she had felt in a long time after being left housebound through her recovery. It was only a few days after being discharged in September that she decided it was time to ask her partner, Ray, of  years, to tie the knot. I called him up at work, he is a commercial boiler engineer so he must have been knee deep in the stuff, Madeleine said. And I said, Its just a quick one, would you want to marry me  and he replied, without hesitation yes, so I said okay then, Ill see you when you get home later.   After Ray accepted her proposal, she began planning the wedding straight away to get wed in November. Madeleine and her daughters did most of the wedding planning, but Ray chose the first dance song as Angel by Robbie Williams, after telling her that whenever he hears that song he thinks of her. For some time, she was worried that she might not make it for the wedding. I told my daughters thatI dont make it, to not cancel anything and have the day as a wake, Madeleine said. But she did make it and even better - she walked down the aisle. On November , , the couple made it official at Orsett Hall,Thurrock. Although the wheelchair was there for the day and during the all-important wedding dress shopping trips, Madeleine walked down the aisle to meet Ray waiting for her. That wheelchair was a godsend, the -year-old said. AndI hadn’t seen that advert I don’t know what we would have done. I was housebound before. The wheelchair helped me to get outside, in the sunlight and the fresh air. We were really worried that Mum wasn’t going to be able to walk down the aisle,says Melissa.The wheelchair took a lot of pressure off. Mum wouldn’t have been able to do it without it. The next step to Madeleines recovery mayinclude a hysterectomyas she awaits consultation with her doctor. This can aid the mum to continue on her road to recovery. When I finally come round, I didnt understand why I lived because I shouldnt have, said Madeleine, Im now thinking I will tell my story to help others. Michael Lascelles, British Red Cross mobility aids hub manager responsible for Essex, says:British Red Cross believes everyone who needs a wheelchair should be able to get one that is right for them to help with their recovery, and the tireless efforts of our volunteers help to make this possible. We are so proud to have been a part of Melissa and Ray’s special day and we wish them every happiness for the future.

But it took him a while to find Princess Diana and there were lots of other potential suitors along the way. Anna Wallace was the closest he came to finding a royal bride before Diana, and he reportedly proposed to her twice. Anna, who was nicknamed Whiplash Wallace due to her fiery personality and impressive hunting skills, rejected him on both occasions.According to the Express , Anna, the daughter of a Scottish landowner, ended things after a row at the Queen Mothers th birthday party at Windsor Castle.She apparently accused Charles of ignoring her at the ball, and was overheard telling him: I have never been so badly treated in my le.   Youve left me all alone all evening and now you will have to continue without me. Oh dear... Anna ended up marrying Johnny Hesketh, the youngest son of a Lord, but they later orced.During his bachelor days Charles also dated Dianas sister Lady Sarah Spencer. Not much is known about their brief relationship in , but its understood it all ended after she did an interview with the Mirrors James Whittaker .James met Lady Sarah when she joined Prince Charles for a holiday in the Swiss ski resort Klosters. Recalling the event in , James wrote: My mission improbable as a young journalist was to discover who Charles would marry and be first with the news.   So when Sarah introduced me to Diana I should have taken more notice of the shy, gangly--year old. Sarah by contrast was a lively, lovely redhead and I was captivated. Putting obvious obstacles aside – like she was totally out of my league and stepping out with the most eligible bachelor in the land – I chanced my arm. James suggested the pair meet for lunch when they got back to London, and she accepted. He said: Unfortunately another reporter overheard our exchange and also invited himself along, which added gooseberry to the menu. Sarah was disarmingly frank about her boyfriend and declared she would not marry Charleshe were the dustman or the King of England.   That was good news from where I was sitting and Sarah seemed delighted I was so keen to share it with the nation. But when Charles found out, he wasnt happy. He reportedly told said to Sarah: You have just done something incredibly stupid. Despite the slightly awkward history, Sarah was said to completely approve of Charles and Dianas relationship. According to the , she said: I introduced them, Im cupid. Lady Sarah married Neil McCorquodale the year before Diana and Charles tied the know. They now have three children, Emily, George, and Celia. She is still close to her nephews Princes William and Harry, and attended Meghan and Harrys wedding earlier this year.

And this was doubled when they found out they were expecting twin boys - Harry and Elijah. But then, just two years later, when they discovered they were about to become mum and dad a second time round they couldnt believe it when they were told they were having a SECOND set of twins .The family is now made up of Jessica, Liam, Harry and Elijah, aged two, and their twin girls, Phoebe and Aria, who arrived last September. Both the pregnancies were unplanned and medics told them the chances of having twin boys followed by girls was rarer than being struck by lightening.   And while the pair never imagined theyd have two sets of twins this early in le, they say they wouldnt change a thing and their perfect family feels complete. Proud Jessica, from Deal, Kent, said: It might not be what we had planned when we first met but weve got our whole family done and dusted in the space of a few years. Two boys, two girls, two sets of twins - its just the perfect package. Were the perfect family to me and it feels meant to be. It was four unexpected babies, but now I wouldnt change it for the world. Chef Liam added: To think that Im a dad of four does feel pretty crazy.   People my age are usually living at home with their mum and dad, just thinking about going out or going to uni. Having them has made me want to do more in my le. It makes me want to make them proud. The pair met at work in Wetherspoons four years ago, aged , and admit they werent very good with contraceptives. Bar manager Jessica broke the first pregnancy news to Liam by joking she would have to buy him a Fathers Day card. But while they both have twins in their families, they never imagined theyd have twins until they saw two shapes on the sonogram at the  week scan. The pair admit le was crazy while they got used to Harry and Elijah, who arrived via c-section, on February , , at  weeks, weighting lb oz, and lb oz. Jess said: Id only just got used to the idea of having one baby when I found out it was two.  It was a bit overwhelming. I wanted boys so I was glad to find out it was boys. I do feel like now with the girls I appreciate them being babies more. With the boys I think I was just getting used to being a mum so it felt I was always trying to keep up - doing one thing then the next then the next, whether it was nappies or bottles. But now I know they are fine, I know what Im doing. This time I know what to do. The couple confess they were happy as a family of four and had no plans to have more children. But Jessica found out she was pregnant again just after her sons had turned two and the couple said they were pleased to be having one more. She went to the scan with Liams sister - and just a few moments in realised it was twins when she saw the two little blobs. Liam said: Even the second time it was % a surprise. Jessica added: My first words were oh no, not again. As soon as we told people they thought we were joking nobody would believe us. It wasnt until I put a photo of the scans of both of them on Facebook that I think people really believed us.Jessica had heart issues and fainting episodes during the pregnancy. Doctors made the decision to perform a C-section early. Phoebe and Aria were born on September , six weeks early both weighing lb oz. Both sets of twins are non identical. Liam said: In some ways it has been easier with four than two. With the boys, because we had just got together and we were so young, Jessica would get looks. Now were been together, got the boys, got a house and were settled. But having said that, when you have two toddlers and two newborns, it is a lot to get your head around.  People do still stare, but I think weve got used to it. Jessica said the boys love being big brothers, and have become very protective of their little sisters. She added: Bringing the girls home to the boys was a lovely moment. The boys are really good with them. The first couple of days it was a bit of a novelty, but we soon found our feet. The boys will run around and help, fetching nappies or things, and they are very protective and loving. The other day Harry had a little go at me because I picked up Aria and she started to cry and told me to put her down. They are really good big brothers. With the first twins we hadnt been together long. But this time around weve done it before and we were strong, so people were much more congratulatory. In some ways it has been easier. We had done it all before, we knew roughly how much it was going to cost and we were more prepared. The best thing I learned was to get in as much sleep as possible before they arrived and I started going to bed at about pm because I knew that I wasnt going to get long lie ins for a very long time!

On Sunday, the icy gales felled trees, damaged property and closed many roads to high-sided traffic.Although the Met Office confirmed that Freya had passed into the North Sea, easing winds in the East, it warned of more unsettled conditions. A spokesman said: “The jet stream is bringing us a more unsettled pattern. “That pattern is on repeat for the next few days and indeed into the weekend.” Residents had to clear snow which fell in Cumbria near the Northumberland border earlier today. Western and southern parts of the UK bore the brunt of Freya’s strong winds, with a top speed of mph recorded at Mumbles Head in West Glamorgan at pm on Sunday.  The highest speed recorded in England was mph at Emley Moor, West Yorkshire, around  miles from Leeds-Bradford Airport, where pilots’ skills were once again tested by strong cross-winds. There remains a risk of more rain, wind, sleet and snow in areas of high ground in the North. The rain will move into Northern Ireland, northern England and Scotland today, with other areas seeing sunnier spells giving way to cloud and rain in the South-West later. The outlook for Wednesday and Thurshysshyshyday includes occasional heavy rain and strong winds. Friday is expected to be drier and brighter, with sunny spells.

An electronic restriction will apply to all cars made from mid- onwards. The Swedish firm, bought by Chinese firm Zhejiang Geely in , has long had a reputation for prioritising road safety. Volvo is believed to be the first carmaker planning to install the cap across its range however police vehicles will be exempt. The general speed limit for motorways in EU member states is -mph . Germany does not have a general cap for motorways but recommends a speed of up to mph. In a statement Volvo said the electronic restriction focused on driver behaviour because mechanical solutions alone could not ensure safety.   Speeding remained one of the main contributors to road deaths, Volvo said, along with drug and drink intoxication and mobile phone use. Haringkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s president and chief executive, said: “While a speed limitation is not a cure-all, it’s worth doingwe can even save one le. We want to start a conversation about whether carmakers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver’s behaviour.”   Volvo said it is also looking at ways to address the problems of driving while distracted or intoxicated. It said it will present plans for technology to address those problems later this month. The European Union is considering requiring whats known as Intelligent Speed Assistance on new cars sold there by . That equipment would require cars to have technology that would make them comply with speed limit signs. However, with the UK having left the European Union by then, it is unclearthat would work on British roads.

Guests are nicely boozed, but not sloppy drunk. Theres often laughter and tears and, of course, a chilled glass of bubbly.On occasion, however, the speeches are memorable for all the wrong reasons. Just ask this seriously disgruntled bride... The bride in question got married last Saturday and her maid of honour, her sister, gave a long speech which got her booted out of the wedding.   So how bad was it  Decide for yourself...Taking to Reddit , the bride said: During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how in that moment, I knew he was the one for me... .I thought her speech was really selfish. I think its super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. Ninety per cent of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how strong she was.   Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! SorryI sound selfish, but in my opinion there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. But my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. If the bride was after tea and sympathy, she was barking up the wrong tree. While some people did agree the sister had made a bit of a bad move, plenty of others called the bride out for how she handled it.  The lack of compassion for mental illness is also quite apparent in both the bride and her parents, one comment read. Someone  added: Also, does she not realise this is now the one thing people will remember about her wedding  How she went all jealous gorilla and locked her sister out. Like, wow. Theyre gonna talk about this for years. She seems more upset not every second was focused on her than about the speech itself, another comment agreed. Maybe her sister didnt give the best speech of the year but she certainly doesnt sound disruptive.

Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park.

The conditions mean she can only drink one or two alcoholic drinks occasionally, so the couple wanted to create something she could enjoy and savour, but also tackle the binge-drinking culture.Called Canna’B, the drinks will be available from Wednesday, while a CBD-infused limited edition will be released next month.The name, which came to Rebecca in her sleep, stems from Canna from the cannabis plant, and the ‘b’ at the end of the spirits is from the honey used to create the new drink.Rebecca and Calum also believe they have a world’s first after ageing the rum with the hemp plant for  days.Calum said: “Wee Hemp Spirits came along when Rebecca, myself and our dog were walking in the Cairngorms.“As people know, we are very fond of hemp and its many uses and we were looking to see how we could marry the hemp plant with spirits.“It hit us to combine hemp with a gin and a rum.Both contain our hemp seeds and our hemp plant material. We have also used award-winning honey from Royal Deeside inside the gin and the rum, as well as ancient spring water from the Cairngorms.“This has been going on since July  and we originally wanted to release them before Christmas, but we didn’t want to rush them and we wanted to make sure they were spot-on. We have done small batches and have  bottles of each for the first run.“With our rum we have aged it in charred hemp stocks which is a world first. It gives it a smoky and subtly sweet flavour.” The husband and we are aiming to break the stigma surrounding hemp. Rebecca said: “We want to showcase the hemp plant and our passion for it.“We wanted to create a drinking experience like no other, one that can be savoured and enjoyed.“We have used it in the CBD but it has so many other uses and it is one of the key things we want to try to get across to people.“It can be used as a botanical in the ageing process.#This is the start of our new business adventure and we’ll look at other ways it could be possibly used.“We want to break down that stigma and use amazing local produce for the spirits.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14082974.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/2_SexBeast.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

South Ayrshire Council’s attempts to open a pound million market have been hit by more inactivity. Bosses claim they are now targeting a May opening date – almost two years later than scheduled. Officials this week admitted they had suffered “signicant delays” in their bid to reopen the former Clydesdale Bank and Suburbia Bar. An initial revival date of September  was promised when council chiefs began their transformation of the site. Last February former Ayr Renaissance boss David Bell said: David Bell said: “Work is scheduled to be complete in late spring this year, when we’ll open the ground floor as a market square to help create a busy new attraction for Ayr town centre.” But the finished article has never materialised. The ill-fated Renaissance team bought the building in March  with a view to breathing new le into the bottom end of the town. The site is where farmers sold their corn to merchants from the s to . And the vision for a new market was formulated to hark back to Ayr’s glorious status as county town. A council spokesman admitted: “There have been signicant delays to this project. However, we are committed to opening the market and events space as quickly as possible for the people of Ayr and beyond. “We have a short specialist fit-out contract to complete, which should be ready for the start of May so that the building can be used for markets and events from the summer.” Ayr councillor Martin Dowey said: “It has been one sorry excuse after another with this building and frankly the people of Ayr and beyond deserve far better.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"sleazy oap 72 who took","story":"NewsSleazy OAP, , who took pics of Ayr schoolgirls in mini-skirts told youre guilty all day longRetired architect Ross McKay was told by a sherf he \"should be able to control\" himself at his age.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsRoss Mackay was placed on the sex offenders register \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner who took pictures of schoolgirls in mini skirts will be on the sex offenders’ register for the next three years, writes Edwin Lawrence. Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March . Sherf Montgomery told McKay at the trial: “There is overwhelming evidence it was you in your car. “You’re guilty all day long.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSex crimeAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14066677.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elr_ayp_260613babs.jpg","title":"tributes paid mr gaiety ayr","story":"NewsTributes paid to Mr Gaiety as Ayr theatre legend Bernard Cotton diesBernard Cotton was a do-it-all theatre manager in the Gaietys pomp and booked acts like Billy Connolly, Ken Dodd and Barbara Windsor.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsBernard outside his beloved Gaiety \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man who was ‘Mr Gaiety’ in Ayr for nearly two decades has died suddenly, aged , writes Edwin Lawrence. Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still

One of the ways is by going into local businesses to encourage them to cut down on what they use.ldquoAn idea we have also had is introducing a pint deposit scheme, similar to the one which is in place at Murrayfield.ldquoThat is something we could look at bringing to Melrose at events such as the Rugby Sevens to cut down on single use plastic. Everyone pays for one pint pot and it is reused, rather than just thrown away.The Scottish Government is also currently shaping a lsquodepositschemersquo for drinks containers following positive feedback in a public consultation.If brought in, it would see consumers reclaim a percentage of the cost of every plastic bottle they recycle.A similar scheme has also been introduced in Norway.Val Miller, vice chairwoman of Melrose Community Council said: ldquoPlastic Free Melrose can take our support as a given.ldquoThere is so much plastic these days. Most of what you buy in the supermarket is pre-packed, no matter how much you try to get away from it.Campaigners have also been working with local schoolchildren to teach them about plastic pollution.And the group recently organised a litter pick around the town.Mr Rawson said: ldquoThe issue needs to be stopped at its source.ldquoIf your bath is overflowing, you donrsquot just pull the plug out ndash you turn the taps off.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Activities will be relocated where in Musselburgh.A spokesman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe building on Bridge Street, which currently houses the cafeacute, is used for a small number of hours each week. The initiative was launched in  when internet access was less readily available at home, school or in other settings.ldquoIn recent years, visits to the building have tended to be for generic youth activities. There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources. This will allow us to make increasingly effective use of assets in a challenging financial climate.Turning to the MECLC, he stressed that the centre, a council building managed on its behalf by FES, would not close and there would be no displacement of current activities. It was, he added, about ldquomaximising use of the building in the delivery of services.The spokesman explained: ldquoIt is proposed that a small number of CLD staff who currently work out of office facilities within the Musselburgh East Community Learning Centre, relocate to office facilities at an alternative location. These staff are not involved with the day-to-day running of the building or the activities which take place there, as it is managed by FES under a separate contract. This arrangement continues.ldquoWe are always keen to maximise the use of community buildings and are exploring whether it might be possible to establish additional provision within the building in the future. This will be discussed in detail with the management committee and stakeholders in due course. The proposal relates to year two of the budget ndash  .Councillor Andy Forrest, Labour, a ward member and Depute Provost of East Lothian, said: ldquoWith the current restraints on council budgets due to cuts in funding from the Scottish Government, moving the Inter.Esk Cafeacute to a new venue where it will not be a stand-alone facility will enable staff to promote digital inclusion to a wider number of people and therefore service a wider range of the community.He added: ldquoWith regard to MECLC, this facility has been on the rise since it was opened. Relocation of staff will not have any effect on activities that are run from or at the centre. The management group will continue to work with and support East Lothian staff with projects and activities.Councillor Stuart Currie, a Musselburgh member and leader of the SNP Group, said: ldquoThe whole point of the Inter.Esk Cafe was to provide facilities for young people in a safe place. We donrsquot have a community centre in Musselburgh. We have got the Brunton Hall but not a drop-in community centre.He added that there had been no discussions about the proposal with the Musselburgh Common Good Committee which he chaired although the building was in the Common Good portfolio. He added that Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council or the wider community had not been consulted.He described the decision to relocate CLD staff as a ldquocash grab.Mr Currie said: ldquoMy concern is that the centre was built in the heart of the community and the whole point of having people working for the council is that they should be based in the community.

Relocating the CLD staff from MECLC allows other options for this building to be considered including use by East Lothian Council departments or sub-let to a third sector organisation.Councillor John Williamson, SNP, commented on the closure of the Inter.Esk Cafe, saying: ldquoFor the sake of pound, a year the Inter.Esk Cafe is going to close following decisions made by Labour and Conservative councillors at the East Lothian Council budget meeting on Tuesday. The cafeacute provides a safe place for young people aged - to meet, have access to computers, make friends and get support for any issues they are having to deal with.ldquoIt is centrally located in Musselburgh and on a main bus route so is easily accessible to users.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story. Go find the Kingrsquos Chair for yourself and see what your imagination comes up with!"},{"url":null,"title":"double-cash-boost-for-our-community-kitchen-project-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen has been awarded more than pound,, which it will use over the next year.The bulk of the money has come from Big Lottery Scotland, with pound, awarded to see the group expand to three days a week from next month.Already, the project meets on a Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club.In the coming weeks, it will also meet on a Wednesday and Thursday, hosting dozens of people at each session and serving a hearty three-course meal for a donation of pound.Elaine Gale, spokeswoman for the project, felt Our Community Kitchen was well on the road to being a success.She said: ldquoIt is so exciting for the area and just to see where we go next.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-did-tutti-frutti-pass-the-test-of-time","story":"AT a minute before half past nine on Saturday night a lot of Scots of a certain age were having feelings more mixed than a Moscow Mule. The new BBC Scotland channel was about to make history by showing a repeat.Not just any repeat, though. This was Tutti Frutti, the six-part, Glasgow-set comedy drama that disappeared into a television Bermuda Triangle in  because of musicproblems and had not been broadcast on TV since.The dramarsquos absence fed the legend. Danny and Suzi. Eddie Clockerty and Miss Toner. The music. The gallusness. The six Baftas, and none of your Scottish ones either, for this was a hit across the UK.Who are the funniest  people in Scotland Some  years had passed, and now it was coming back. Hence the mixed feelings. Tutti Frutti has been the Alpha and Omega of Scottish popular culture, a touchstone, the lodestar. Would it be as good as we remembered Fears melted away in the first seconds, courtesy of Little Richard proclaiming the finest phrase rock and roll ever gave the English language: ldquoA wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom! The opening credits rolled and there they were again, The Majestics, the nearly made it band from Glasgow who were just about to embark on a silver jubilee tour when their lead man, Big Jazza, was killed in a crash. Just like James Dean, except Jimmy wasnrsquot on a kebab run at the time.Tutti Frutti sWriter John Byrne opened his tale where all the good ones begin, at a funeral. The mourners are about to lower the coffin when a taxi pulls up at the Necropolis and out steps Danny McGlone, Jazzarsquos younger brother, all the way from New York City. Eddie Clockerty, gents haberdasher talent agent looks at Danny and ponders whether he could take Jazzarsquos place. By the time the funeral is over and Vincenthas led The Majestics in an acapella version of Three Steps to Heaven, you knew it was going to be okay. Test of time: passed with flying colours.Before the series proper began, there was a repeat of a documentary made to mark the National Theatre of Scotlandrsquos  production of Tutti Frutti. While it unfortunately contained a huge spoiler, it also had interviews with Byrne, Richard Wilson and Robbie Coltrane, the latter saying not a day of his career went by without someone asking what had happened to Tutti Frutti.Basically, the BBC failed to get world clearance for the songs. ldquoThat shows how much confidence they had in it, said artist and playwright Byrne, who delivered the series in instalments insisting no changes be made. He would not budge, either, on Coltrane for Danny Jazza - a bold move given the young comedian was then a relative unknown.Certain things inevitably dated the piece: people using phone boxes, men calling women ldquobirds, Swiss cheese plants in West End flats. Yet everything that made Tutti Frutti sing first time around makes it work again today. Get a load of Kettles and Danny sparking off each other like Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. Check out the settings School of Art the glorious use of language the banter the laughs. Most of the latter are supplied by the partnership of Eddie and his PA bane of his le, Miss Toner. ldquoYoursquore on a verbal warning, McClockerty tells her. ldquoAye, thatrsquoll be right, Janice bats back.Miss Toner is pure dead Glesga, which is another thing that brings a certain moistness around the eye area - Byrnersquos obvious love of the city and its people. He is to Glasgow what Alan Bleasdale is to Liverpool and Alan Bennett to Leeds: the place is in his DNA, he ldquogets it. The first episode takes viewers up to the reformed Majesticsrsquo first gig, in a Miners Welfare Institute . The Majestics are present and correct, brothel creepers on, qufs sculpted and sideburns straight out of a carpet factory. The first set, which we do not see, has been a disaster, but now Suzi Kettles has turned up and Danny is a man transformed, belting out Great Balls of Fire and the title song. The boys are back in town, and they are about to get a new band member.

Wrong. Indeed, as a Eurosceptic I even wrote a letter arguing that people should vote Remain in order to fight the dysal and unaccountable EU along with their unfair trade practices within rather than Leave. However, the majority vote was to leave and the rest is history as they say ndash but with hindsight I must admit that my original belief that there was a chance the EU could be reformed in a meaningful way has been proved wrong by the intransigence displayed by the EU ldquonegotiators thus far.Yes, Brexit will hit us harder initially but in my view Britain will adapt much quicker than than people think and provided we take tough decisions early on we will have a much brighter future ahead of us as a global player free to do our own trade deals.Ian Lakin,Pinelands,Murtle Den Road,Milltimber, Aberdeen.Read more: Conservatives warn Sturgeon against holding new voteIT is a shame that you chose apparently to support the nonsense of those attempting to tear the UK out of the EU with your Letters Page headline ldquoThe betrayal of those who voted to leave will never be forgiven .

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Tuesday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Given that controllers have now voted to go on strike, it would appear that the problems extend more widely than just centralisation.“Given the leline nature of our air services, the impact that industrial action will have on those services must be taken extremely seriously.

It was followed by the University of Dundee, which posted a deficit of £.m, and Glasgow Caledonian University , which finished the year £.m in the red. Six other Scottish institutions made losses in -, including Edinburgh‘s Queen Margaret and Napier Universities, which posted deficits of £.m and £.m respectively. The sector overall finished £.m in the black, thanks to large surpluses at institutions such as the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, which posted figures of £.m and £.m respectively. However, statistics published last year by the Higher Education Statistics Agencysuggest that the finances of Scottish universities are less healthy than they were in -.Their combined deficit that year stood at just £m, almost half the current figure, while the sector’s overall surplus was £m, around £m higher than in -. A spokesman for HESA said it was due to publish its - figures later this month, but that the accounts information reported by universities should be comparable to last year’s data. Universities Scotland said it was the third year in a row that half of the nation’s universities had finished in deficit and called for ministers to take action. “There is a clear pattern emerging at the sector level where the gradual erosion of Scottish Government funding is really starting to make itself felt,” a spokeswoman said. “Every undergraduate student place that the Scottish Government provides is underfunded, and funding for university research does not cover its full cost. “Universities need to see a steady climb to sustainable levels of investment in their teaching, research and capital grantsthey are to maintain their global competitiveness.” RGU said its deficit was mainly driven by the “exceptional costs” of terminating long-term debt, changes to pension contributions and financial adjustments. “The underlying result for the year is a deficit of £.m,” a spokesman added. “The university has a strong, liquid balance sheet and this strength will ensure that it can continue to deliver on its ambitious plans in teaching excellence and impactful research.” The University of Dundee cited a fall in core funding from the Scottish Funding Council, as well as “increasing compliance costs, pension cost pressures and uncertainty in relation to Brexit”. A spokesman added: “We have already recorded a signicant increase in tuition fee income and have set out ways of improving our ability to invest in areas of strength.” GCU said its deficit included a “signicant non-cash charge of £.m for staff pensions”. “Such charges are being experienced in organisations across the country as the valuation of pension liabilities is being adversely affected by the current low interest rates in the UK,” a spokeswoman added. Higher education minister Richard Lochhead said: “We have invested over £bn in our universities every year since -. This will continue for -, supporting our institutions to remain attractive, competitive and truly excellent in global terms.”This story first appeared on our sister title the i. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch things are hotting up on indy front","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Are we heading for the declaration of a second independence strategy or a fresh campaign before the SNP#s April conference  The received wisdom is that Nicola Sturgeon’s hyper-caution combined with the static nature of opinion polls, continuing uncertainty over Brexit and the near inevitability of another Section  rebuff all make a second independence campaign impossible in the short term.But some straws in the wind suggest otherwise.The Scottish Government’s announcement about a separate Scottish currency, effectively rejecting the controversial Growth Commission recommendation, does look like a gearing up – and not just to avoid dficult questions at conference.

The Conservatives also seem to be upping the ante. Last week an anonymous government minister warned “there’ll be no escaping the Brexit disaster for Scots”. He or she was apparently just one among “a number of senior figures” briefing the BBC against the prospect of another indyref. Methinks they doth protest too much. Meanwhile there are suggestions that the Scottish Tories have urged the Prime Minister to “keep hold of all the cards” in the event of a second referendum so that London decides the date, question and franchise – a clear acknowledgment that allowing under-s and non-European citizens to vote again would be enough toa small Yes vote right now.In  most EU nationals voted No, after scare stories that an iScotland would be forced to quit the EU. But since the Brexit vote and the UK government’s failure to guarantee rights to folk who’ve made their entire lives in Britain, almost every EU national still here will back independence second time around. They won’t be fooled again.Similarly, , - and -year-olds voted in  and around  per cent backed independence, according to a poll carried out by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft. Since the next indyref will also determine access to jobs in Europe, the result’s likely to be an even stronger Yes vote among young Scots next time. Last week’s ridiculous claim by David Mundell suggests he also knows how Brexit may soon change the political landscape north of the Border.The Scots Secretary said Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP actually want a no-deal Brexit to “pursue their fantasy of independence”. Mr Mundell insisted: “They pretend to oppose no deal, yet no deal is their real aim. They hope it will cause chaos, confusion and boost support for independence. Everything  that they do or say on Brexit has been a publicity stunt.”Now a man who shares party membership with Chris ‘no resignation’ Grayling, Boris ‘zipwire’ Johnson and Jacob ‘backstop-ultimatum’ Rees Mogg has clearly had practice in recognising the hallmarks of the cynical gesture and the empty stunt. But suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wants a no deal Brexit – are you having a laugh  Since Mr Mundell has clearly been on another planet for the last two years, he’s missed the fact that Sturgeon’s been getting pelters from Yessers for appearing more interested in saving Britain than readying Scotland for indyref. Chaos might well look like “the best backdrop for another campaign for independence” to politicians who are quite prepared to break up Britain and wreck livelihoods over hysterical fears about foreign workers and dogmatic beliefs about the benefits of unregulated free trade, but there’s been no occasion over the last two years when the First Minister has forgotten the entirely negative long-term impact of Brexit on Scotland, realising that dferent cross-border trade arrangements aren’t ideal birthing conditions for any new state.You can only conclude that the sudden eruption of rattling by Tories north and south of the Border means Whitehall expects the SNP leader to call for another Section  order sooner rather than later.And why might that be – because any kind of Brexit, hard or soft, on  March or a few months later, opens up a whole new set of scenarios for Scotland.Once Britain has actually withdrawn from the EU, it’s likely that the EU and the smaller trade body EFTA will approach Scotland offering rival membership deals in the event of a vote for independence second time around.Senior officials in Iceland are openly discussing the many advantages of having Scotland as a new member of the EFTA halfway house and thereby creating a powerful bloc with three contiguous North Atlantic states controlling vital sea routes, fishing grounds, oil and gas fields and a vast wind, marine and geothermal renewable energy resource. If Gavin McCrone was writing another memerandum to ministers today about the strategic and economic potential of such a move, he might again conclude an independent Scotland “would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree”, eventhe big income from decades of oil and gas predicted  years ago has largely been squandered by successive UK governments.Meanwhile, academics at the recent Oxford conference on Rewriting the UK Constitution have predicted that the EU will make a public offer to Scotland once Brexit means there’s no further risk in offending Britain and no conflict of interest in wooing the Scots instead. And why wouldn’t the EU want us  Regaining five million generally progressive, pro-EU citizens in the wake of Britain’s acrimonious departure would be an important boost to the European project.Any bidding war between EFTA and the EU would serve to bolster the viability of Scottish independence, consolidate a new Brexit-oriented strategy and increase support for another Scottish vote. Of course who knows what will happen next with Brexit Theresa May’s deal may get the go-ahead, but her new assurances on the Irish backstop may not satisfy Brexiteers. An extension to Article , allowing time for a second Brexit vote, might let the SNP trade support for an understanding on a future Section  order. In short, things are hotting up on the independence front even though the issue and the SNP have been virtually cut out of mainstream political debate.Momentum is building and those opposing Scotland’s right to self-determination in the light of Brexit know it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli celebrities like stacey dooley should think twice about comic relief","story":"There are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country#s complicity in their plight, writes Dani GaravelliIt’s a shame an important discussion about the tone of Comic Relief has been focused so directly, and so vituperatively, on one woman – Stacey Dooley, and I can’t help wonderingthe fact she’s glamorous and female has something to do with how she has been targeted. I am not suggesting the Instagram photograph she posted with a random black child on her hip is unproblematic. MP David Lammy was right to point out it plays on all those tired old “white saviour” tropes. But Dooley is not just some C-list celebrity who has popped her head into Uganda to boost her own profile. She may currently be dancing on Strictly, but she is also a documentary maker with a track record of tackling serious subjects: sweat shops, people trafficking and child soldiers. Forcing her to take the flak for the cloying paternalism of Comic Relief seems harsh and lets an awful lot of other people off the hook.Thirty years after Live Aid, most people of my generation, who sang along with gusto to Do They Know It’s Christmas  cannot hear the line: “So tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” without a visceral sense of shame. We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage. I went to a clinic for HIV sufferers, and I went to a slum’.”Dooley is not a villain. She shouldn’t be expected to carry the can for Comic Relief’s enduring colonialism. But perhapsshe and others were exposed to more voices like McGrath’s, they would think twice about treating black children like some sort of fashion accessory. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament and welsh assembly to vote simultaneously on brexit motion","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales will today vote simultaneously on a motion declaring members# opposition to the #damaging Brexit deal# agreed by the UK Government.A majority of MSPs are expected to back the motion which claims that a No Deal outcome would be “completely unacceptable”.It also calls for an extension to Article  to find the best way forward to protect the interests of Scotland, Wales and the UK as a whole.Constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell said: “This is an unprecedented event: the first time in  years of devolution that the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales have debated the same motion simultaneously.“We are taking this historic step to send a strong message to the UK Government that it must stop pursuing such a disastrous course of action.“The Prime Minister’s deal will cause major, lasting damage to jobs, living standards and public services such as the NHS and should be voted down.

Road closures, part time or permanent. Managed vehicular access for disabled users and to ensure emergency access is maintained.. Introducing banned turns.. Altering streets to become one way.. Increasing footway widths reducing carriageway widths.. Removal of street furniture.. Parking suspensions, limiting loading times.. Altering traffic signal timings to increase pedestrian phases.. Relocating bus stops and taxi ranks.. Introduction of new counter terrorism measures.However they say a key aim will be to minimise the impact on bus services “by careful planning of route ersions or temporary stop changes.”The plan are being drawn up in response to growing concerns from councillors, community groups, heritage organisations and environmntal campaigners about the impact of heavy traffic and congested streets in August.Councillors agreed in November to press ahead with plans to “ensure the safe movement of both residents and visitors to the city during the peak summer season” amid warnings from officials that maintaining public safety was becoming a “growing issue.”Lothian Buses, Police Scotland, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the Scottish Ambulance Service and representatives of the taxi trade have been involved in talks so far. However full details of the plans for each hotspot are not due to be revealed until May.Place director Paul Lawrence, who will report on the plans to the council’s transport committee today, said: “The main purpose of developing a temporary street operations plan is to address the observed pavement crowding, and related safety and access issues, that occur in the Old Town during the summer.“The locations are those where officers consider that greater pedestrian space or priority will reduce the potential for pedestrian overspill into live traffic, or where changes will improve access for all pedestrians regardless of their level of mobility. “Any changes that impact on private vehicle, public transport, or taxi access to or through the city will disproportionately impact on those who depend on those forms of transport. “The development of detailed proposals will prioritise the needs of public transport services and seek, with key stakeholders to identy how best to minimise these impacts, such as through by careful planning of route ersions or temporary bus stop changes.“Improved conditions for pedestrians will make moving through Old Town streets much safer and easier for a wide range of pedestrians, in particular those with disabilities, including physical, sensory or mobility impairments and long-term conditions, those with small children and those who are frail or elderly.“Although changes to the level of vehicle access in some areas may deliver temporarily improvement to air quality conditions at some locations, detailed proposals may lead to temporary worse air quality, noise and congestion on ersion routes or other streets and areas, as vehicle drivers choose alternative routes.“For local communities, there is some potentialthat in some very specic localised sites that there may be an increase in noise disturbance and anti-social behaviour.”Council transport leader Lesley Macinnes said: “We’re extremely lucky to live in such a vibrant, bustling festival city, benefiting from a world-class calendar of events. But with this status comes the added pressure of managing the safety and security of the many thousands of residents and visitors who take to our streets every day, especially during the busy summer months.“These proposals, which are at an early stage, will create calmer, safer environments on some of our busiest streets during the summer festivals, while maintaining access to the Old Town where possible.”Edinburgh World Heritage director Adam Wilkinson said: “We welcome the measures to improve the pedestrian experience at peak times.“We know heavy traffic detracts fromenjoyment of our historic city, and can cause damage to the fragile environment and safety issues during the festivals.“Longer term, we’d expect to see an overall signicant reduction in traffic entering the Old Town at all times during the year, in line with other busy European historic cities.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots outlander fans to get chance to quiz creator diana gabaldon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Outlander fans are being offered the chance to quiz author Diana Gabaldon at a stately home that features in the hit TV show.The US writer will take part in a conversation event at Hopetoun House near South Queensferry on March .Fans will recognise the attraction from the screen adaptation of her historical time travel series, which concluded its fourth season in January.Author James Crawford will chair the evening in the Red Drawing Room, which appeared as the home of the Duke of Sandringham in series one.Outlander follows the adventures of English nurse Claire Randall, who travels back in time from s Scotland to the th century, where she meets and falls in love with Highlander Jamie Fraser.• : Outlander quiz: How well do you know the Scottish series The first book was published in  and it was adapted for television in .Fans of the series have since flocked from Europe and North America to visit locations featured in the show.The Hopetoun House event has been organised by VisitScotland and Publishing Scotland, with support from United Airlines.Jenni Steele from VisitScotland said: “The Outlander books and subsequent TV series have had a huge impact on tourism in Scotland, inspiring thousands of travellers to visit our shores.• : Outlander continues to drive record figures at Scotland’s heritage sites“It is only fitting that fans will get the chance to hear from the award-winning author in the sumptuous Hopetoun House, which will be familiar to viewers.”Marion Sinclair from Publishing Scotland added: “Books and storytelling have long been the source of cinematic and TV adaptations and Outlander is one of the major page-to-screen stories of the past decade in Scotland.“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from Diana Gabaldon about how her writing served as the inspiration for the series.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##. The document is of course the American Declaration of Independence..."},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119780.jpg","title":"5m water works plans to go on show at public event","story":"Staff ReporterScottish Water is inviting residents to attend the event at Strathdearn Millennium Hall on Wednesday.The utilityrsquos delivery alliance partner Efficient Service Deliveryhas been developing proposals for a new water treatment works to serve around  customers in the area around village.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned. We would welcome input from anyone with suitable premises or sites to get in touch so that we can make this vision a reality.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"attorney general seeks to end impasse over northern ireland backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Our primary objective is a proper analysis.”Mr Macron tore into Brexiteers on Monday, saying “anger mongers, backed by fake news, promise anything and everything”.He said: “Who told the British people the truth about their post-Brexit future  Who spoke to them about losing access to the European market  Who mentioned the risks to peace in Ireland of restoring the former border  Nationalist retrenchment offers nothing.”Indicating he will stand firm on the backstop, he said: “Our borders also need to guarantee fair competition.

A maximum bus lane speed of mph will apply.The scheme also includes iable message signs to advise when the bus lanes are in operation, upgraded CCTV and the introduction of priority signalling for buses at the Fortwilliam and Duncrue Street junctions.Stephen Pollock from the Department for Infrastructure said: “The investment reflects the Department’s policy to assist key bus and Park and Ride services on the M and M approaches to Belfast which have become some of the most congested sections of the road network, particularly at peak times.”The work to the M lanes includes a revised road layout on the approach and exit of the Belfast bound Lisburn Services , with slip roads ened to allow buses to continue on the hard shoulder and merge with traffic leaving and re-joining the motorway. Drivers and motorcyclists using the Lisburn services should take extra care as they become familiar with the new layout by checking for buses in the hard shoulder and only merging when it is safe to do so.

The success of Tucked-in Tuesdays has inevitably led to authors reaching out, with some sending books and even offering to come and read at the school.Meanwhile Dr George has extended invitations to authors to join her as guests, while one student has been so inspired that he has been writing a story for her to read.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But Dr George believes that perhaps the biggest lesson isn’t an educational one.“On Tuesdays I don’t go anywhere after I read because it would be horriblethe kids saw meI tucked them in and then I’m out!” she said. “That’s my Tucked-in-Tuesday as well. “The biggest lesson isn’t even educational, it’s that the kids know their principal cares beyond the end of the day.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier. Russell Brothers also had another great season winning the highly prized McBride Cup for the channel averages plus winning Penzance Classic.C  L Fryers had the first bird from Dromara in the Kingrsquos Cup. McKinstry Brothers had some great results along with T Marshall  Son, first bird in Penzance Young Bird, D McCandless Yearling National winner.Mr  Mrs Stevenson again did well inland as well as beating the big boys on the channel by winning first Tallbenny.H Silcock had some great positions and were unlucky to be fourth open Friendship National and still be only second in the club.After the prizes and trophies were handed out Mrs Rooney presented Fiona Stevenson with a bouquet of flowers mdash a small token of thanks for the hospitality from her and Bobby throughout the year.As usual, the highlight of the evening was the ballot and with Stanley McKinstry not attending this year his luck was taken up by Fiona Stevenson.In fact they won so many young birds Bobby thought he might not even have to breed any of his own. N Edgar  Son and N Black  Son kindly donated two young birds each.Edgarrsquos two were won by new member Chris Rooney and Mr  Mrs Stevenson and Blackrsquos two young birds were won by Gordon Kirkpatrick and Mr  Mrs Stevenson.C  l Fryersrsquo young bird was won by non-fancier William Skelly, who is putting it into the stable of N Black  Son to be raced.Cromie  Magee and Sonsrsquo was won by Russell Bros, Mr  Mrs Stevensonrsquos by Chris Rooney, Russell Bros by H Silcock, T Marshall  Sonrsquos by Mr  Mrs Stevenson and A Bradleyrsquos was won by P Connor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Conal Montgomery samples new sound  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH rocker Conal Montgomery is working on new original music for the first time in years.The well-known singer who has performed at bikersrsquo rallies and conventions around the UK for the last  years may surprise some of his fans with his new sound.Instead of the soaring progressive rock vocals he is known for, Conalrsquos new music is softer, more reflective folk style.The  year-old says that his new music is indicative of where he is in his personal le now.The  year-old explained: ldquoI havenrsquot felt like this for years particularly as when I was drinking I really couldnrsquot be bothered with writing music.ldquoI wrote songs in the early s but alcohol and drugs just took over my le and my time was wasted.ldquoFor  odd years I didnrsquot do anything and now that Irsquom sober, I just have a love for it.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
