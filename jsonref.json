I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.

(File photo)Government figures do show that the number of children born to non-UK born women increased by around 75 per cent between 2002 and 2013 - children born in these years are currently in school.This was a period of increased births overall.The DfE also gave a number of scenarios which could affect overall pupil numbers.For example, if there was high net migration, total pupil numbers (nursery, primary and secondary) could be 48,000 higher than projected by 2027 and if there was low net migration, they would be 48,000 lower.And if there were high fertility rates, numbers could be 95,000 higher and if fertility rates were low, they would be around 133,000 lower. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/21/4E2BDF6C00000578-0-image-a-2_1531426286920.jpg","title":"Woman 30 donate eggs women doesnt want contact biological children","story":"    Kerri Middleton  has been chronicling her decision to become an egg donor on TwitterFor 30-year-old Kerri’s joy was not for her own future, but for that of a woman she has never met. Because, just under a year ago, she became an egg donor, an act of pure altruism to help a childless couple be given the joy of parenthood.What’s more, she did it not as well as, but instead of, having children of her own.‘I’m not really very maternal at all — I have no real desire to have children,’ she says. ‘My two best friends have had babies and, while I am really happy for them, and the babies are gorgeous, the moment they start crying, I just want to get out of there.‘I love my career and I just don’t see children in my future. So, for me, this was a way I could help someone else have a child without having one myself. That’s actually what made it attractive to me.’It’s a laudable instinct and one that Kerri believes should be more widely shared — one reason she set up a no-holds-barred Twitter account for the duration of her egg donation journey, documenting the injections, the scans and the physical changes she underwent on her three-month egg donor ‘journey’.Every painful needle and mottled bruise, every stomach cramp and hormone surge are all carefully photographed and honestly described. It’s not easy reading, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it prompts the very obvious question: what drives a healthy, fertile young woman to put herself through this physical discomfort and mental uncertainty without the reward of a baby of her own at the end?It certainly isn’t money: in the UK, egg donors cannot be paid, although they can receive up to £750 compensation per donation cycle to cover their travel, accommodation or childcare costs. So, what was it?‘I had friends who were struggling to conceive and I had seen first-hand how desperate they were to have a child,’ says Kerri.‘My father also works as a foster carer and seeing what he does is a constant reminder of the unfairness of the world: so many people would give everything they had to have a baby, yet can’t have them — while others have them and don’t deserve them.’           Kerri Middleton was thrilled when she found out a woman she had never met was going to have a baby using eggs she donated to herKerri was also determined to spread the word on how women like her — fertile, but without maternal instincts — could help.‘When I was researching egg donation, there was lots of medical stuff to read up on, but not much from people who had actually done it,’ she says. ‘I thought the blog might be helpful — and, if it gets just one more woman to think about donating her eggs, then it has achieved something good.’There’s certainly no shortage of demand — a demand that continues to grow as more women and couples are deciding to start a family later in life, before discovering that it’s not plain sailing.The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016, almost double the number ten years earlier.Demand, however, is not matched by supply: the shortage of donor eggs has been described as ‘critical’ with many women travelling abroad in order to fulfil their dream of motherhood — leaving clinics to rely on emotion-tugging adverts to entice prospective donors.Kerri spotted just such an advert early last year while travelling on the underground in London, where she was then working.At the time Kerri, who grew up the middle child of three in Bournemouth, had a well-paid job in sales for a medical supply company, and motherhood could not have been further from her mind.Yet something about the picture of a smiling baby caught her eye. ‘Alongside it was a question about whether you had considered egg donation,’ she recalls.‘I’d never even heard of it but I was curious and it played on my mind so I did some research, read around it and the more I read the more I wanted to do something about it so I contacted the clinic and made an appointment.’And so, in early March, Kerri arrived at a small private clinic in central London for a 40-minute initial appointment.          The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016‘There was a lot of paperwork, mostly about my health and any family illnesses — which happily we don’t have. They also explained the risks and they then gave me some paperwork to look over but by then I had already made up my mind,’ she recalls.While the health risks of donating eggs appear to be few, there is a risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS), a rare but potentially severe condition that occurs when fertility medication causes too many eggs to develop in the ovaries. If not treated in time it can prove fatal.‘My view was that the risks were small — obviously with anything of this nature there is going to be some risk, but it was a calculated one.’Initially, Kerri told no one about her plans, but eventually mentioned it to a flatmate. ‘She’s very sensible — she was the one who said I needed to talk to my parents,’ she says. ‘I actually hadn’t thought about it but she was right.‘They didn’t really say much. I think they were a bit surprised but they were supportive and knew me too well to try to talk me out of it.’Over the coming days and weeks Kerri confided in other friends and colleagues. ‘Most people were fine but I was surprised by the lack of understanding around it. Some friends asked if it meant I would never be able to have kids of my own and one person asked if it meant I would go through menopause early.‘It was amazing the amount of women who didn’t even understand what happens in their own body.’The more negative reactions came from some male friends. ‘Some seemed freaked out by it. I don’t know if it was because they felt threatened by it in some way.’Because the start of the process has to be carefully timed to coincide with the start of her menstrual cycle it was not until June that Kerri —who had also received a counselling session from the clinic to ensure she was psychologically prepared — returned to start the process in earnest, receiving the kit she would need for ten days of daily injections to do at home that would stimulate her ovaries to release more eggs.‘It was actually harder than I’d been prepared for,’ she admits. ‘The way the injection was described I thought it would be a pinprick but in fact it’s a two-inch needle. I’m not good with needles at the best of times but I knew it was something I had to just get on with.’Aside from the briefly unpleasant nature of the injections, Kerri said she had few side-effects other than mild period pain, bloating and headaches.Every three days, meanwhile, she had to go to the clinic for an internal scan to check that everything was happening as it should.‘Obviously it wasn’t always convenient but then I would be in the waiting room and I would watch some lovely couple filling in paperwork and it would be a reminder of what it was all about,’ she says.Woman, 25, WINS fight to use sperm harvested from her dead...More women over 50 are choosing to have babies later as...Boys born to women who delay motherhood to put careers first...Share this articleTen days in, a scan revealed that Kerri was successfully growing healthy egg sacks, which meant she could now undergo surgery to harvest her eggs — a procedure preceded by one rather more unpleasant injection.‘I had to inject myself once a few days before surgery with what felt like a huge needle,’ she says. ‘It actually made me feel a bit sick and it took me 40 minutes to pluck up the courage to do it.’The ten-minute removal procedure under general anaesthetic took place at a clinic on London’s Harley Street on July 4 last year and Kerri admits that she had underestimated quite how daunting it would feel.‘I had felt pretty ropey in the days running up to surgery — very tired, and with really bad bloating,’ she recalls. ‘I had never had a general anaesthetic before and I think it just suddenly hit me what was happening. I did have a little cry.‘More than anything I was just anxious that they would actually recover some eggs — even if everything has been going well up to that point there are no guarantees and it would have felt awful if it was all for nothing.’In fact, she woke in the recovery room to news that doctors had harvested 16 healthy eggs. ‘I was buzzing,’ she says.‘I had honestly never felt so proud of myself. It felt so good that I had another little cry.’Sent home with what she calls a ‘mass’ of paperwork it took two days for the dizzy spells and soreness that were a consequence of the surgery to die down. ‘I had been prepared for that so although it wasn’t great it didn’t bother me,’ she says. ‘I just felt I’d done a really good thing.’Her euphoria was not to last: two weeks later she received a call from the clinic asking if she could go in to see them. ‘I wasn’t sure what to expect but when I got there I was told that half my eggs had been given to a private buyer,’ she says.‘It was a woman who didn’t live in the UK but she had bought the eggs and fertilised them with sperm she had also bought separately. Apparently the sperm was infected and the eggs had all been killed. The reason they had called me in was to ask if I would donate again.’          Kerry endured daily injections and painful operations to donate her eggs to other womenThe answer was a robust no.‘I felt pretty angry and upset, like it was a misuse of my eggs,’ she says now. ‘I understood that you don’t get a say in where your eggs go but it felt like this woman was playing God.’There were some happier tidings: the remaining eight eggs had been given to an infertile couple who had been referred to the clinic by the NHS.‘I said that I would be happy to donate again in future if all my eggs were used and they wanted a biological sibling for any baby they had.’ Kerri heard nothing further until, in April, she learned that there was a ‘live pregnancy’ from her donation.She will, subsequently, be told the date of birth and the sex.‘I was thrilled,’ she recalls. ‘I knew how excited this unknown woman must be, that she would have been on the most enormous rollercoaster to get to the point where she was carrying a baby in her tummy.‘I felt nothing but happiness for her.’ Not so her mother, however.It was at this point, with a biological grandchild growing somewhere, that Kerri’s ‘gift’ started to feel real.‘I think it did make her see things differently,’ Kerry acknowledges.‘For the first time she said she felt a bit funny about the fact that she will have a grandchild out there she may never meet.’          A pictures of a scan showing Kerri\u0027s eggs which she goes through daily injections so she can donate themBut from Kerri? Nothing else? Not a twinge of curiosity, or a pang of longing for a child that is genetically at least, half hers? Not at all, she insists.‘Whether it’s a boy or a girl makes no difference to me’ she says.‘I don’t feel it’s my baby. The way I see it is that there was a couple who desperately wanted to get to an airport to go on holiday but they couldn’t find a car to take them there. I provided the car.‘So I helped them to their destination but their life there is nothing to do with me.’ The baby, of course, may see it differently: since the law changed in 2005 all donors in the UK are required to sign a register containing their contact details and babies born as a result of egg donation are allowed to access information about their donor when they turn 18.It means that some day, nearly two decades from now, Kerri may receive an email, or a knock at the door, from her biological son or daughter. ‘I am open to that but it is not something I worry about either,’ she says. It will, of course, be fascinating to see if she feels the same way in five years time — or if it impacts on future relationships.Currently single, might a future partner find it hard to accept that his girlfriend’s offspring is out there somewhere unknown to her.‘I actually don’t worry about that — for me I think the bigger conversation is the fact I don’t want children,’ she says.‘It’s a hard conversation to have.‘All I know is that there are women out there right now who are yearning to carry their own baby. I’m not one of them — but I have helped someone who couldn’t’.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/01/4E2DEEC300000578-0-image-a-5_1531440392606.jpg","title":"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich puts UK visa worries aside kits 30m London penthouse","story":"    Abramovich has bagged the penthouse at this Chelsea Waterfront development for £30million          The Chelsea owner\u0027s apartment is the biggest of 75 in the development and he has a team of interior designers fitting it out The 51-year-old is said to have given up on the application and obtained an Israeli passport that allows short trips to London despite having no visa, The Times reports.  Father-of-seven Abramovich was the first big Russian name to withdraw his investments in Britain as tensions between President Putin and Theresa May\u0027s government worsened.Plans for a £1billion redevelopment of Chelsea\u0027s ground were halted last month as the club cited the \u0027current unfavourable investment climate\u0027.

Please enjoy the lake in a civilised way.\u0027           Apparently, such behaviour happens every year. The above picture shows tourists  in 2013          In 2013 (pictured), loudspeakers were used to tell people not to put their feet into West LakeAfter the latest videos were shared on Chinese social media this week, web users have expressed different point of views. Some said the act spoiled the picturesque scenery and turned the celebrated lake into a \u0027public feet-washing basin\u0027.While others argued that the habit of washing or bathing in public had been observed for centuries, and it did not cause harm the environment.A trending hashtag, called \u0027West Lake becomes a feet-washing basin\u0027, has gathered more than 960,000 views on Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter.Some users considered the action \u0027obscene\u0027 and \u0027indecent\u0027 and compared it to graffiti vandalism.One such commentator, who claimed to be a Hangzhou resident, stressed that West Lake is not a public bathhouse, but a scenic spot.Another user, clearly upset by the tourists, wrote: \u0027The fish are going to die because of their smelly feet.\u0027On the other hand, there are also many people who did not see it as a problem at all. They claimed that it was a normal way for people to relax at the tourist spot. One even said that he \u0027did it all the time\u0027 when he was a child and was never caught.\u0027As long as they didn\u0027t fall into the lake, what\u0027s wrong with putting their feet in the water?\u0027 A user called \u0027XibianrichuV\u0027 said.  Some web users said tourists should visit the lake in a civilised way, while other didn\u0027t see it as a problem at all. The foot-washing trend in West Lake can be traced back as far as 2013Some emphasised those tourists did not bring any harm to the environment or pollute the water, therefore it should be within their rights to do so.\u0027If this can easily pollute the lake, Mother Nature could have died long time ago,\u0027 wrote \u0027Linglingzifeng\u0027.In fact, chief officer Miao Qitao at West Lake Waters Management told People\u0027s Daily that West Lake could purify the water itself.\u0027We started a programme to grow seaweed at the bottom of the lake in order to cleanse the water in 2011. \u0027The water quality is improving year by year thanks to the 31-hectare seaweed planted under the water.\u0027West Lake was listed as an UNESCO world heritage site in 2011. The committee praised the area\u0027s beautiful scenery and the inspiration it had provided to painters and poets.The lake, decorated with numerous temples, pagodas, and gardens, inspires people to \u0027project feelings onto the landscape\u0027, stated the UNESCO committee.West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou - UNESCO World Heritage Centre"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/26/14/499AB2AB00000578-0-image-m-9_1519655967278.jpg","title":"How answer whats biggest weakness job interview","story":"    Difficult: Many interviewees know the question might be coming - but can often find it incredibly hard to answer coherently However, interviewers are looking to see how you handle the pressure of this broad question – and a solid answer could help you stand out from the other candidates.In the latest This is Money interview cheat sheet, we ask an expert for his advice on how to answer and also the right way to approach the opposite end of the question – what is your biggest strength.James Innes, who offers CV services and has written a number of books on all aspects of the employment search, reveals all below...\u0027So, tell me about yourself\u0027: Experts reveal their top tips...How to nail a job interview outside the office comfort zone:...It\u0027s a no brainer ¿ let\u0027s just touch base and punch a puppy:...Youngest boss of a British public company took JUST two...Share this articleTHREE KEY REASONS FOR WEAKNESS QUESTIONWith a question like \u0027what are you weaknesses\u0027 the interviewer wants to achieve the following three things:Identify any weakness which might actually be detrimental to your ability to undertake the role.See how you react when faced with a somewhat tricky question.Assess how self-aware you are and how you define weakness.Bear this in mind when it comes to answering - it is always handy to know what the interviewer is trying establish in order to tackle the problem head on.ARROGANT TO SAY \u0027NO\u0027 WEAKNESSESThere is the temptation to say you quite simply don\u0027t have any weaknesses. But this is definitely not the answer the interviewer is looking for.  Therefore it is not the answer you should be giving.If you honestly don\u0027t think you have any weaknesses then you risk coming across as arrogant if you say so – and nobody wants a perfect candidate anyway.          Don\u0027t let it throw you off balance: There are a number of ways to tackle this tricky questionTURN IT ROUND TO YOUR ADVANTAGEWhile this is a somewhat negative question, it is in fact full of opportunities for you to turn it round to your advantage and make your answer a positive point.Don\u0027t be perturbed by the question or let it throw you off balance. Your answer should be right on the tip of your tongue – because we will work on it right now.The first thing to make clear is that you should only ever discuss a \u0027professional\u0027 weakness, unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise, which is extremely unlikely.In a nutshell, the interviewer wants to know that you are able to look at yourself objectively and criticise yourself where appropriate.TWO CHOICES TO TAKE WHEN ANSWERINGYou don\u0027t just want to come up with a straightforward list of what you consider your weaknesses to be. You basically have two choices:- Talk about a weakness that\u0027s not necessarily a weakness at all.- Talk about a weakness that you turned (or can turn) into a strength.The problem with the first option is that you risk running into serious cliché territory. I\u0027m talking about the kind of people who answer:- I would have to say that my main weakness is that I\u0027m a perfectionist.- I have a reputation for working too hard I often push myself far too hard in my work.You risk sounding like you plucked your answer straight out of a 1990s manual on interview technique.Personally, I prefer the second option: Talk about a weakness that you turned - or are turning - into a strength.You are answering the interviewer\u0027s question by highlighting a definite weakness, but you then go on to reflect positively on this by outlining the active steps you have taken or are taking to overcome it.You are demonstrating a willingness to learn, adapt and improve and that you have the initiative required to make changes where changes are due.Choosing a weakness that has its root in lack of experience and therefore has been (or is being) overcome by further training is ideal because it is a weakness that is relatively easily resolved.      £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroadJames Innes Group of CV Consultants - The James Innes Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/03/4DF68EE100000578-0-image-m-13_1530843377347.jpg","title":"Black man told leave pool apartment complex Indianapolis","story":"Black woman films angry white motorist calling 911 on her...Black 12-year-old boy mowing lawns for the summer has the...\u0027Permit Patty\u0027 DID call the cops: Newly released 911 call...Outrage after black Oakland firefighter on property...Share this articleSpeaking to WRTV, he said he \u0027didn\u0027t want to jump to racism\u0027, but couldn\u0027t help but notice he was the only black person at the pool and had been the only one ejected.Barrett \u0026amp Stokely, the company that manages the River Crossing complex, said they were taking Holland\u0027s claims seriously and continuing to investigate.Candace, the property manager, has been placed on leave pending the results of an investigation.   \u0027We are disappointed that we weren\u0027t able to handle this situation in a way in which everyone felt respected and understood,\u0027 a statement shared to social media read.\u0027We should have communicated with all residents that we would have security on site, who would be asking for proof of residency.\u0027  Holland refused to give a security guard (left) his exact address because he says she had not properly identified herself, and when his property manager Candace (right) arrived on the scene and confirmed he was a resident, she asked him to leave for not complying with the guard          Instead of giving the guard his address, he showed her his key to the pool area to prove he lived there (pictured).

He succeeded just in time: the manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say that he wouldn’t keep them for another day.‘If they don’t leave tomorrow, we’ll have to shoot them,’ he said. The next day, he called again. ‘We had some trouble with the matriarch,’ he said without preamble. ‘I shot her. She’s a bloody nightmare and would have broken out of your reserve and flattened someone. I took out the baby, too.’I was beside myself with anger and despair.Even I knew that a herd’s matriarch is their teacher, referee, keeper of memories, travel guide and bush stateswoman rolled into one.‘This is bad, Frankie, really bad,’ Lawrence said to me. ‘How the hell did he think this poor herd would cope after losing their leader? He probably shot the matriarch right in front of them.’I began to worry even more about what we were taking on.The herd had already been in a bad way, and now they’d be even more traumatised — but without a leader to calm them. In the middle of that night, in torrential rain, the seven other elephants arrived in three huge articulated trucks. Two breeding adult females, two teenagers, and three little ones under the age of ten.          The manager of the land where the elephants were roaming phoned to say he had killed the matriarch just days before the adoption          They led the elephants into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence - but they weren\u0027t there for longMy heart froze at their terrified trumpeting and screeching as we struggled to get them into a temporary enclosure, protected by a new electrified fence.They weren’t there for long.By the next day, they’d worked out that pushing a nine-metre tree onto the electric fence would cause the wires to short. And off they went, heading northwards in the direction of their previous home. Hundreds of villages dot the hills and valleys around our game reserve in Zululand, so we knew there was every chance they’d be killed.You’d think it would be easy to find a herd of elephants, but it isn’t. For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did at last get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped again.By then, it was clear that a new matriarch — whom we called Nana — had taken over, but the elephants were still deeply distressed. Drawing on his instincts, Lawrence did what he could to reassure them. Night after night, he stayed as close to the flimsy wires as he dared, singing to them, talking to them and telling them stories until he was hoarse.He was utterly determined to breach their terror of man.One hot afternoon, he came home and said: ‘You won’t believe what happened. Nana put her trunk through the fence and touched my hand.’ My eyes widened in shock. Nana could easily have slung her trunk around his body and yanked him through the wires.‘Please get out of this alive,’ I begged.          For ten days, they managed to evade trackers on foot, in 4x4s and helicopters. And when we did get them back, we were warned by the authorities that they’d be shot if they escaped againThe next day, Lawrence released the herd into the game reserve. I was terrified he would be trampled to death, but day after day he tracked them and crept as close as he dared. His efforts didn’t go unnoticed by Nana, who started trying to protect him from the rest of the herd.Eventually, they developed a secret way of meeting.Lawrence would park his battered Land Rover half a kilometre away from the elephants and wait until Nana caught his scent in the air.Then she’d quietly separate from the others and amble towards him through the scrub, her trunk held high to show her delight.She would then swoop it all over him, with delicate touches with the tip, as he told her about his life — and Nana would respond with throaty rumbles.So how did it all start? Even now, I often gaze out into the bush, reflecting on how a chance meeting completely changed my life.Back then, I’d been a 33-year-old who worked for a chamber of commerce.In London for a trade show, I was standing in the taxi queue outside the Cumberland Hotel, running out of time to get to an appointment. The hotel porter asked if I’d be happy to share a cab with another guest, but I shook my head. I wasn’t in the mood for a chat with a tourist who’d dressed in white summer trousers and a blue plastic windcheater on a freezing winter’s day.My rudeness didn’t go unpunished, because half an hour later I still hadn’t managed to find a cab. Going back into the hotel to warm up, I bumped into the tourist.          Françoise met her husband Lawrence while in London for a trade show. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on businessMortified, I offered to show him how to get to where he wanted on the Tube. The oddly dressed man, I discovered, was South African and in London on business. Somehow I ended up inviting him to join me at a jazz club that evening.And that was that, until one day the man announced that he was coming to visit me. As I was later to find out, flying more than 6,000 miles for a date was typical behaviour of Lawrence: he was bold, impulsive and never let anything stop him. A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for good.Needless to say, my friends thought I was out of my mind, but I knew I just had to be with this wonderful, funny, crazy man. It was that simple. His enthusiasm for life was infectious, convincing me we could do absolutely anything at all if we wanted it enough.Share this articleAnd let’s face it, our decision to give up a comfortable city life in Durban to buy 3,700 acres in KwaZulu-Natal was pretty mad. Lawrence’s plan was to convince tribal elders to add on their own surrounding lands, to turn the reserve into a massive conservation area. And that’s exactly what came to pass.Protecting the animals cost a fortune, of course, but we built an upmarket ‘eco-tourism’ lodge, with seven chalets, and were soon welcoming paying guests from around the world.We called the reserve Thula Thula — ‘thula’ is Zulu for ‘quiet’ — because it suggested peace and tranquillity. Not that it was ever totally quiet: at night, we’d sit on our veranda, listening to the soft grunts, squeals, whistles and chirrups of countless animals, birds and insects.          A few months later, I boarded a flight to South Africa and, a year after our first meeting, I gave up my job and my flat and moved there for goodA year after the elephants arrived, we tried to rescue a fourth female. We’d been alerted to her plight by Dr Marion Garaï, a researcher who has studied elephants for more than 30 years.This particular one was aged 12. She’d been part of a group of seven orphans, but her owner had got fed up with them and dumped them on various reserves. To Marion’s horror, she discovered that the young elephant had been alone for a whole year — which is comparable to abandoning a 12-year-old human child.What happened next was shameful: before we could do anything, her owner had auctioned her to the highest bidder, an American hunter.‘Apparently the hunter’s in a wheelchair, so I suppose a frightened young elephant without a herd to protect her is the only way he’s going to get his trophy,’ said Marion bitterly.We were devastated.Here was a young elephant who’d lost her family, not once but twice, who’d been shifted from one reserve to another and condemned to a solitary miserable life — and now her beautiful face was going to end up above some American’s fireplace.Only a miracle, we felt, could save her. And, amazingly, in March 2000, it came through.Her American owner’s application for a new hunting permit was denied. We never found out why, and we didn’t care.          By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21But our problems weren’t over.The regional authorities had heard that our little elephant was ‘trouble’ and refused to grant us the necessary permit for her removal.At this point, Marion — who’d never met the animal — risked her professional credibility to swear the troubled little elephant would be fine.But would she? What if our own herd rejected her?Lawrence was certain they had too much compassion for that. ‘They’ve been through what she’s been through,’ he said. ‘They know the horror of having their families shot in front of them.’Finally, the permit was approved, and the little one arrived at Thula Thula. We put her straight into an enclosure and Lawrence set up camp outside it.She hated his presence, charging him every time he approached the wires. Animosity and fear turned her eyes black with rage.We christened her ET — short for enfant terrible.‘She’s had so much trauma packed into that little life of hers,’ said Lawrence. ‘We’re not going to give up on her now.’ET’s rage was terrifying enough, but then it turned into the deepest despair. The unfamiliar territory, scary new smells and terrifying humans were too much.She stopped eating, no longer bothered to charge Lawrence, and just walked around and around in listless circles. ET had given up. What could we do? You can’t hug an angry elephant. Lawrence would have camped beside her for months if he’d thought that would help, but ET looked as if she’d lost the will to live.‘We’ve got to get Nana here,’ he said. ‘If she doesn’t get company soon, she’s going to die of heartbreak.’Using food and sweet talk, he lured the herd from miles away to ET’s enclosure.What happened next was extraordinary.The minute Nana and another older female, Frankie, set eyes on the frightened elephant child, they lumbered up to the fence and started talking to her, floating their trunks between the wires to touch her.          On March 1, she was alone at Thula Thula as Lawrence was away on business. The next day she got a phone call telling her he had died of a heart attack ET stared at them, transfixed. They were the first elephants she’d seen in a year. Tentatively, she raised her trunk to theirs. Quiet rumbles rolled between them. Even our macho rangers were wiping their eyes.Then the rest of the herd came closer to say ‘hello’.‘I think they’re reassuring her,’ murmured one of the Zulu rangers. ‘They’re probably telling her their story — that they, too, lost their families and know what it’s like to be frightened and alone. They’re saying: “You’re going to be fine. We’ll walk with you.” ’ I choked back tears, hoping with all my heart that he was right.It was time to open the gate between the enclosure and the reserve, to let ET join the herd.At first, she kept walking past the open gate, unsure of what to do. Nana and Frankie milled about, trying to show her where to go. But still ET hadn’t twigged she was free to leave.Eventually, when the herd began to lumber off, she let out a strangled cry.‘Oh my God! The poor thing has no voice,’ said LawrenceWe later learned that after ET had lost her companions in her previous home, she’d shrieked herself hoarse and permanently damaged her vocal cords. To this day, she can only squeeze out strangled honking noises.Just as we were about to give up and close the gate again, ET paused in front of it, her eyes on the disappearing elephants, and walked straight through.The herd accepted her with tenderness and compassion, ensuring that for her first few months of freedom, she was never left alone.By 2012, 13 years after the arrival of the elephants, the herd had swelled from seven to 21. On March 1, I was alone at Thula Thula. Lawrence was away on business, though calling me frequently because he was worried about a storm heading our way.When the phone rang at 7am the following morning, I assumed it would be him. Instead, it was a voice telling me that my indestructible husband had died of a heart attack during the night.I didn’t believe it. I sank onto our bed, numb with shock. How could I survive without him?We loved each other we’d been partners in everything. We’d learned on the hop, tackling each challenge that came our way with courage, craziness and plenty of laughter. And now, from one day to the next, he was just gone. It was unthinkable. I stumbled through that day and the next in a daze.          Very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge. I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from usThen, very early the following morning, a ranger called to say that the herd were heading towards the lodge.I was flabbergasted. The last sighting of them had been during the worst of the storm alerts, when they’d been a good 12 hours’ walk from us.Soon, the herd was right at the back gate. Even the bulls were there — unusual, because bachelor elephants tend to stay away from the others, or at least out of sight.Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. They hardly ever visited the lodge, unless they had a new baby to introduce to us, and then they’d stand peacefully grazing, gently nudging the new arrival forward to meet Lawrence.This time, however, all 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back again.On their faces — even those of the babies — I could see the telltale streaks of anxiety.An elephant’s temporal gland, which sits between its eyes and ears, secretes liquid when the animal is stressed, which can create the mistaken impression that it’s crying.So they weren’t crying — I knew that — but the moist dark lines running down their massive cheeks showed that something had deeply affected them.After about 40 minutes, they lined up at the fence that separates our home from the bush.Suddenly, solemn rumbles rolled through the air, the same low-frequency language they’d always used with Lawrence.Nana, alone, stopped pacing and stood still. It was almost as if she were waiting for Lawrence to appear, yet aware that he wasn’t there.          Other aspects of the elephants’ behaviour were out of character, too. All 21 of them were jostling about at the gate, clearly agitated. Restless, they walked in a jumble to the front of the lodge, stayed there for a few minutes, then paced round to the back againWe hadn’t seen the herd in months. Why had they come — and why were they so anxious?Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has died.On the first anniversary of Lawrence’s death, I organised a simple memorial service and then headed reluctantly for Durban for a week crammed with appointments.At the end of my first day back in the city, I opened a text from one of our rangers.‘They’re at the main house!’ it said. Who? What did he mean? Had I missed a meeting? I clicked open the photos he’d attached.And there was the entire elephant herd, surrounding my house at Thula Thula.Their backs glistened like ebony in the fading light. I was stunned.To the exact day, it was a year since they’d turned up just after Lawrence’s death. And every one of us who works at Thula Thula knew why they’d come.Elephants mourn their dead for a long time. Years after one of our old bulls died, the herd would keep returning to the spot where his bones lay and linger for hours, dark streaks lining their cheeks, as they gently touched his remains.And now these beautiful, sensitive creatures were doing exactly what we’d done two days earlier: they were marking Lawrence’s death in their own way.  Science has no answers, but to me their visit made perfect sense. When my husband’s heart stopped, something stirred in theirs, and they crossed miles and miles of wilderness to mourn with us, to pay their respects, just as they do when one of their own has diedHis ashes had long since been absorbed by the earth, leaving them with nothing physical to touch and revere. So, instead, they’d returned to where Lawrence had lived.Never in a million years did I think I’d have another chance at love.But a few years after Lawrence’s death, I met a gentle, silver-haired man called Clément who completely understood what Thula Thula meant to me.One weekend, we both joined a couple of people who were going for a game-drive in our Land Cruiser. Suddenly, we saw the elephants coming towards us along a dirt track.My heart thudded as they ambled towards us.Frankie and Nana were in the lead, the other mums behind them with their little ones holding onto their tails, and trailing further back were the bulls.To my astonishment, the oldest bull, Gobisa, walked straight up to Clément and stopped in front of him.We held our breath as the elephant’s huge body blocked out the sky. Leaning his massive forehead against the Land Cruiser’s canopy, he started gently prodding Clément’s side with his tusks. Next, he fluttered his trunk tenderly over his chest, before going on to explore his cheeks, nose and hair.As we started up the engine and prepared to leave, Gobisa finally stepped back. But he continued to study my new man, returning to touch him one last time before sauntering off.My Zulu rangers had no difficulty in interpreting the elephant’s behaviour.As the herd’s oldest bull, Gobisa had simply been checking out my new mate, making sure he was a worthy successor to their beloved Lawrence.Adapted by Corinna Honan from An Elephant In My Kitchen by Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen, published by Sidgwick \u0026amp Jackson on July 26 at £16.99. © 2018 Françoise Malby-Anthony \u0026amp Katja Willemsen.

He discusses the ‘cult’ of Catholicism, his love of poetry and giving up his vices“I’ve been doing this for a quarter of a century,” points out Dylan Moran. “I’m probably going to know about as much as I’m ever going to know on a working level. There’s a liberty in that.” It’s hard to believe so much time has passed since the Irish comic first shuffled on to the stage, cigarette and drink at the ready, and appeared not to know what on earth he was doing there. In 1996, aged 24, he became the youngest person to win the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh festival, and embarked on his first UK tour the year after. TV and film opportunities followed, often playing various iterations of his rumpled, grumpy stage persona: in the 1998 sitcom How Do You Want Me?, with the late Charlotte Coleman a cameo as a shameless shoplifter in the Richard Curtis film Notting Hill roles in the Simon Pegg vehicles Shaun of the Dead and Run, Fatboy, Run. More recently he’s appeared in the 2014 Irish film Calvary and the TV sitcom Uncle.But the show he remains best known for is cult favourite Black Books, co-created with Graham Linehan, in which Moran took centre stage as the operatically bad-tempered secondhand bookshop owner Bernard Black, a petty tyrant to his sweet-natured assistant, played by Bill Bailey. An extended love letter to booze, fags, dusty bookshops and stubborn iniduality, it ran for three series, from 2000 to 2004, and still inspires enormous affection.Drinking coffee in a London cafe on the same street where he worked on the show, Moran ascribes viewers’ love for Bernard to the fact that “he does what you want to do. He’s a refusenik child, he’s the child who doesn’t want to get out of bed. We all have a bit of that in us. Basically, Grumpy Cat stole my act.”Moran’s standup act has remained much the same over the decades: bumbling, hesitating, getting snarled up in microphone leads wandering off on surreal flights of fancy and gently charming the audience with routines about the differences between the sexes or the ridiculousness of Game of Thrones before dropping in a casual reminder that we’re all just “hot fleas in the gulping dark”. (On his 2015 tour he reduced life to four stages: “Child, failure, old, dead.”) Over the past few years he’s been travelling widely, “riding the jetstream of English as a world language” to Scandinavia and the Baltic states, as well as becoming the first English-speaking comic to perform in Russia in 2012.“The first few jokes were in Russian, messing around. I said, ya shpion, which means I’m a spy, vy shpion, you’re a spy too, I can tell. It’s nonsense, but you’ve got to come from nowhere, talking through the stereotypes and all the cultural baggage we have.” Gags about homophobic laws and an imprisoned oil tycoon may have been lost in translation: “I think there was some censorship going on,” he admits.His interest in global touring stems from seeing parallels between cultures. “I was always fascinated by eastern Europe growing up, because they were like us. A certain kind of isolation. Ireland was just this weird hangover of old-fashioned religiosity.” As an only child in Navan, Co Meath, growing up in the 1970s and 80s, his was one of the very few families not to go to church, giving Moran an early lesson in non-compliance.The saturation of religion – “it was everywhere, it was in your soup” – meant that he “didn’t have a great time” at school, and left at 16. “It was very church-oriented. Once you have the education system, you have everything. I’m very anti the whole jokey ‘Ah sure, isn’t it just Ireland, and the priests were part of the landscape’. I still think there should be a lot more reparations. It was a cult! And for women it was absolutely apocalyptic.” He settled in Edinburgh 20 years ago with his Scottish script editor wife Elaine, where they have raised two children.Even after escaping school, Moran’s late teens were miserable. “I was trying to figure out what the hell to do. I didn’t have any qualifications and I was pretty desperate. I wrote, I read, I bit my nails. I was kind of worried that I wasn’t more worried – I was a bit of a slacker about it. But it did give me time to think.” When he got to Dublin and tried standup, “It was like a throwing my cards in the air type of thing – trying on a suit that fits and it’s just perfect.”And the turbo-charged reading jag of those teenage years had laid down the literary seam that nourishes his comedy. Those artful hesitations and the gleeful dyspepsia share DNA with Beckett’s rambling, rumbling voices in the dark, while the surreal inventiveness and wordplay echo the spiky humour of Flann O’Brien. Moran was also an obsessive play reader, forging his dramatic sensibility and sense of timing without leaving his bedroom (“comedy is all about the ision of time, rhythms, the fall of language”). He remembers his father handing him Pinter at 15 he then flew through “all Ibsen, all Chekhov, Edward Bond – I’d even read all Noël Coward”. These days, though he tips his hat at Edward St Aubyn (“he’s our Waugh”) and is intrigued by Nicola Barker, he reads only poetry: Charles Simic, Frederick Seidel, Fiona Sampson, Sharon Olds.“Publishing should wake up to the fact that people’s attention loops are shrinking by the second,” he says. “Sell poetry as a hit, the way you sell coffee or chilli: you get a linguistic bang off this thing.” He has put out pamphlets of his own poems (“vanity publishing, self-published, whatever you want to call it”) and also posts them on Instagram, along with the trippy cartoons that form the backdrop to his live shows. “They’re just jingles and doodles, but people like them. It’s like a clearing desk. Every day I write, every day I draw. It’s all I’ve got.”The verbal fun of standup is much more like poetry than prose, he says, “because a lot of it is about elision, suggestion, inference, the white space around the words. They’re much closer than people think, poetry and jokes. Look at haiku, koans … dense, rich word forms. That’s where I live. I live in that.”In fact, Moran spent a long time feeling guilty that his love of standup was getting in the way of a literary career. “For years, I thought oh, this is terribly annoying, I’m on stage, I should be writing books, I should be staying at home and not leaving the house.” After decades of promising that a book was in the pipeline, he has finally realised that “I don’t have to write novels. What a terrible problem to have, eh?” He laughs at his own ridiculousness. “‘I feel so liberated now I’ve cast off that yoke of having to produce novels!’ My novel hell, I should call my memoir.”At 46, he feels “out of a rut” in more ways than one. Booze and fags were fuel for his early standup and louche persona, the drunken Irishman act a way to grab audience attention as well as calm his nerves. But now, having quit cigarettes four years ago – “smoking or breathing, one of them had to go” – he’s recently taken a “little holiday” from alcohol, a dry January that has kept going into May (and enabled him to “lose 485 pounds and extend each day to last 385,000 hours”). “You’re sort of embarrassed that you’re still the same person because you invested so much of yourself in the vice,” he says. “It’s incredible what you can give up, really.”The new show, Dr Cosmos, which is touring the UK this autumn, is about “the bonfire of now. The blazing relentlessness and the effect it has on you. How do you sit still without coming apart at the seams?” Middle age tends to accelerate the conviction that the world is going to hell in a handcart, but Moran points to “a massive consensus: we’re all agreed that the world is indeed fucked right now. Everyone knows that the American president is a ludicrous person, in this country we’ve got two zombie political parties having a pretend show of political debate that’s never going to lead to anything, and Britain is going through this extraordinary act of sending itself to its room and not coming down as a show of – what? You shat your pants in front of the whole world and you’re sulking?“It’s embarrassed by its own behaviour, frankly, and it’s a postcolonial sulk. Everybody’s just looking around, waiting for the embarrassment to fade. But Britain has this tradition of carrying on resolutely, because you’re committed to something, and is therefore locked into a position where it has to be seen to execute the absurdity it doesn’t want to go through with. These are desperate times.” Whereas in the past he often wrote shows out “like a book”, this year, “for the first time really, I’m not banking on having everything written up. I’m realising – and I really am just realising this now, I’m very thick, really –that I really am working in an oral tradition. So I am going to talk it. It’s like going back to when I began: sometimes I just talked because I didn’t know how you did standup.”Moran has always been unwilling to “dissect the fairy of comedy”, but with 25 years of experience under his belt he underlines that it’s about recognition – “people are amazed if you anticipate their experience” – and heart. “People forget how much gut is involved in it, how much your kishkas are involved. All this frontal, verbal, parlour game bullshit in British comedy is so boring and sounds like fucking Punch from 1850. It’s oppressive to any vigour and having a voice. If you listen to new British music, grime, how younger people speak: where’s the mainstream comedy reflecting those voices?“What really makes me laugh more than anything in the world,” he concludes, “is when somebody you love impersonates you. You are seen. You are shown back to yourself 3D, in the round, in motion, the dynamic of you. That’s what I want for an audience. I want them to feel that they have been seen. And I want to show them back to themselves.”• Dylan Moran: Dr Cosmos will be at the Edinburgh festival fringe in August, and then touring the UK from September 2018. dylanmoran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bcfa7f1724b6a65dac985965f1b10cb0c90dc08/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43953fa3241fbe31c873dfe4b67a614","title":"build a bear workshop bargain discount teddy","story":"Those of us fortunate enough to live through the heady days of the Hoover free-flights fiasco thought we would never see the like again. Imagine this, people of a younger vintage: 25 years ago, some guys in marketing came up with a terrific wheeze. Buy a new vacuum cleaner, they said, and if it’s worth over £100 we’ll give you two free return flights. To the United States.Cue a run on Hoovers, which some customers wanted so little that they abandoned them in the store the minute they had the receipt in their hot little hands, and enough hopeful holiday-makers to fill\u0026nbsp500 jumbo jets. Needless to say, it did not end well.At least this week’s ill-thought-through promotion was quicker to unravel. Here’s how it went: a company called Build-A-Bear Workshop invited children in the UK and the US to its shops, where they could choose, stuff and customise their own teddy bear. Sweet! But probably quite expensive, no? No. Not if you availed yourself of the special “pay your age” offer. It’s as simple as it sounds: if you’re five, it costs a fiver, and so forth.But in a (mercifully, less violent) echo of the 2005 opening of Ikea in Tottenham, north London, in which thousands stampeded in pursuit of cheap sofas, there was a miscalculation. More or less instantly, demand outstripped supply queues multiplied, as queues do tempers frayed children wept as they were carted off home, sans bear. From the Birmingham Bullring to Meadowhall in Sheffield, from Telford to Milton Keynes, it was a truly bad bear day.Hoovers and sofas show us these cock-ups are nothing new. But they have a different feel in an era when the physical high street or shopping centre is under constant pressure from wily online retailers and the spectre of rising business rates.

Why so popular, I wondered, until I\u0026nbspcame across the concept of bottomless brunch – a deal in which you get to jam as much prosecco as you like\u0026nbspdown\u0026nbspyour neck as long as you order a cheese\u0026nbspomelette.It’s limited to a certain time period, as rowing on boating lakes used to be. But clearly, the model only works if your punters are not prodigiously thirsty and in possession of hollow legs. Which, basically, describes an awful lot of British people. Whether or not it was the Saturday morning sozzlers that did for the restaurant, I\u0026nbspcannot say, but it isn’t there any more.Food, drink, nail art – these are the fundamental experiences we cannot replicate virtually (yet). But if you walk down a high street with 17 coffee shops and 43\u0026nbspmanicurists, you’re going to need something to make your macchiato or full-set-and-gel stand out. If you’re a toyshop, and have the full armoury of the internet against you, the ante’s upped once again.So how, in modern-day parlance, can we take the positives from the teddy trauma? One parent, who took her five-year-old out of classes for the day because “they’re not really doing much in school that’s important at that age”, was perhaps more on the money\u0026nbspthan she realised. True enough, her daughter might have missed out on some crucial key stage 1 action, but think of what she learned from the University\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspLife\u0026nbsp– and, indeed, the famous School of\u0026nbspHard Knocks.She learned about the importance of detailed planning and the need for contingency arrangements about the speed with which a group of people in a previously orderly civic space can morph into a baying mob about the range of human behaviours, from acceptance to sheer, glassy-eyed venality.Perhaps most important, she learned about disappointment: how it wrenches your guts but must be faced down as quickly as possible. For what is worse than festering disappointment, as Boris Johnson will soon have cause to wonder? In our testing times, there is surely no age too tender to begin that lesson.Meanwhile, a lucky shopper had other problems to contend with. Yes, she confided, she had indeed got a bear. The trouble was, she’d waited for so long that any savings she had made were offset by the parking charges\u0026nbspshe’d incurred. And that might be the most important takeaway from this sorry saga: you think you’ve beaten the system, but the parking will always get you in the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ea474c9d4df1a97994d4612c60964fb340743a/0_70_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e98b91b423366b2f54710403cfd87b1c","title":"tory brexiteers plan 2019 britain conservative","story":"It’s a truth pretty universally acknowledged that the reason the Conservative government has struggled to come up with an agreed negotiating position in the wake of the country voting for Brexit is that many Tories who campaigned for leave didn’t really think they’d win the referendum. Even those who dared to dream were determined not to muddy their “take back control” messaging by getting dragged into discussing precisely how they’d go about it.But there was another reason behind their reluctance to talk about what came next – the fact that the UK’s departure from the European Union will necessitate a change to the country’s political economy that risks proving as electorally unpopular as it will be profound. This is the love that dare not speak its name – at least until March 2019, when we are suddenly likely to start hearing a whole lot more about it.For the party’s hyperglobalists, Brexit doesn’t just mean Brexit. It means a leaner, meaner Britain where the costs – financial and otherwise – of doing business are lowered in order to allow companies, and the country, to compete on the world stage.This means cutting both tax and public services. State provision, after all, is deemed by its very nature to be a vested interest, inefficient and inferior to what markets can be enabled to provide. It also stymies incentives toward entrepreneurialism and creates welfare dependencies – as well as crowding out private (and charitable) sector activity.Brexit also means cutting what these true believers like to call “red tape”. Indeed, one of the main reasons for wanting out of the EU, as well as the opportunity to do trade deals of our own, is the desire to escape the externally imposed regulation that supposedly hobbles and handicaps us in the so-called global race. No matter that the UK already has a relatively easy-hire, easy-fire culture – it needs to be even more dynamic.So, what is this guide to how the UK can rebirth itself – primarily by learning, not so much from European countries (unless, of course, they are busy cutting welfare entitlements and making their labour markets more flexible) but from Asian dynamos such as South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as places such as Brazil and Israel? It is – and maybe the title tells you all you need to know – Britannia Unchained. Its authors? Rising stars of the parliamentary Conservative party.True, a couple of them have a lower profile than the others, although Kwasi Kwarteng is parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor, and Chris Skidmore has just been put in charge of a new policy commission set up by Theresa May. True, too, that one of them, leave cheerleader and disgraced former international development secretary Priti Patel, has recently crashed to earth. But the other two are definitely making their mark: uber-Thatcherite Liz Truss is now chief secretary to the Treasury, and hard Brexiteer Dominic Raab has just been appointed secretary of state for exiting the European Union.Their recent rise to power does not represent the success of some carefully planned conspiracy to hijack the Tory party hatched in 2012, when their book was originally published. But it does provide strong clues as to the direction it may take after 2019 – presuming, of course, that the UK does actually manage to formally extract itself from the EU by that date.We need those clues precisely because those responsible for steering the Conservatives’, and therefore the country’s, course from then on have been so coy with “the people” in whose name the referendum was fought and won.If this is more than a little ironic, it is also understandable: after all, there is little or no evidence from opinion research that their prospectus for post-Brexit Britain would find many takers. This is true even among the famous 17.4 million who voted leave in 2016 – particularly if, along with shrinking the state, it also means an end (which if free marketeers are consistent it certainly should do) to migration targets.Does this disjunction between what “the people” currently say they want and what they supposedly need actually bother Tory hyperglobalists, except insofar as it prevents them, at least for the moment, from revealing all?No – the reason being that they are Leninists, in the same way that Margaret Thatcher, their inspiration and icon, was a Leninist. Just like her, in 1979, they believe they know what we want better than we do ourselves right now. And just like her, they have a crusading vision whose details, inasmuch as they’ve been fully worked out, are best kept under wraps until the time is right and we can be made to realise – they hope gratefully rather than grudgingly – that there truly is no alternative.• Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3f602dffee4cec2fc33f8c49842bbe0787f81b/0_167_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14077ef3cab8d87897978aac090e6788","title":"pedallers pilgrimage britains best cycling routes","story":"Wild Cycling author Chris Sidwells shares nine of his favourite rides – from the rugged west Highlands of Scotland to the green and pleasant loops of the home counties  These rides are my choices based on a wide variety of cycling experiences. Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

As a child, she was intrigued by an elder woman with traditional Inuit tattoos – the only member of the community to have them. The memory never left her. Years later, she decided to research the sacred practice, which by then had become almost extinct.Johnston was a guest at the Adäka festival, the Whitehorse cultural event now in its eighth edition. Those very themes – oppression followed by resurgence and revival– were weaved through the programing, reminding visitors that no matter how impossible the fight against oppression can be, art remains a beacon of hope, a cornerstone of the resistance. Johnston has now tattooed dozens of Inuit women – including some in their 70s and beyond. The markings, often made using a stick and poke method, are highly personal and usually emblematic of defining life events, as well as family connections. They adorn women’s fingers, arms, thighs and – perhaps more strikingly – their faces. Adäka’s programming was bursting with similar stories of revitalisation. In the space of a week, more than 100 artists – visual artists, dancers, throat singers, musicians and fashion designers – took the stage, taught workshops and gave talks about topics as varied as herbalism, dog ownership in the Arctic or moose hide tanning at a “fish camp” set on the bank of the Yukon river. The festival welcomed everyone – from members of the Yukon’s 14 indigenous First Nations to locals and international visitors – and the joyous mood embodied this generosity of spirit: young children took part in special activities, tourists admired and purchased art in the galleryand artists mingled with the crowd, imparting their knowledge as they weaved, sculpted or carved in front of the crowd.Ashley Cummings, 20, from Pangnirtung, Nunavut, was tattooed by Johnston during the festival. Through tears, she explained that no one in her family could remember a member sporting the markings, so effective was the ban. To be able to finally reclaim the practice felt like “a huge relief” and an honor.The tide is finally turning – but it was a close call, and the blame can be squarely put at the feet of Canada’s residential school system. Starting in the 1840s until the last school closed in 1996, more than 150,000 indigenous children were separated from their family, and forced to assimilate. Gone was their right to see their family, to speak their ancestral language, to dance, to play the drums – to exist.The system’s aim was to “kill the Indian in the child”. Physical and sexual abuse was endemic, and ignoble “nutritional experiments” were conducted. More than 6,000 children have died at the hands of missionaries. In less than 100 years, a cultural genocide had effectively been committed. Dennis Shorty, 60, was also a guest artist at the festival. He was just five years old when a float plane landed in his remote community of Ross River and took him away to a residential school 400 kilometres away. Separated from his family and Kaska community, he found himself in a system which, he says, “stripped away his spirit and his dignity”. He was beaten if he tried to speak his ancestral language, and endured unspeakable abuse. In adulthood, to make sense of his trauma, Shorty found solace and meaning in his art, which was on display at Adäka. His work – intricate wood and antler carving, sculptures and paintings – has been purchased to sit in the Yukon’s permanent collection. He never forgot his Kaska language, and remains a fluent speaker. (He taught his German wife, Jennifer Froehling, who impressively speaks it, too.)The idea of transmission also occupies the mind of the Selkirk artist Carmen Baker. When she moved to Pelly Crossing (population 354), Baker was struck by the lack of music. There were no drumming, no singing. Her Northern Tutchone culture had been erased by the residential schools’ legacy. The world was quiet. In 2004, Baker started a drumming and dancing group with only six young girls enrolled. Today, she has more than 30 dancers (the youngest is nine months old and performed at Adäka in his mother’s arms). As she introduced dancers to the stage, she said she believed that “our identity is coming back to us. Our young people are catching on - this is part of who they are, it’s in their bloodline.” Sho Sho Esquiro, 38, grew up in Ross River, a community of only 350 people – “but thousands if you count the dogs”, she says, laughing. The Kaska Dene and Cree designer showcased her work at the festival’s eagerly anticipated fashion show. Her exquisite one-of-a-kind creations have been displayed in many galleries, including the Smithsonian.In 2014, when she was contacted to showcase eight pieces in Paris, Esquiro decided to be bold: her collection would be dedicated to the 4,000 murdered and missing indigenous women of Canada. At the time, the prime minister, Stephen Harper, had denied indigenous people an inquiry into the matter, and Esquiro saw it as her chance to bring both awareness and honor to the families affected. Her latest work, titled No Apology Necessary, is a reference to the Catholic church’s steadfast refusal to apologise for running two-thirds of residential schools. (The cornerstone of her collection is a jacket with the picture of the pope printed upside down another is a fur coat with the slogan “no apology necessary” printed on the back – the crowd cheered as the model walked down the runway wearing it). Esquiro’s father, grandparents, aunts and uncles were all survivors of the school system, and when it was recently announced than any acknowledgement would be denied to them, she says she saw firsthand how hurt her community was by this. She understood the reaction, but she says it also “made her angry – that we sit around waiting for an apology that may or may not come … We need to be accountable for our own healing.”Shorty, the antler and wood carving artist who survived residential school, agrees. He says he doesn’t care that the Catholic church never apologised. “I want to move forward, teach my craft, teach people how to move forward regardless of they apologise or not.”So what, then, helps to right this monumental wrong?Shorty doesn’t hesitate. “Hard work, being back on the land, using our language and sharing our culture with other cultures.” Adäka, then, is entirely part of the solution.An hour’s drive from Whitehorse, Harold Johnson, a member of the Crow Clan, welcomes you to his camp, where he recreated a traditional First Nations village with living structures, tools and hunting recreations. His interpretive walk will introduce you to trapping, hunting and shelter building techniques, and if you are lucky you will meet Nessi, his loyal dog who once fought a grizzly bear. Nestled between a lake and a mountain range, the center offers guided tours, demonstrations and story-telling, as well as a gallery showcasing Tlingit art.A biennial celebration of indigenous culture open to all – includes performances, demonstrations, tastings and a craft market."},{"url":null,"title":"late night roundup kimmel colbert republicans clowns","story":"Late-night comics discussed Peter Strzok’s 10-hour hearing before a House joint committee and this week’s Nato summitLate-night hosts on Thursday discussed FBI agent Peter Strzok’s testimony before Congress and the Nato summit in Brussels, where Donald Trump had contentious talks with allies.“What a day it was on Capitol Hill,” began Jimmy Kimmel. “FBI agent Peter Strzok had his turn in the hot seat. Peter Strzok, for those of you that haven’t been following the president’s tweets, is the guy Republicans are trying to use as proof of some sort of FBI conspiracy against Donald Trump.“Strzok,” the host explained, “was on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigations team, but then Mueller found out that Strzok, in 2016 during the election, had exchanged anti-Trump texts with his girlfriend Lisa Page, who was an FBI lawyer at the time, and he removed him from the investigation.” At Thursday’s nearly 10-hour meeting, which quickly turned into a partisan melee, Strzok was asked to read his texts with Page aloud. In two texts referring to Trump, he wrote: “OMG, he’s an idiot” and: “How was Trump other than a douche?”“So Strzok says these personal texts were his personal opinions,” said Kimmel. “But the bozos in the House, and they really are a collection of clowns, when you see them actually speak it is shocking. They desperately want to use this to discredit the whole investigation.”House Republicans, the host noted, believe Strzok was not only biased against Trump during his time with the FBI investigation but favorable toward Hillary Clinton in the bureau’s investigation of her use of a private email server.“In particular, this buckethead from Texas, Louie Gohmert, decided to focus on the fact that Strzok was married and having an affair with Lisa Page at the time,” said Kimmel, showing footage of Gohmert’s comments, which quickly sparked a shouting match on the House floor.Meanwhile, CBS’s Stephen Colbert discussed the Strzok hearing before covering Trump’s ongoing visit to Europe, where he is meeting with Nato allies, Theresa May and, next week in Helsinki, Vladimir Putin.“We were talking about the complete meltdown of institutional integrity in Washington,” Colbert said of the Strzok hearing. “You know who wasn’t there? Donald Trump. “Today, he was in England getting to have tea with the Queen,” Colbert said, launching into an impression of the president. “Your Majesty, I was watching The Crown on Netflix and I’ve got to say, you used to be smoking hot.”“But just this morning he was busy making Nato great again,” the host continued. “For instance, he was in Brussels at a meeting about Russian aggression in Ukraine and Georgia and – surprise surprise – Trump quickly changed the subject to military spending and warned allies that if they didn’t increase their payments, ‘I’ll do my own thing’.”Trump’s comments were taken as a threat to dismantle the Nato alliance, which led to an emergency meeting among world leaders, where one senior European official described Trump’s comments as “a stream of incoherent sentences”.“Trump walked away triumphant and immediately called an impromptu press conference where he boasted about what he’s accomplished,” said Colbert, showing footage of Trump claiming to have convinced allies to increase defense spending, saying: “We are doing numbers like they’ve never done before.”“He is taking a victory lap for stuff that was already going to happen,” the host concluded.

Algeria has experienced the hottest temperature ever reliably registered in Africa. Britain, meanwhile, has experienced its third longest heatwave, melting the roof of a science building in Glasgow and exposing ancient hill forts in Wales. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said the rising temperatures were at odds with a global cyclical climate phenomena known as La Niña, which is usually associated with cooling.“The first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year to date on record,” said Clare Nullis of the WMO.Taiwan is the most recent place to report a new high with a temperature of 40.3C in Tianxiang on Monday. This followed a flurry of other anomalies.Last week, a weather station at Ouargla in Algeria’s Sahara Desert, reported a maximum temperature of 51.3C on 5 July, the highest temperature reliably recorded in Africa. Even when the sun goes down, night is not providing the cooling relief it once did in many parts of the world. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world. Downtown Los Angeles also saw a new monthly July minimum overnight record of 26.1C on 7 July.Globally, the warmest year on record was in 2016, boosted by the natural climate cycle El Niño. Last year, temperatures hit the highest level without that amplifying phenomenon. This year, at the other cooling end of the cycle, is continuing the overall upward trend.Swathes of the northern hemisphere have seen unusually persistent warmth due to strong, persistent high pressure systems that have created a “heat dome” over much of Eurasia.“What’s unusual is the hemispheric scale of the heatwave,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “It’s not just the magnitude in any one location but that high temperatures are being seen over such a large area.”Northern Russia’s exceptionally sunny weather – seen on TV by billions thanks to the World Cup – has caused wildfires that affected 80,000 hectares of forest near the Krasnoyarsk region, which reported daily anomalies of 7C above average. The Western Siberian Hydromet Center has issued storm warnings after temperatures of more than 30C for five days. Climate watchers fear this will accelerate the melting of permafrost, releasing methane – a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.In California, daytime records were also set last week at Chino (48.9C), Burbank airport (45.6C) and Van Nuys airport (47.2C). In Canada, at least 54 deaths have been attributed to the prolonged heatwave and high humidity in Quebec. Montreal saw a new record high temperature of 36.6C on 2 July.In Europe, the WMO has warned of droughts, wildfires and harvest losses after the second hottest June on record. Over the past two weeks, records have been set in Tbilisi (40.5C), Shannon (32C), and Belfast (29.5C) Britain has cooled slightly in the past two days, after 17 days of temperatures over 28C. This was the third longest heatwave on record, following the record 19-day run in 2013 and the famous summer of 1976, when there were two prolonged spells of 18 days and 15 days. Dean Hall of the UK’s Met Office said Britain’s temperatures were forecast to rise again over the coming week.The concern is that weather fronts – hot and cold – are being blocked more frequently due to climate change. This causes droughts and storms to linger, amplifying the damage they cause. This was a factor in the recent devastating floods in Japan, where at least 150 people died after rainfall up to four times the normal level.Paolo Ruti of the WMO said it was difficult to ascribe any one weather event to climate change, but that recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts were in line with forecasts of how rising emissions will affect the climate.“Recent analysis suggests that anthropogenic forcing might indeed affect the characteristics of summer blocking events in the Euro-Asia sector, in particular leading to longer blocking episodes,” he said. Extreme weather events have buffeted much of the world over the past 12months, from the “Day Zero” drought in Cape Town to the abnormally powerful hurricanes Harvey and Irma that buffeted the east coast of the US and Caribbean.  Underscoring the link, a new report from scientists at the World Weather Attribution group indicates that manmade climate change and its effect on rainfall made the recent Cape Town drought three times more likely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ef60ea78ca8670c844bbada818cbd1d4a8e406/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75263c16896902a462d3e771081f0aff","title":"hiking african american racism nature","story":"Three African American hikers describe fears and stereotypes they have faced – and why they love hitting the trailsA few years ago, a white friend suggested we go on a hike. All the fears I had about being in nature hit me in the face. It’s a very real fear for black people, especially those from urban communities, that bad things happen to black people in the woods, like lynching. It’s something that you see again and again when you look at the history of the civil rights movement and slavery: black people going into the woods and not coming back.My friend had grown up hiking. I talked to her about my fears and she respected my apprehension. I said to myself: “You’ve got to do this now or it will never happen.”I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, so my mother kept us in a lot. Our house was across the street from a public park but it was rife with gang violence so we never went there.I always knew about hiking and camping from commercials and magazines. But the people doing it didn’t look like me. They were white, athletic and attractive. I’d never, ever seen anybody of color doing it, let alone a black male I associated the outdoors with whiteness. Nobody around me even thought about it. My mother grew up in the backwoods down south, but she never encouraged us to have a connection with nature.My friend and I headed to Starved Rock state park, two hours south of Chicago. We had to drive through this very wooded area and I remember thinking: “I hope nothing happens. I hope I don’t have to get out of the car.” When we started the hike, I had to let go of a lot of what I was feeling. An hour into it, we stopped to take in this view and I was amazed by everything I was experiencing. I loved not hearing the commotion of the city. No cars, no yelling, no arguments on the corner. Just the water, the birds and the wind. It was like a reset button. I remember thinking, “Why haven’t I been doing this all along? Everybody should be doing this. There’s nobody that shouldn’t be hiking!” It was overwhelming to realize that something I’ve always believed isn’t for me actually is. I had spent so much time being nervous about it when it was what I needed.I now go seven to eight times a month. Five days a week I work in sales, spending my time in ginormous condo buildings and busy infrastructure. As soon as I hop in the car to get out of town, the weight of the week lifts. I take my six-year-old daughter so that she knows earlier than I did that this is something beneficial. I let her lead the way on our path and allow her to make decisions for what she’s doing in nature. My mom’s proud of me but I’m still working on getting her out for a hike.Follow Aaron at @MidwestColorCampI grew up in a small town in North Carolina where most of the white people were farm owners and the black people were hired hands. My family farmed and as a child, I spent a lot of time topping tobacco and picking cucumbers, peppers and squash. We’d go out fishing and hang out on the rivers as a family but we were never encouraged to go far from the house. The feeling was that if you went out into the woods by yourself – and you’re black – if no one’s around, you might not end up coming back.The world has changed but that thought pattern is still there. Today, I’m the first African American chapter chair for the Sierra Club in the state of Virginia. It started because a friend took me to a local meeting and I walked in and there were all these old white people. I said, “OK, there has to be some other representation here.” Some people might have walked away but I think my background makes me a little different. Thirty-nine years ago I became a software developer when there were no black people, let alone women, in that industry, so I’ve always had to go a step above. Back then, all the guys smoked in the office and I didn’t, so I went home and practiced how to do it without coughing.But even now in my position as chair, I will still only go on hikes when I’m with a group of people I know. I live within walking distance of a nature trail and I would never go there by myself. It’s not the younger generation but the older generation that you see that look at you like you have no business there. Like you don’t belong. It’s like: “Get out. Get away.” Even though it’s public land, some people are like, “I’m white and therefore I have more rights and I’m better than you.” And some black people still think, “I’m black and if I’m out there, I’m supposed to be cleaning up or waiting on you.” Sometimes when I introduce myself to groups across the state, I have to take a deep breath because I’ll think: “Are these people going to respect me?”What I love about hiking and the outdoors is breathing that clean air and seeing the greenery around me and not hearing cars. Fresh air really energizes me. Part of that is probably because I was born and raised in the country. I don’t even want to think about my three-year-old great-grandson growing up in a world where he doesn’t know what a real river or real group of trees look like. I hate to think of him never ever seeing a live rabbit or squirrel or deer. I spend a lot of time talking to people about the future and keeping the planet livable.Within the Sierra Club, everyone is seriously nice, but understanding things from a different perspective is missing sometimes. I mean, why would a guy living in a $500,000 house know what it feels like to live in a place that you rent for $500 a month and the environmental issues that go with that? That people are just dumping trash in your neighborhood? A lot of older white people don’t know how to communicate with a black person of the street and the same the other way around. The older generation needs to be more embracing and think about how other people feel.My first trip to a national park was life-changing. It was four years ago and I went with some friends to Yosemite. I was getting over a breakup at the time. While there, I met Shelton Johnson, a black park ranger and writer. We got into a discussion about how there aren’t a lot of African American families visiting national parks. It made me sad because as a kid I would have loved to have seen Yosemite. That first trip, I pushed myself and my friends to do a strenuous hike I wasn’t expecting us to complete it but we did and when we got to the top, standing above a waterfall, just looking out on the valley, it made the whole breakup seem so small in comparison to everything that’s out there to explore.After Trump became president, I became a little nervous about traveling in the US. Racism became more overt. Just after the inauguration I went with a couple of friends to western Arizona. On the way, we passed lots of gun stores, some with Confederate flags, and I felt very uncomfortable. When we got there I mostly felt OK because I was with friends who blended in, but there was this one old man who stared at me from the other side of the street. He was eating an ice cream and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. I felt challenged and stared back until he looked away.My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. This January, to celebrate our anniversary, we went on our first official road trip as a couple. He’s white and I’m black, and when we’re hiking in the LA area, I don’t even think about that. But this trip we were heading to Death Valley national park, in a relatively conservative area.On the trails we received nothing but stares. People just wouldn’t stop. They weren’t mean or evil but at some point I said to my boyfriend: “I don’t want to hold your hand any more.” I felt bad because he was being affectionate and wanted to hug and kiss my cheek but I was like: “No, not here.” I didn’t want to make anyone else uncomfortable, even though I was.I feel like it’s important for black girls to hike. When I was young I would have loved to have had someone encouraging me to get outside. To not be afraid. I’ve decided to apply for a master’s degree in parks and recreation management, and a friend and I set up a hiking group for women of color in LA called Black Girls Trekkin’. I want to be a model to other young girls.If you have an outdoors experience you’d like to share with the , please write to us at publiclands@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93ef332f84c490c81244bbf67945548ade5185c5/0_160_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fd77a478dcde36901dee46699e4096","title":"wework meat events expense ban","story":"The workspace company gave environmental reasons for banning meat from all budgets, including their upcoming festivalWeWork, the real estate company that rents out and manages office space, has announced that they will no longer hold any staff events that include meat, and that staff will not be able to expense any meals that include poultry, pork or red meat. In an email to staff, WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey also said that WeWork’s upcoming Summer Camp event, a music and food festival which is only open to WeWork members, will not serve any meat options. Tickets to the event cost as much as $409 (£309) – a high price based, in part, on the free food available once on site.McKelvey said the company was eliminating meat for environmental reasons. “New research indicates that avoiding meat is one of the biggest things an inidual can do to reduce their personal environmental impact, even more than switching to a hybrid car.”The company estimates that the policy will save 445.1m pounds of CO2 emissions and 15,507,103 animals by 2023. US is based at one of the many offices run by WeWork in New York City. Currently on the event schedule is a TGIM with Capital One event that promises “mini doughnuts and bacon, bacon, bacon”. This is one of many events promising to serve meat at WeWorks across the world – even as the policy was being announced, at the Corrigan Station WeWork in Kansas City lunch is being provided from Monk’s Roast Beef as part of “food truck Friday”, for example.When the  spoke to WeWork about whether these events would be cancelled, a spokesperson said they would not, and clarified: “This policy only applies to events paid for by WeWork. Members and employees are welcome to bring in meat for meals, and members are welcome to serve meat at events they host … we are working with vendors to align our commitment for previously scheduled events, and meat will not be served at events hosted by WeWork moving forward.”This is likely to create headaches for the company, as many of its events are held in partnership or as promotion for other brands – the lines of what counts as the WeWork budget is likely to be blurry. WeWork is valued at about $20bn, although some analysts believe it is worth even more. Only Uber, Airbnb and SpaceX have higher valuations among US startups. The company’s business model involves buying up offices in cities across the world and then renting the spaces back out to businesses and iniduals. But unlike other real estate companies, it also provides office services to its tenants – such as free coffee, yoga classes and regular networking events as well as more basic concerns like toilets and security."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7622ff0a5feec47e48351050c6b71c892c048414/0_177_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b58bc8d9d0b5ded9a8339ecc39f61a7c","title":"england belgium third place gareth southgate st petersburg","story":"The disappointment of the semi-final defeat has yet to subside but Gareth Southgate and his players are desperate to end their campaign on a high in St Petersburg on SaturdayThree days on the sense of regret is just as raw. Gareth Southgate has done all he can to re-energise his England squad for the third-place play-off, such a cruel commitment in the context of what might have been, but he still found himself squinting at his laptop in the small hours of Friday morning, poring over yet another re‑run of the defeat by Croatia, wincing through that period in the second half when, for the first time in Russia, his side appeared to panic and their style slipped. Cursing Ivan Perisic’s “bizarre” back-header and the spasm of indecision which gripped his team’s backline to shatter a dream.The manager has attempted to retain a modicum of perspective. His painful memories of Euro 96 have never really dimmed, though that semi‑final defeat by Germany 22 years ago was endured by a team he acknowledges now were far closer to the finished article. Many of their number knew their chance came and went that night, whereas the buzzwords accompanying the current crop revolve around youthful energy, long-term vision and this being the start of something special. “But we were still 20 minutes from a World Cup final, and then, in extra time, 10 minutes from a shootout to get to a World Cup final,” he said. “That is going to live with me forever, no doubt about that.“I’m old enough to know I don’t have to beat myself up unnecessarily. When I was a player I had a very simplistic mind-set: win I was good, lose and I was an idiot, nothing in between. I bizarrely felt the need to punish myself for that. I’m a lot more rational now. I can see what we have achieved, though when you are so close you look back at what we might have done. I’m conscious I’ve had to try to raise everybody. But, that all said, I’m still up watching the game again at four o’clock this morning.”It will have pained him just as much on the third, fourth or fifth viewing. The past few days have demanded a different kind of management. Southgate’s body clock was always likely to have been scrambled at this point, whether by the white nights of Repino – there is a hint of darkness now with midsummer passed – or that flurry of post-match flights shuttling the squad back to the Gulf of Finland. They touched down at 6.30am after the agony at the Luzhniki Stadium. But there is one more fixture to play, one last chance to showcase progress, and there has been precious little time in which to prepare.The manager had called a meeting of staff and players in the gym at the ForRestMix Club on Thursday afternoon with all 58 of the travelling party in the room and the captain, and prospective Golden Boot winner, Harry Kane perched on one of the barbells. The message had been about ending on a high, beating Belgium at St Petersburg Stadium on Saturday to secure the second-best finish in the nation’s history and claim a bronze medal as tangible reward of sorts for exceeding expectations.All 23 players trained day to suggest a focus remains, even if the selection will be much altered. Ashley Young and Jesse Lingard have been ill. Kieran Trippier and Jordan Henderson are carrying injuries. Kane, desperate to start, looked jaded in Moscow. Those who replace them will be fresher, eager to make their own mark. Yet the sense of anticlimax will be no less numbing for them.Southgate pointed to the group game defeat by the same opposition as motivation, though that duel in Kaliningrad had been competed in by reserve teams. Belgium seem more intent on selecting a stronger lineup this time. Their golden generation will depart Russia saddled by a different kind of disappointment: they were contenders. Yet, regardless of day’s result, the England manager will encourage his squad and staff post-match to let their hair down on their last night back in Repino with the next stage of this team’s evolution sure to mean that, by the time the Uefa Nations League kicks off against Spain in September, there will have been changes to personnel.“That group of people will never be together again,” he said. “That’s why you’ve got to enjoy those moments. You have to balance everything with: where do I think this team is, realistically? We’ve got a huge amount out of this group of players, and they deserve massive credit. If I look at Pickford, Maguire, Trippier … they had a handful of caps each coming into the tournament, and they have all performed unbelievably well. As have so many others who don’t have huge experience.“But the reality is players, staff ... things always change, for whatever reason. We never close our mind to people, and there are some younger players we’re excited about and who could get Premier League football this year and start to push. But they’ve got it all to do now. It should be harder to get into the group than it has been this time.”He will have to wait to switch off. Southgate and his players fly back to Birmingham on Sunday with the new Premier League campaign less than a month away and with a meeting pencilled in back at St George’s Park next week to plan for the September internationals. He also has letters to write to all those involved in Russia, a self-imposed task – “It’s quite nice to receive a letter in this day and age, and there’s something special about that” – thanking them for their efforts. The well-deserved holiday will have to wait a while longer and, even then, he admitted his thoughts will rarely deviate from football.“The players are going to experience a tournament as close to what we experienced in 1996 and 1966. That’s incredible for everybody. We saw what the Olympics were like in 2012. And, again, we’ll have the players inspired by what’s happened over the last few weeks. They can see the possible impact. We did talk to them about that before but it was hard for them to really get it. Most of them weren’t born in 1990 and they were too young for Euro 96. So they haven’t really felt what the nation really getting excited about the team feels like. They’ve seen that now. As have all the kids who are playing in junior teams. They can see if that’s what it’ll be like for the seniors that’s really exciting. But that’s for the future. We have to finish well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7951287b268c4c1151ca35338e2ced0099f69cd4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b136e3545bb6ec5518a56b28c4dec682","title":"england future sessegnon sancho foden gareth southgate","story":"Ryan Sessegnon, Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden are among those who hope to force a way into Gareth Southgate’s plansThe right-back, 19, progressed through the national age groups to be selected for Gareth Southgate’s World Cup squad on the back of an eye-catching campaign for his club. He was excellent while earning a second cap in the group game defeat by Belgium. He is quick, strong and with huge potential taking set plays and the only barrier between the Champions League finalist and the England first team has been the excellence of Kieran Trippier, but Alexander-Arnold represents the long-term future. Like Ruben Loftus-Cheek he will have gained from his experiences in Russia and has done nothing but impress, on and off the pitch, at the World Cup. A third cap surely awaits in Saturday’s third-place play-off.The Liverpool striker, secured from Chelsea in 2014 and prolific at junior international levels, scored eight goals to win the Golden Boot at the Under-17s World Cup last year and might have made an impact in the first team last season but for a knee injury from January. He has since apparently agreed a new five-year deal at Anfield – an announcement is to come – with the club having grown infuriated by interest from Borussia Mönchengladbach to the extent that they cancelled a scheduled pre-season friendly against the Bundesliga club.Another singled out by Southgate, Foden claimed the World Cup Golden Ball award after England’s Under-17s triumphed at the tournament in 2017. The midfielder has been with Manchester City since the age of eight, with Pep Guardiola so impressed that he promoted him into the first-team set-up in December 2016. His debut came 11 months later – he is the fourth-youngest Englishman to play in the Champions League at 17 years 177 days – and he made five Premier League appearances last season to claim a title winner’s medal. “Anyone who can get into Manchester City’s team – that’s a hell of a team – is doing well,” Aidy Boothroyd, the England Under-21 coach, said. The 18-year-old may also spend next season on loan.Mawson, at 24, is older than the rest and is expected to feature heavily in England’s future, not least with central defensive options relatively threadbare (for all that Trevoh Chalobah, on loan at Ipswich from Chelsea, caught the eye). The Swansea defender, like many of Southgate’s squad, forged a reputation in the lower leagues. He was called up for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March but did not win a cap. That was a source of considerable disappointment and Southgate telephoned the player to suggest the World Cup might be one tournament too soon. Should he remain a top-flight defender next season, he will be very much in the national manager’s plans.Mount has been name-checked regularly by Southgate, trained with the seniors before their departure for Repino and, with Ryan Sessegnon and Phil Foden, attended England’s game against Tunisia in Volgograd as a guest of Nike to experience life at the tournament. The attacking midfielder spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, where he scored 14 goals and provided 10 assists in 39 appearances to be named their player of the season. To that can be added his Golden Player award at the 2017 Under-19s European Championship, where he supplied Lukas Nmecha with England’s winner in the final. The 19-year-old is expected to sign a new long-term contract at Stamford Bridge before continuing his development on loan, potentially under Frank Lampard and Jody Morris at Derby County.Another under-17 World Cup winner in India last year, Sancho took the brave decision to turn his back on Manchester City and Guardiola last summer and, aged 17, moved to Dortmund in search of first-team football. It is a mark of his talent that Real Madrid and Barcelona were as disappointed as City that the Bundesliga lured the forward away. He took the No 7 shirt vacated by Ousmane Dembélé, now a World Cup finalist, and made 12 league appearances, scoring his first senior goal in a 4-0 rout of Bayer Leverkusen in April. Formerly on the books at Watford, Sancho is one of a number of talented English youngsters – Mandela Egbo, Ademola Lookman, Keanan Bennetts, Jonathan Panzo, Noni Madueke are among others – who have pursued their development abroad.The 18-year-old, transformed from left-back to forward, excelled with 16 goals to help propel Slavisa Jokanovic’s team out of the Championship and is preparing for a first Premier League campaign. He has been pencilled in as key to England’s future. Boothroyd has described Sessegnon as “an exceptional talent” who will thrive for club and country, a player whose skill, pace and single-mindedness mark him out. “He is so focused in what he wants to do,” said Boothroyd, who handed Sessegnon a first Under-21s cap in March. “Nothing is going to get in his way. He’s a marked man now and the best players come through that. He will because he’s an outstanding talent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b395948a279f6def04521cc5af7d370fd59f381f/24_155_4338_2603/master/4338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2211a5531dbb4781b88e7a1f10aff1e","title":"gary lineker england ","story":"The BBC presenter and member of the Italia 90 squad says England are on the verge of being ‘exceptionally competitive’Gary Lineker says he felt like a German on Wednesday evening inside Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium as he willed England to reach penalties, so confident was he in their ability to cope with the pressure of a shootout.As part of the Italia 90 team which suffered the agony of a penalty shootout defeat when England had last reached a World Cup semi-final 28 years ago, it was an unsettling sensation for Lineker to be hankering for spot-kicks again. Against Colombia in the last 16, they won a penalty shootout for the first time at a World Cup with only Jordan\u0026nbspHenderson having his effort saved and Jordan Pickford making a vital save.As the clock ticked away at 1-1 against Croatia in the semi-final Lineker hoped they were heading for penalties again. “I listened to years of nonsense from really bright footballing people that telling me: ‘It’s different when you’re out there, it feels different than in practice.’” Lineker said. “Well of course it does but by God it helps if you’ve hit 50 a day, hitting targets and under pressure. I used to practice all the time as a designated penalty taker but some of the others never did anything.“With 15 minutes to go against Croatia even of normal time I was thinking I’d take a penalty shootout now because I fancied us strongly,” he adds. “They’re so well drilled, you could see it against Colombia whereas I watched Croatia penalties in two games and they weren’t that good. It’s a really weird feeling as an England fan thinking ‘I hope it goes to penalties’ but kind of nice. I suddenly felt quite Germanic.”Lineker believes the way this England squad has been primed for penalty shootouts is indicative of the fastidious preparation which led to such a successful tournament, even with a team young in age and lacking international experience.“Some credit has to go the FA in terms of appointing Gareth Southgate eventually and the amount of planning that has gone on from him,” Lineker says. “He obviously had the backing of the FA to do that. Youth development now in England is as good as anywhere in the world which has taken most of my lifetime to get to but is very positive. We’ve been successful in the age group tournaments and teams that do well at youth level generally do well at World Cups. If they keep investing in grassroots, and the money that they might get if Wembley is sold actually goes into grassroots – and I know there is a commitment to that – I think the future is very bright.”When the Italia 90 team returned after their defeat to West Germany, the closest England had come to a World Cup final since 1966, Lineker was taken aback by how much their run in the tournament had united the country. He recognises a similar mood this summer as Southgate’s team unexpectedly reached the same stage.“You’re cocooned in a bubble in tournaments although with social media now the players will have a better grasp of what happening back home than in my day,” he says. “I flew back from Russia to England for a couple of days last week as there was a break in the schedule and even I was being stopped in the street, with people telling me how amazing it was and everyone talking about it.“They’ll be surprised by the adulation at home,” he said. “That makes you feel a bit better but then every so often you’ll think: ‘God, we were so close to having a pop at footballing immortality.’ Some players will never get another chance but a lot of them will, England are just on the cusp of being exceptionally competitive.“I very much doubt the draw will fall as favourably as that again but the good news is next time round we’ll have better players. We have young players like Ryan Sessegnon and Phil Foden and the players from this World Cup will be more experienced and actually still in their prime, possibly for the next two World Cups.”In the absence of England in the World Cup final, Lineker hopes France’s teenage striker Kylian Mbappé can light up the biggest stage, as he has done so far. “He’s been the young player of the tournament,” Lineker says. “There’s no question this kid is going to be the next big one, he’s fabulous and reminds me a little bit of the Brazilian Ronaldo. To be doing what he did in the semi-final at 19, the performance of the tournament so far.“I think football is about seeing not only great teams but superstars. In this World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo had a great game against Spain but it didn’t happen for Portugal and Lionel Messi is in a very poor Argentina side at the moment with all sorts of problems. Neymar’s reputation will have been damaged by some of his antics even though he is still a delightful footballer. But we may just be witnessing the emergence of the next great one.”The BBC is covering the World Cup final between France and Croatia across TV, radio and online from 4pm on Sunday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6756cab7f1ecc93a89e14e93c51d4c946b6955a8/0_44_3977_2387/master/3977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b63ea0f6f13d21ad7b794950397dfe60","title":"kylian mbappe fast learner world cup final france croatia","story":"He made his debut for Monaco aged 16, became the world’s most expensive teenager at 18 and will play a World Cup final on Sunday at 19. Can anything stop the rise of Kylian Mbappé?The life of the little football geniuses sometimes has all kinds of discord and anger. Kylian Mbappé has been through this and is bound to be held responsible for the conflicts in his early career. But this kid, deeply devoted to the game, seemed stronger than anything, on the field and off it, as he prepared from a young age to navigate the pitiless environment of football.“His father Wilfried has videos of him as a child, in which he tells his story,” says family friend Alain Mboma. “He is four years old – four years old! – and he described the journey he wanted to take.”“I was a dreamer when I was younger,” Mbappé confided to us a few weeks ago. “My parents did care a bit about ‘my mouth’. But now they are the ones in the wrong position.”He had to fight to get there, guided by his own impatience, which in this case may have had some virtues. In 2015-2016, his third season in Monaco, Mbappé entered his last year as a youth team player and did not understand why Leonardo Jardim did not include him in the professional group. He had the ability, he knew it. But Jardim did not know, until the international week of November\u0026nbsp2015.“I remember very well the first training session Kylian had with Jardim,” says Luis Campos, Monaco’s former technical director who used to work as José Mourinho’s scout. “At the end of the session, Leonardo calls me and says: ‘This kid, he must not go down to the youth team anymore, he will work with us and when he gets his chance, I think he’ll get there.’ Leonardo was a little late, that’s the truth.”The period is crucial, for the player and for the club, who feared losing its prized asset for free at the end of that season. Behind the scenes, moves were going on. Paris\u0026nbspSaint-Germain, Liverpool and Arsenal had already made multiple approaches. Arsène Wenger met him in person to try to convince him to join the London club. Mbappé falters, he is especially on the brink of answering PSG’s call. But, in Paris to sign the contract, he is finally convinced that Laurent Blanc, the PSG coach at the time, will not give him a chance. “We were not very far away. There were two clubs in the final – AS Monaco and PSG,” said Olivier Létang, then deputy sports director of the latter. “What was missing was the feeling he would get playing time. Because Kylian wanted to play and it was his feeling that he would have more opportunity to play at Monaco than PSG.”It was finally Campos, tasked by the Monaco’s owners to resolve the situation, who tipped the decision in their favour.On March 6 2016, it’s official: Mbappé signed his first professional contract and committed to Monaco until 2019, with a signing-on bonus of about €3m and an evolutionary monthly salary: €85,000 the first year, €100,000 the second and €120,000 the third. Considerable sums for a player of his age.Not everyone is so impressed, however. The coach of France’s under-17 team, Jean-Claude Giuntini, who did not respond to our requests for an interview, considered Mbappé to be an inconsistent talent. In 2015, he did not even summon the striker to compete in the European Championship in Bulgaria that was won by the Les Bleuets. He preferred Odsonne Édouard (now at Celtic), who was crowned top scorer of the competition. The following season, in the under‑18s, Giuntini still did not select the Monaco player. He did not believe in him and criticised Mbappé for a lack of defensive involvement and his attitude. Suddenly, Ludovic Batelli, the under‑19 coach, decided to gazump him.“At the time, I was an orphan of Ousmane Dembélé, who rose very quickly to the under-21 side,” says Batelli. “There was a missing link and I thought of Kylian. I inquired about him. I was told little things about his character, about his attitude. I was told that he had an inidualistic relationship on the pitch, sometimes showing small moods. I ignored all that. I just focused on what I saw when he came with us. And there, I saw a future prodigy, which, in addition, adhered to all our codes.”This was despite a considerable age gap. “In fact, he was two years younger,” says Batelli. “And when we see, at that age, the importance of the differences from a size, weight, maturity, intelligence point of view … it was fantastic. He had an ability to express and analyse that I have rarely seen in kids of this age.”His new teammates adopted him immediately. “When he arrived in the group, we had to play the elite qualifying round for the European Championship,” said Lucas Tousart, the Lyon midfielder. “We go to Serbia and we have three games to play. We must finish first and it is him who scored the goal that allowed us to win the last game and go to the finals.”A few weeks later, in the summer of 2016, Mbappé, still only 17, and his team are crowned European Under-19 champions. He scored five goals in five games during the competition, including two in the semi-final.This is an extract from France Football’s article that was published in September 2017"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ec00965f13d416b3a5c2562d982e9c87b05e8e/0_160_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72f39d10eefac7754a67d795b068c2d5","title":"maurizio sarri jorginho chelsea manager antonio conte sacked","story":"• Sarri to replace sacked Antonio Conte as manager• Midfielder Jorginho chooses Chelsea ahead of Manchester CityMaurizio Sarri and Jorginho were at Stamford Bridge on Friday evening to complete their moves to Chelsea.Sarri is taking over as manager from Antonio Conte, who left his job on Thursday.

France have powered their way to the World Cup final, where they will start as favourites against Croatia in Moscow, and it is to their credit that it will be a fifth major final in 20 years. Yet the journey to the point where a nation can dream was ignited by the nightmare of the last of them.The countdown to Croatia has been illuminated by French confessions and they have zeroed in on the final of Euro 2016. It was meant to be France’s tournament and not only because they were the host and after they beat Germany in the semi-final they thought the job was done. Portugal would be a pushover in the final. As everybody knows, it did not turn out that way. Portugal won 1-0.Olivier Giroud talked of how Didier Deschamps’ team had been “a bit euphoric” after the Germany game while Samuel Umtiti also indicated where it went wrong. “We know what we didn’t do well at the Euros and what we shouldn’t do again,” he said. “The coach has talked to us and warned us not to be overconfident.”It was left to Paul Pogba to spell it out. “At the Euros we thought we\u0026nbsphad already won it before the final,” the midfielder said. “When we beat Germany, we thought it was\u0026nbspthe final. We thought we’d won the final before playing it, which was\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspmistake.”By any reckoning the admissions have been remarkable and they have shone a light on the psyche of Deschamps’ players. On one level the sky-high self-assurance might not be all bad, showing – as it did – the complete absence of doubt. These are high-level performers, who have a clear sense of their worth.A related question concerned the timing of the comments. Would the players have been so open before, say, their first game at this World Cup, in which they scraped past Australia? They have felt empowered by the fact they have reached another final and they can now say why it will be different this time. Perversely it shows them in a more focused light.“It’s true that after the Germany semi-final we were too happy,” Matuidi said. “We still think about it and we have to use this experience for Sunday. We will prepare differently. It was a good lesson.”The transition from the low of Portugal to the high they now feel has been pronounced and, for much of the time, fraught. Deschamps has been stalked by criticism of his team’s playing style – where was the identity? - while he oversaw bold calls in qualification and when he named his 23-man squad for Russia.Out went 14 of his players from the Euros and in came a crop of youngsters, many of whom were untested. Deschamps was not influenced by previous loyalties or by where some of his players were playing – witness the exclusion of Manchester United’s Anthony Martial and Arsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette. It was Deschamps striking out on his own, selecting a group that would, primarily, work for him and each other.Before the finals France were not among the favourites and, after three uninspiring group games, in which Deschamps described his team’s efforts as “laborious”, the knives were out. Had they lost to Argentina in the last 16, a section of the French media would have called for Deschamps to go.Argentina was where it all changed. Deschamps had arrived at a system for the second group tie against Peru, when France won 1-0, in which Pogba was asked to curb his natural flamboyance alongside N’Golo Kanté in central midfield, Matuidi worked off the left and Antoine Griezmann and Giroud did likewise in central attacking areas. The free role was granted to the 19-year-old prodigy, Kylian Mbappé, on the right.Deschamps stuck with it against Argentina and, with Mbappé running riot on the counterattack, France won 4-3. They have not looked back, with Deschamps’ tactics looking similarly balanced against Uruguay in the quarter-final and Belgium in the semi-final.Belgium did not like it, with the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois of Chelsea, accusing Deschamps of “anti-football”. The style is certainly reactive and, in the Belgium game, it led to Griezmann and Giroud dropping deep to harass the deep-lying midfielders, Axel Witsel and Mousa Dembélé. Yet the fact is that France have been in control of each of their knockout ties.“Does Courtois think that he plays Barcelona football at Chelsea?” Griezmann chided. “I don’t care how – I just want a second star to be on our shirt.” Umtiti added: “We don’t have anything to answer. What’s important for us is to be qualified and now to win the final. When you win, you don’t talk about second or third.”Mbappé has thrilled at his breakout tournament, particularly against Argentina and Belgium, and the praise has been fulsome. Pogba described him as “one of the most talented players France has ever had”. But the reason for the team’s progress has been the miserly defensive unit – and that extends to Pogba and Kanté in front of the back four and Matuidi in his narrow role on the left. France have never lost a game in which Pogba and Kanté have started.Hugo Lloris has been arguably the goalkeeper of the tournament, making decisive early saves in most of the matches, yet the linchpin has been the centre-half, Raphaël Varane. At the 2014 World Cup – the first competition of Deschamps’ time in charge – it was Varane who was beaten too easily by Mats Hummels for Germany’s winning goal in the quarter-final. That sort of weakness now seems unthinkable in the Real Madrid player.“Varane is a boss,” Pogba said. “He couldn’t have done it in 2014 but now he can. He is only 25 but it feels as though he has been playing at the top level for 20 years.”Deschamps was once derided for being a water carrier – a reference to his sideways playing style – but now he stands to walk on it. The captain of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup, he hopes to become only the third man to win it as a manager, too, following Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and West Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer.Deschamps can be a little snarky, as a Russian journalist found out before the semi-final against Belgium. A theme of the tournament has been the desire of seemingly every local to elicit compliments. What do you think of Russia? What do you think of city X or city Y? In this case Deschamps was asked what he thought of Stanislav Cherchesov’s Russia team. The timing was horrible.“What?” Deschamps replied, brimming with indignation. “Have you just asked me about the Russian national team? Why? I think we should move on.”But Deschamps’ man-management of his squad has been superb and the message from the players is that he has relaxed a little since the Argentina game. “He’s changed after that,” Griezmann said. “The pressure went a bit lower.” The explosiveness of Mbappé and the platform that Deschamps has created for him also gives the manager a degree of insulation against those who would attack him for his pragmatism.“Deschamps has something special – something very few people have,” Pogba said. “He was a great player, a World Cup winner, a captain and he knows how to talk to players, including those who are a bit more timid. We are more mature than we were two years ago and our relationship with Deschamps is changing. He talks to us differently now. He knows what he can tell us and he knows we will understand.”Matuidi mentioned his surprise at how quickly the young players have settled – not only Mbappé but the 22-year-old full-backs, Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernández – and Deschamps has to take a portion of the credit for that. The blend of youthful abandon and greater know-how from the senior players has driven France. “Seventy per cent of the job is mental strength,” Giroud said. “Talent alone is not sufficient.”If Euro 2016 has cast its shadows, then the talk has also taken in more positive omens. In 1998 France beat Croatia in the semi-final while they could enjoy the emergence of a jet-heeled forward called Thierry Henry and the selfless work of a non-scoring striker in Stéphane Guivarc’h. For them, read Mbappé and Giroud. Remember how Laurent Blanc would kiss the pate of Fabien Barthez before matches? Now Griezmann touches the moustache of the substitute, Adil Rami.France are fixed on emulating the achievement of that great team and, in the process, chasing away their more recent demons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fec241592a0f48c70454d31313dacc2b9bc1a1a/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b7bfe965881241584a5091be5195d72","title":"the roads to moscow a world cup photo essay","story":"Russian photographer Evgeny Feldman has spent the last five weeks documenting his homeland as people have visited from all over the globe for the World Cup. As well as photographing the daily life of towns and cities during the tournament, he was also at the stadiums to capture the key moments and stars of the World Cup such as Kylian Mbappé, Luka Modric and Harry Kaneby Evgeny Feldman,  Jim Powell and words by  Shaun WalkerIt seems a long, long time ago when Yuri Gazinskiy jumped to head home the first of five Russia goals against Saudi Arabia, in the World Cup’s opening match. The excitement and sense of possibility of the early stages transitioned to the nail-biting drama of the early knockout rounds, as the tournament tapered inevitably towards its final conclusion.The biggest winners of this World Cup, aside from either France or Croatia when they lift the trophy at the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday evening, are the hosts.The most widely heard chant at almost every game was that of the neutral locals, unimaginative yet emphatic: “Ros-si-ya”. The flag-waving and chanting was of a different order to that of recent years in Russia: it was joyous, unifying patriotism rather than the angry, reactionary jingoism of 2014 around the annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin was a largely absent figure, restricting himself to an appearance at the opening match and a short meeting in the Kremlin with footballers.In the end, these have not been the Putin games, they have been the Russia games, showcasing a nation that has changed tremendously in the past two decades, and giving it a chance to put on a smiling and hospitable face that few outside its borders knew existed. The country took delight in its moment of glory, winning over the hearts of many travelling fans who had not expected the warmth of the welcome, the long nights of dancing and drinking, and the pleasant and historically fascinating host cities.All roads led to Moscow, with almost all air, rail and road travel between the cities easiest through the capital. This meant Moscow became a fan hub, packed not only with fans awaiting games in the city but those stopping over for a day or two between the football. It was the World Cup of Google Translate and of Tinder, with thousands of friendships and relationships springing up between locals and fans.On the pitch, it has also been a World Cup to remember. The lack of a clear favourite made for a gloriously unpredictable tournament. Only Egypt and Panama lost all three of their group games, there were very few matches that were so one-sided as to lack all intrigue, and just a sole 0-0. The shock of the group stage was the German exit, particularly surprising after their at-the-death winner against Sweden appeared to have given them a predictably German escape route from the group.Many nations had more positive stories, such as a Belgium team that dispatched Brazil in perhaps the match of the tournament, before falling to France. England, for the first time since 1990, made a semi-final, and briefly united the nation in the belief that it was “coming home”. It wasn’t, of course, but at least the realisation when it came felt less soul-destroying than at previous tournaments. Croatia’s appearance in the final is a truly extraordinary vindication of a “golden generation” that looked like it might never come good.And then, again, there were the hosts, whose limited but spirited team made an inspirational run to the quarter-finals, seeing off Spain on penalties before falling in the same way to Croatia. “We achieved victory in the moral sense: the country was united, everyone was happy and full of joy,” said Stanislav Cherchesov, Russia’s coach.During the group stage, Moscow’s Nikolskaya Street fizzed with cosmopolitan energy, as fans from around the world gathered with locals in song, dance and drinking. And then, the fans started thinning out, especially as the well-supported South American teams headed for the exit. Peru, with the most glorious fans of all, were out after just two games, left to wonder what might have been had Christian Cueva scored rather than skied his penalty when they were 0-0 with Denmark in their opening game. Colombia’s massed ranks of yellow also left Russia after their team fell to that most unusual of things, an English penalty shootout win, while the vast hordes of Argentinians were left devastated by their 4-3 loss to France, powered by 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe, one of the tournament’s most impressive performers.Some of other big names offered flashes of intrigue before fading away in the knockout stages: Cristiano Ronaldo’s stunning hat-trick in Portugal’s opening game against Spain and Lionel Messi’s impressive strike against France, but neither of their sides made it to the quarter finals. Neymar played with skill and grace, save the ridiculous play-acting, but could not prevent Brazil from losing to Belgium. On Monday morning, the World Cup circus will leave town, with 64 matches played, billions of dollars of revenue accrued, and millions of cans of Fifa-approved Budweiser drunk around the stadiums. With the next World Cup in Qatar, Russia 2018 is likely to be remembered fondly for some time, providing a different picture of the country to many foreigners, and possibly changing the attitudes of many Russians to the outside world, as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6620d9f2d53957bda3bd548dbb7977e9caee3d/0_89_2344_1406/master/2344.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ea6d3488e46601bc09dd5cca38ca635","title":"tiredness croatia ivan rakitic world cup","story":"• Rakitic says every Croatian will watch ‘historic’ France game• ‘That amount of joy, togetherness, unity, pride, it’s incredible’Ivan Rakitic has said Croatia is united as never before ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday and brushed off a series of distractions around the squad, saying they have had no impact on preparations for the biggest match in the country’s history.“This is a historic game not just for the 13 or 14 players and the squad but also for everybody who is a Croat,” Rakitic said. “There will be 4.5 million players on the pitch.“I think that you only need to take a look at the footage coming from Croatia to see what’s been going on over the past month. It cannot be described with words, that amount of joy, togetherness, unity, pride, it’s incredible … If there was a stadium big enough for 4.5 million people it would be full.”Croatia, who got past Denmark and Russia on penalties and needed extra time to beat England, have played more minutes than any other team at the tournament.The World Cup final will be the 71st game of the season for the indefatigable Rakitic, who has played 55 times for Barcelona and 15 for Croatia. The night before the semi-final with England he was fighting a fever but recovered in time to play.Rakitic brushed off concerns about tiredness and said the importance of the game would spur the squad on: “There will be excess power and excess energy, no worries about that,” he said.“We will carry one another, we will get the energy, we know that this is the biggest game of our lives, and we want to leave the pitch with our heads held high and to be able to say we’ve done everything. We just need a little bit of luck to get the desired result,” Rakitic added.He thought the Croatia team had “reached hearts around the world” with their run to the final, and predicted that, in addition to 4.5m Croatians, there would be “hundreds of millions of people rooting for us on Sunday” against France.Preparations for the tournament were overshadowed by a court case against Zdravko Mamic, one of the most influential figures in Croatian football, in which Luka Modric has been charged with perjury and the defender Dejan Lovren is also being investigated.Many Croatia fans were extremely ambivalent in their attitudes to Modric but, with the midfield playmaker now a serious contender for the Golden\u0026nbspBall,\u0026nbspsuccess on the pitch has helped heal isions in the country over the team.A further problem erupted during the tournament when a video was released of the defender Domagoj Vida shouting “Glory to Ukraine” after Croatia had beaten Russia.The squad apologised and sent home the former international Ognjen Vukojevic who, like Vida, played for Dynamo Kyiv and featured in the video saying: “This victory is for Dynamo and for Ukraine.”The Russian crowd at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium relentlessly booed Vida whenever he touched the ball in the semi-final against England. Rakitic grew prickly when asked about the incidents.“There is not much to discuss,” he said. “I understand that your job is to find something to write about, you have to embellish things a little bit. We respect you obviously, we know that you have a job to do and our opinions might differ but that doesn’t really\u0026nbspmatter.“There really wasn’t any kind of a scandal and we really had no bad intentions and, this whole affair with Vida, I think we have managed to put it all behind us, we are here to achieve great success on the pitch.“I think that everybody now has this very positive image of Croatia, of our players and the way we behave and this is all that matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad9339ea77e9418c0447d4577944f31625ac1b9/0_9_2154_1292/master/2154.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82bc88d8c3afc6f9d5158d06f518bc1e","title":"xherdan shaqiri to complete 13m move to liverpool in matter of days transfer window","story":"• Forward underwent medical on Merseyside on Friday• 26-year-old is Liverpool’s third signing of the summerXherdan Shaqiri has been confirmed as Liverpool’s third summer signing, having interrupted a holiday to finalise his move to Anfield.Liverpool agreed a £13m fee with Stoke City for the Switzerland international this week and, with personal terms also agreed, the 26-year-old cut short a post-World Cup holiday to undergo a medical on Merseyside on Friday. The former Bayern Munich and Internazionale winger follows Naby Keita and Fabinho in strengthening Jürgen Klopp’s squad this summer. He has signed a “long-term” deal at Anfield.Speaking to Liverpoolfc, Shaqiri said: “I’m very happy to be here. It’s a huge club with big history, big players and a fantastic coach. So I’m really glad and happy to be here.“As a player you always want to be on the biggest stage in football. A few years ago I wanted to come too but it didn’t happen. I’m really happy that now I’m finally here. I want to improve myself too, I want to be with the best and I want to win titles. That’s what I’m here for.”Liverpool’s manager Klopp told the club’s official website: “I think the English phrase to explain the decision to sign Xherdan is a ‘no-brainer’. When someone like him becomes available in this way you have to react if you are smart – and we have.“He has speed and ability, has the right amount of arrogance on the football pitch, real bravery to want the ball and influence things. To play for us these are mandatory requirements.“We are the perfect move for him in this moment as well I think, because he needs to push himself and challenge himself and our environment encourages that. We will want him to express himself but also learn and improve the areas of his game where he can still make progression.”Shaqiri had two years remaining on his Stoke contract but made clear his intentions to leave following the club’s relegation from the Premier League last season. Stoke’s relegation activated a release clause that made him an attractive, cut-price proposition for several clubs across Europe, including Lazio, but his preference was to remain in the Premier League with Liverpool.Shaqiri almost signed for the Anfield club, then managed by Brendan Rodgers, in 2014 having fallen out of favour at Bayern when Pep Guardiola took charge. Klopp believes the player’s experience at the highest level and ability to play both flanks will make him a valuable option for Liverpool next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1925766906d686003734bd44dbcd6489b08b99fe/0_153_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9103889a2ec520dbb6ae02c5ed4f8c44","title":"englands dreams over as croatia take the next step world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss the end of England’s World Cup dreams, Bond villain defenders, third-place play-offs, West Ham’s transfer approach and FW live"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/242af7b00841aa9ff4a7494e127b3bea017a4435/133_1681_5007_3004/master/5007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=336b87b3b04cc765e7c9d18c7466d097","title":"nadiya hussain nigel slater ice cream french toast","story":"The TV cook on how the writer and presenter became her kitchen heroI first saw Nigel Slater on telly in about 1995 – the year my brother was born. I realised I already had one of his cookbooks, The 30-Minute Cook – I just didn’t know who he was.He had a recipe – his cooking has definitely evolved since then – for French toast using melted ice-cream. And I thought: “That’s AMAZING.” It was exactly the kind of cooking I wanted to do. Clever, waste-conscious, always useful … I’ve been following him ever since. On my shelf I now have Eat: The Little Book of Fast Food, Real Fast Food, Real Fast Puddings and last year’s The Christmas Chronicles. The latter is my favourite. I particularly love his fruit cake recipe – it is perfectly rich and fruity, and the only one I ever make now. Why use a different recipe when the one in his book works so well?Nigel’s cooking feels nostalgic. His recipes vary from super-simple and delicious to fancy and decadent. And I love that he can do it all. He uses ingredients he grows in his own garden, too, which has encouraged me to do the same.Apart from Delia Smith, Nigel Slater is the ultimate TV cook. There’s something about the way he comes across – he makes being at home look so effortless. I love to think I glide through my house the way he does through his.Of course, the reality is that it’s nothing like that in my home. We’ve got three kids (11, 10 and seven) and four chickens there’s always someone who’s sick, always something that needs doing – a plant you’ve forgotten to water, laundry to fold. It’s mayhem. I look at Nigel and think: “That’s what I want my life to be like.” And sometimes it is: there are moments when everything at home is where it should be, and I’ll think: “I totally did a Nigel Slater just then.” It doesn’t happen often, though.What is special about Nigel’s voice is his ability to evoke emotion. Even if he’s just writing about a baked potato, he can tell stories and make it personal. Whether or not the food is relevant to me, his writing makes me understand how it is relevant to him, which in turn makes me feel I know him that bit better. I can identify with him. I think it’s really important to feel some sort of connection to whomever you’re watching or reading. To my mind, no other food writer can do that.I don’t know how much Nigel still melts his ice-cream and makes French toast any more, but I do, all the time – I have three kids, so of course I do! You know when there’s a little bit of ice-cream at the bottom of the tub and it’s too hard to scrape out? I just leave it out to melt, then dip the bread in that (it already has cream and eggs in it, which is what you need) and fry it in butter. Any flavour of ice-cream goes. And my kids load it up with all sorts of other things on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

But it is acknowledgements of a non-musical centenary, the end of the first world war in November 1918, that run right through the two-month season and they also dominated the opening concert, given by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and its chief conductor Sakari Oramo.Conventional Proms fare – Vaughan Williams’s Toward the Unknown Region and Gustav Holst’s The Planets, in typically unsentimental, direct Oramo performances – made up the first half of the published all-British programme, while the second was given over to the premiere of a piece commissioned as part of the armistice theme, Anna Meredith’s Five Telegrams. But the concert actually began with another memorial, to Oliver Knussen, who died on Sunday at the age 66 his association with the BBCSO, as composer and conductor, stretched back almost 40 years. The five-minute concert opener, Flourish with Fireworks, made the perfect tribute, crammed with the busy detail and ravishing orchestral textures that typified Knussen’s exquisitely crafted music.Lasting around 25 minutes, Meredith’s Five Telegrams is a son et lumière, combining mostly abstract video images, created by 59 Productions and projected around the Albert Hall, with a score that calls for a chorus (the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, who had also supplied the wordless female voices for the closing movement of The Planets), extra brass and percussion groups (the BBC Proms Youth Ensemble) arrayed around the auditorium, as well as the Planets-sized forces of the BBCSO itself.But Meredith uses these considerable forces with great restraint and economy, in what is an exploration of the ways of communication during the first world war, and how they could be controlled and manipulated. Each of the five short movements deals with a different element – fake news and propaganda, censorship, redaction and codes, to the rather hesitant unbelieving way in which news of the final armistice was conveyed back to families and friends. The chorus is only used extensively in the second movement, when it sings the bland, formulaic phrases that troops at the front were allowed to use on their postcards back home, and really the visuals add little to it all, except a frisson to some of the climaxes. The lingering images come from Meredith’s music – the clashing, grinding riffs, and occasional moments of tender intimacy shorn of cosmetics, it’s strong enough to stand on its own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1576dc2b0c118f479106eb31e05a1f61bbb4675f/0_217_4887_2931/master/4887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72fbb0ce63105b951556d3bdcd4f7cbf","title":"the 10 best paul simon albums ranked","story":"As the singer plays his last ever UK shows this week, we rank his greatest albums, from 1965’s Paul Simon Songbook to 2016’s Stranger to StrangerThis summer, Paul Simon brings his touring career to an end – 54 years after he thought it was over. When Simon and Garfunkel’s 1964 debut sank without a trace, the 24-year-old travelled to England, miserable and dejected, and shrugged out this solo album. Several tracks – including Kathy’s Song and I Am a Rock – now rank among his best-loved songs.Although there are overwrought moments on the duo’s third album (7 O’Clock NewsSilent Night is eerily pointed, but barely listenable) there are others of stark, dismal beauty – particularly the yearning ballad Homeward Bound, also written during Simon’s time in England.“Hope and dread,” Simon once said, “that’s the way I see the world.” The two states of mind clash fervently on his fourth solo album, a premature reflection on his regrets – he was only 34. Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover, though, is deliciously silly.Although he must have the muscle memory to churn out a half-decent album without much effort, Simon has never done things by halves. On his lively 13th solo LP, he uses custom-made instruments, collaborates with Italian electronic artist Clap! Clap! and ruminates on the virtues of the word “motherfucker”.Kodachrome was banned from UK radio for its reference to a brand of film – a shame, because it is a brilliant, shiny pop song with bite. And there is plenty more to admire on Simon’s third solo album, particularly American Tune and St Judy’s Comet. “That may be my favourite album of the 70s,” he said. “It’s joyful.”After the failure of their 1964 debut, Wednesday Morning, 3am, Simon and Garfunkel’s career was shocked back to life by a new, electric version of that album’s The Sound of Silence. While the follow-up was hastily compiled, it was more assured than their debut, embracing a heftier folk-rock sound and showcasing Simon’s ability to dart between wit and desolation.There are a few intriguingly scruffy moments on Simon’s first post-Garfunkel album. On Everything Put Together Falls Apart, he turns from the microphone halfway through a line to scratch his beard, as if so deep in thought he has forgotten he is recording. It is fitting for an album of such candid introspection – although there are lighter moments, such as the samba-influenced Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.Flitting from gentle guitars to brash, experimental Moog, Bookends is Simon and Garfunkel at their poppiest (Mrs Robinson, written for The Graduate), weirdest (Punky’s Dilemma) and most agitated (Fakin’ It). The standout, though, is America, a wistful, fruitless search for the land of the free.From the chaos of Simon and Garfunkel’s imploding relationship came the best album of their career. The gospel-influenced title track is now rightly ubiquitous, and The Only Living Boy in New York – written after Garfunkel flew off to star in a film from which Simon had been dumped – is the most beautiful display of passive aggression ever committed to music.Although initially mired in controversy – Simon worked on the album with local musicians in South Africa during apartheid, ignoring the UN’s boycott – this culturally collaborative masterpiece served as its own rebuttal. Inspired by a bootleg cassette of Mbaqanga music, Simon incorporated his own melodic style and storytelling skill into the sounds he had fallen in love with, recruiting Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Gaza Sisters to realise his ambitious ideas. After the success of its lead single, the wonderfully peculiar You Can Call Me Al, the album took Simon’s career from its lowest point to its pinnacle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af59254ff2dc0b28ee6869045a5054ba5a2cf97/0_0_3500_2173/master/3500.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fc5936741863d1e1bb525028d36d6d86 2020w","title":"may attempts to woo openly hostile brexiters at chequers","story":"One hardliner accuses PM of trying to ‘butter up the butterable’ ahead of key Brexit billsTheresa May summoned several pro-leave Tory MPs to Chequers on Friday, just after president Trump’s departure, as she embarked on a charm offensive aimed at avoiding embarrassing defeats in two key Brexit bills next week.With a vocal section of the Conservative party in open revolt over Thursday’s white paper on the future relationship with the European Union, the prime minister is holding private meetings with backbenchers to try to win their support.One senior Brexiter described it as “an effort to butter up the butterable”, claiming that a number of hardliners had turned down May’s invitation. Two crucial pieces of Brexit legislation – the customs and trade bills – make their long-delayed return to the House of Commons on Monday and Tuesday.Tory remainers have laid amendments aimed at keeping Britain in a customs union. But with the debate in cabinet moving in the direction of a somewhat softer Brexit, after the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, all but the most outspoken are now wary of further destabilising the prime minister. Instead, May’s most pressing challenge is likely to be heading off a backlash from members of the well-drilled European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, chaired by ardent leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg, which has tabled a series of amendments. These are unlikely to pass because they will not get Labour support, but the government could face an embarrassing defeat if more than a handful of hardline Brexiters abstain from backing either bill.Labour voted against the second reading of the bills the last time they came before MPs and a senior party source said,: “We are treating both days very seriously”.The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed on Thursday that the two bills would be debated at the start of next week – though some at Westminster believed she was preparing to delay the discussions until after the summer break at the request of the chief whip.Davis and Johnson have so far been absent from the chamber of the House of Commons since they resigned over the Chequers compromise that May hopes will finally allow negotiations with Brussels to make progress.Both are expected to make a reappearance on Monday, with Downing Street watching Johnson’s moves, in particular, very carefully.No 10 felt May survived the spate of resignations with her authority largely intact and took the opportunity to reshuffle her cabinet, promoting remainers Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock. Her aides now hope she can survive until parliament’s long summer recess without too many more crises.A vote of no confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative MPs wrote letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the backbench 1922 committee – though many of her backers believe she could face down such a challenge. Under party rules, she would then be safe from another confidence vote for 12 months.The ERG was infuriated by the white paper. The 98-page document sets out plans for a “common rule book” for goods and food, alongside a looser trading relationship for services. It would also see high-skilled workers and students from the EU allowed to continue to come to the UK to live and work and proposes a complex “facilitated customs arrangement”, which would see the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf for some imports.Rees-Mogg has claimed May’s approach will reduce Britain to “vassalage”, echoing Johnson’s claim that such a deal would reduce the UK to “the status of a colony”.On Friday, Davis’s chief of staff, Stewart Jackson, who has claimed his reappointment to serve the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, was blocked by Downing Street, compared May’s Brexit stance to the historic error of joining the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).Britain crashed out of the ERM on Black Wednesday, in October 1992, after trying and failing to halt a decline in the pound, shattering the Tory party’s reputation for economic management.“Chequers could be another ERM. Voters are smart and have long memories. Such a fate can obviously be avoided,” he tweeted.For the time being, the ERG is not openly advocating a change of Tory leadership – instead using what one Brexiter called “Spanish practices” to try to force the government to change course.Davis’s number two at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, a former ERG chair, also walked out in protest at the Chequers plan and has made clear he intends to use every parliamentary tactic available to oppose it.Several other more junior Conservative figures also resigned earlier in the week, including two party vice chairs, Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield. Bradley, who won the marginal seat of Mansfield in last year’s general election, said: “If we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10.”MPs who accepted May’s invitation to her country retreat on Friday included the Weston-super-Mare MP John Penrose and the veteran MP for Gainsborough, Sir Edward Leigh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8faed7fdd221430ec2e48ed14d8d040bf4f319de/0_4_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7cd14155af060a1bfb9612df91242a","title":"leeds wakefield super league match report","story":"• Leeds 20-20 Wakefield• Champions blow lead to extend winless runLeeds Rhinos must now win both their remaining Super League games to stand any chance of avoiding a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers this summer after yet again surrendering a winning position to drop points, this time against Wakefield.Kevin Sinfield’s 19-year playing career with the Rhinos featured many memorable moments at Headingley but his first outing as a coach here will arguably rank as one of his more frustrating evenings. Leeds’ record eight-match losing run appeared destined to end when the Rhinos led by eight points with nine minutes remaining: but old habits, it seem, die hard.Kyle Wood’s try, followed by two goals from the boot of Ryan Hampshire, ensured there would be no winning return to Headingley for Sinfield – with this the third time in less than a month Leeds have collapsed from a winning position to drop a point.At least they arrested their losing run, which gave Sinfield something to hold on to. “We’re not quite ready to win yet,” he said. “But after that showing, we’re on track and can fix things up.”Wakefield would have arguably been favourites to finish ninth had they lost here - but this dramatic fightback alleviates the pressure on them without doubt. “I’m very happy with the point,” their coach, Chris Chester said. “That’s what we’re all about.”In a game with the stakes so high it was perhaps no surprise neither side produced their best all evening – but the greater moments of promise in the first half came from the hosts. They led 18-12 thanks to tries for Ryan Hall, Ash Handley and Richie Myler: and, given their dominance, they should have been further ahead.As it was, Wakefield made them pay. All Leeds could muster after half-time was a penalty from the boot of Liam Sutcliffe and, while this was undoubtedly an improved effort from Leeds, Wakefield produced a compelling fightback to deny them victory.First, Wood claimed his own kick which Hampshire converted - before the scrum-half added a late penalty of his own in the final moments to secure a point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8b2c1fc7936692ecad2fd9078f35772e3efd0e/1419_985_3765_2259/master/3765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4f00ab7a51279a3e8f0e598e02fccae","title":"tour de france stage seven report dylan groenewegen chartres","story":"• Lotto NL-Jumbo man beats Fernando Gaviria and Peter Sagan• Greg Van Avermaet retains yellow jersey for BMCThe 2018 Tour de France turned east with a soporific stage, so lacking in action that it would have been welcomed by insomniacs. The 231km trawl, the longest of the race, through the Mayenne and Sarthe to Chartres, was enlivened only by the peloton speeding into the cathedral city for an inevitable sprint finish, won by the Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen (Lotto NL-Jumbo) from Fernando Gaviria (Quick-Step) and Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe). Greg Van Avermaet remains in the yellow jersey.But there were finally stirrings of past glories from Mark Cavendish, who was in contention until the final 100m of the sprint. “I was following quite good wheels, but it was choppy. There were a few ‘renegades’ about,” the Dimension Data rider said. “I was picking wheels and seemed to be a good position. When I kicked my power was pretty good but it wasn’t enough. Once Quick-Step and Bora go, I can’t match that speed. I had a little coming together with Alexander Kristoff – it might’ve been my fault – and it just stopped me dead.“I just keep trying, our backs are against the wall all the time here. It’s not going to be easy to win here but we keep trying. Also, if those cycling journalists talked about some really choppy riders rather than me, trying to get clicks, then we’d see who they really are.”On a stage so lifeless that the Quick-Step team’s Twitter feed was reduced to waxing lyrically about the grandeur of Chartres cathedral and noting the importance of Asterix to French popular culture, there was little to write home about.Bernard Hinault went on the attack, even in retirement, at defending champion, Chris Froome, over his salbutamol case. “The other day I was with a youth cycling coach and before races parents have been giving Ventolin to children who aren’t sick,” the Frenchman said. “People copy what the stars do.“I wish Froome all the best as he’s up against a lot of people who don’t want him there. Mentally it must be tough to have all those people booing.”“Water off a duck’s back,” Froome said at the finish when told of the Frenchman’s latest comments. “I certainly don’t hold any resentment. I’m not fazed by it at all. Over the years we’ve always come up against one thing or another.”There was further fallout too from Tom Dumoulin’s time penalty, imposed after Thursday’s finish to Mûr-de-Bretagne, when Froome’s rival slipstreamed his team car after suffering a broken wheel five kilometres from the finish.“I’m fine with the penalty but they have to impose it for everyone if they do the same thing as me,” the 2017 Giro d’Italia champion said. Privately Dumoulin’s Sunweb team feel that his biggest mistake was being caught on camera, while others using similar drafting tactics away from the cameras went unnoticed.Geraint Thomas meanwhile played down suggestions that his role within Team Sky had changed after he eased clear of defending champion Chris Froome on Thursday’s hill climb finish.“Not really,” he responded. “My role is just getting through the cobbles as best as possible, attacking it for sure, and getting into the Alps. I’ll have to get through the Alps and see how I am, see how Froome is and go from there. A hell of a lot can happen between now and the end of all that.”Sunday’s key stage over the cobbled roads of the “Hell of the North”, used in the spring classic Paris-Roubaix, is now looming on the horizon, and most teams are focusing on the sporting and logistical demands of racing on roads that are sure to create drama.Thomas, who won the Junior Paris-Roubaix as a teenager, knows the ruptured pavé well. “They’re proper cobbles and there is potential to be unlucky and puncture at the wrong time, which does feel a bit random. But it’s the same for everyone.Froome agreed that the stage would have all the drama of a mini Paris-Roubaix. “It’s going to be brutal,” he said. “There’s no two ways about it. Everyone knows that, everyone’s waiting for that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd29ecbc25f013dce2b66243e83861d97f797d5/81_202_4537_2722/master/4537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce6eaadd8775f885964ca5e423e9f176","title":"talking horses saturday racing tips july cup sands of mali","story":"Richard Fahey stunned the betting market by saddling Mayson to win the July Cup at 20-1 six years ago and now the Yorkshire trainer may be about to follow up with a rather more obvious contender in Sands Of Mali (2.15). The zippy three-year-old appeals at 8-1 for the highlight of a typically action-packed Super Saturday with 10 televised races.He may have been a shade unlucky when half a length behind Eqtidaar at Royal Ascot, having raced apart from that rival, and the ability he showed in two previous wins suggests he may be able to turn that around and beat the older horses he meets for the first time.12.45 Ascot At the age of eight, Line Of Reason is perhaps entitled to take a bit longer to reach his peak fitness but he has finally got there now for this season, judging by his recent success at Ayr.1.05 Newmarket Aidan O’Brien has an exciting prospect in Cape Of Good Hope, a full brother to both Highland Reel and Idaho. Time and distance will be the making of him but the way he made all to score on his third racecourse outing suggests his rivals here may have some trouble keeping tabs on him.1.20 Ascot Three of these finished close up in the Queen Anne Stakes at the Royal meeting but, while that was run over the straight mile, this round-course race presents a different test. Century Dream might be the one who copes best, having had the pace to score at Epsom on his previous start.1.40 Newmarket Having put together some useful form in big-field, straight-course handicaps, Mijack might be overpriced at 16-1 here. He beat a next-time winner when scoring over this distance on the Rowley Mile in April, a run flanked by two lesser efforts on softer ground.1.55 York Muthmir looks a safer option, for all that he’s giving a few pounds away to all these. He came up short by only a neck in a Group Three last weekend, the winner having had the run of the race.2.35 York The only course winner in the field and the highest rated on official figures, Dal Harraild is taken to score on this return to the track after a three-month absence.3.10 York It’s understandable that the Royal Hunt Cup was the early-season target for Bless Him, who won the Britannia at Royal Ascot last year. He wasn’t quite up to it but he ran well enough to suggest he can beat his rating in a more winnable contest, like this one.3.20 Newmarket From a yard just hitting its stride, Moqarrab could be fairly treated for this handicap debut.3.40 York It was interesting to see Master Carpenter staying on to some effect last weekend at Sandown, where the mile he was tackling was too short for him. He’s on a longish losing run but has dropped to a very handy rating in consequence and is a fascinating outsider for this, a race he won three years ago when rated almost a stone higher.

Spanning 150 years and running three and a half hours, Stefano Massini’s play traces the trajectory of western capitalism by following the fortunes of a single family. But where previous European stagings have deployed a vast cast, Sam Mendes’s production of Ben Power’s adaptation uses just three actors: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. The result is an intimate epic that becomes a masterly study of acting as well as of the intricacies of high finance. For most of us, the name Lehman Brothers stirs memories of the financial crash of 2008, when this Wall Street institution filed for bankruptcy: an event with global consequences. But Massini’s play traces the family’s progress from the arrival of three brothers from Bavaria in the America of the 1840s. Starting modestly with the opening of a general store in Montgomery, Alabama, they move into buying and reselling raw cotton and expand into banking, coffee and the burgeoning railway business. Power passes from one generation to the next, but there is a decisive shift in the late 1960s with the creation of a trading ision run by non-family members. Eventually it leads to the firm’s demise with the collapse of the mortgage bond market. You can see the story in many ways: as a dynastic drama, as a study of the decline and fall of an immigrant Jewish family, as a parable about the dangers of market deregulation. But, although Power’s adaptation studiously avoids giving us any lectures, it is hard not to see the play as an account of the shifting definition of the American dream. To the original Lehman brothers, arriving in what one of them dubs “that magical music box called America”, it meant that enterprise and hard work would be rewarded by success. By 2008, it had dwindled into delusions of infinite riches based on financial services. The joy of Mendes’s impeccable production lies in watching the actors at work as they switch genders and ages to evoke multiple characters. Beale starts out as the solid, senior Henry Lehman but, at different times, turns into a sprightly tightrope-walker, a decrepit rabbi, a flirty orcee. As Henry’s nephew, he assesses potential brides on a points system, in a scene that brilliantly demonstrates the limitations of the business ethos. It reveals a versatility we have not seen in Beale before.  Godley is no less extraordinary. He starts as Mayer, the patronised youngest of the Lehman siblings, and later transmogrifies, by donning dark glasses, into the ferociously entrepreneurial Bobbie. In the interim, he plays everything from blushing brides to recalcitrant toddlers. Miles, meanwhile, exudes an authoritative calm as the middle brother, Emanuel, but goes on to reveal the rebelliousness of later members of the Lehman clan and the rage of piratical traders. Es Devlin’s set is beautiful to look at: a rotating glass box backed by Luke Halls’ stunning video designs, which provide a black-and-white panorama of a changing American landscape. The final stages of the firm’s collapse are rather hastily handled. I feel it would be fascinating to know more about the subprime mortgage scandal, and the way the firm removed liabilities from its balance sheet to create a misleading impression of its stability. Otherwise, this is an engrossing evening. Not the least of its virtues is that it shows how, even at the height of Lehman Brothers’ success, the key players all had terrifying nightmares prophesying doom. But Mendes and Power are not offering a wise-after-the-event hindsight saga. As in all the best plays about finance – such as Caryl Churchill’s Serious Money and Lucy Prebble’s Enron – they capture the dubious excitement as well as the danger of high-risk capitalism. It makes for a remarkable evening, which offers a kaleidoscopic social and political metaphor while reminding us that one of the reasons we go to the theatre is to watch superb acting.•The Lehman Trilogy is at the Lyttelton at the National Theatre, London, until 22 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1759772f6d0056b5b15009ff1272d0370824f9da/821_608_2277_1366/master/2277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ec745280854a4cb7a423245bfcb4c09","title":"a monster calls at the old vic in pictures","story":"Patrick Ness’s popular children’s book about a worried boy visited by a storytelling monster has been turned into a new show by director Sally CooksonAll photographs by Tristram Kenton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26969e4f0830bf5f94e7c9a2fff9eaae66aeb103/0_219_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe60395689b511fc09339d9e6ef5c47","title":"jon favreau pod save america podcast obama speechwriter","story":"Jon Favreau wrote some of the greatest speeches of the Obama presidency. Today, with a runaway political podcast, he says he is grateful that Trump has inspired a grassroots Democratic revivalBy many measures, Jon Favreau ought to be a vision of despair, holding his head in an Edvard Munch scream of angst at a world turned upside down.He was the future once, a twentysomething White House wunderkind who wrote speeches for President Obama that laid out bold, confident visions of progress on race, inequality, poverty and the environment. Time magazine named Favreau one of the world’s most influential people in 2009. People magazine named him one of the world’s most beautiful. Cerebral, handsome, feted by the liberal establishment: it seemed a gilded existence – and then Donald Trump became president and set about destroying everything Obama and Favreau and their team had worked for, chipping the great liberal dream to rubble amid cheers from Republicans who now dominate executive, legislative and judicial power in the US.Fair reason, you would think, to curl up in a ball, whimpering about a lost Arcadia. But the figure who bounds forward, hand outstretched, in the lobby of a sunlit Los Angeles office, is very far from a quivering wreck. Tall and tanned, Favreau sports jeans, T-shirt, runners – no socks, this ain’t Washington – and a gap-toothed smile of unshakeable cheer.“I am optimistic,” he says, plonking on to a sofa alongside his dog Leo, a goldendoodle. “Trump has awakened a sleeping giant of people who had thought: ‘I don’t have to vote, or once I vote I don’t have to do anything else, and my life will be protected and everything will be fine.’ People understand now that democracy is an everyday struggle.”Favreau, his youthful optimism apparently undimmed at 37, believes a new generation of progressive activists and candidates will lead the way back to power with a “multiracial populism” that can clang a big, loud bin lid over Trumpism.“Donald Trump has energised the base of the Democratic party. There is so much new blood out there. They all bring … this freshness. They don’t talk like politicians or recite talking points all the time. They don’t seem another cutout that some pollsters created in a lab. They seem like real people because they are real people.”After Obama left the White House, Favreau found a second act in US politics with a massively successful podcast, Pod Save America. Freewheeling, conversational, veering from earnest to funny, the show is the left’s answer to conservative talk radio and the voice of the resistance. Now he is launching a new podcast, a 15-part series about the history and future of the Democratic party called The Wilderness. An apt title, since many Democrats feel as if they have been mauled by a grizzly. “I call it The Wilderness, but we’re not completely lost. It’s a party that is rebuilding and is rediscovering the grassroots energy that has always propelled it.”Hope and change 2.0. Midterm elections in November will indicate whether this is wishful thinking.Although no longer scripting lines for the president, Favreau has a hugely influential voice with Pod Save America, which he co-hosts with fellow Obama alums Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor. The twice-weekly shows average 1.5m listeners, mostly young liberals who with Jon Stewart gone from the The Daily Show, rely on the podcast for insider analysis, jokes, interviews, solidarity, swearing and, above all, catharsis.Favreau is the ringmaster who marshals topics such as Trump’s hirings and firings, North Korea, healthcare and immigration reform. Lovett, who was Obama’s chief joke-writer, injects wry, sometimes bawdy humour. Pfeiffer, who was White House communications director, and Vietor, who was the National Security Council spokesman, supply policy wonkery.“The podcast began because we’re four really close friends – the chemistry is the four of us,” says Favreau. What you hear are not carefully constructed personae. “It’s very us. For no other reason other than it was the easiest way to go – just be ourselves. When we started, we didn’t know how to do a podcast sojust talked like we usually talked. It was like, what’s the worst that can happen? We’re not running for office. So we just speak our mind.”There is no Fox-News-type humbug about being “fair and balanced”, says Favreau. “The whole basis of that propaganda machine was a lie from the get-go. Ours is like: ‘You know who we are, we worked for Obama, we’re partisan Democrats. We’ll base our arguments on the truth and on facts as much as possible, but you know what you’re getting, which is a liberal point of view. Because that’s who I am – I’ll always be an Obama guy.” Listeners appreciate the authenticity. “People are actually hungry for people to not bullshit them about politics.”The podcast is partisan, but allows for nuance, unlike Twitter, says Favreau. “You look at Twitter and think, everybody is so angry all the time.” He joins in, he confesses. “Sometimes you can’t help yourself.”The podcast includes “never-Trump” Republicans but draws the line at loyal Trumpers. “I don’t think it’s useful to have Trump supporters on who are just going to lie.” What about cabinet members? A shrug. “I don’t have a ton of interest in having them on.”When the hosts take the podcast on the road, performing in venues across the US and Europe, fans treat them like seers and rock stars. In Stockholm, Favreau recalls, the audience asked arcane details about an impending election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district. “There was more of a hunger to know what the fuck’s going on in America than I realised. Because it’s probably like watching a trainwreck.”And yet here he sits in his Hollywood office, breezy and upbeat. The reason is partly personal. Last year he married Emily Black, a PR account executive – “Pod save the wedding”, said drink kooziescoolers – and bought a Spanish-style bungalow in LA for $1.9m (£1.4m). Hollywood is a good place for liberals to socialise. After our meeting, Favreau was due to attend a preview screening of Sacha Baron Cohen’s new television series.And business, after a bump, is good. Inspired by Lovett selling a sitcom about family dramas in the White House, 1600 Penn, to NBC, Favreau set out in 2013 to try screenwriting, among other ventures. “Leaving West Wing to pursue Hollywood dream”, as the Boston Globe put it. But NBC canned Lovett’s show after one season and Favreau’s projects drifted.Trump’s victory in 2016 changed everything. Instead of keeping a dutiful distance from a Hillary Clinton administration, Favreau, Lovett, Pfeiffer and Vietor stumbled back into politics with their podcast. Each episode of Pod Save America, which debuted in January 2017, is estimated to generate at least $50,000 in advertising revenue, totalling about $5m per year. Their company, Crooked Media, now runs other podcasts, including Pod Save the People, focusing on social justice, Pod Save the World, about foreign policy, and The Wilderness, their new series about the Democratic party. Earlier this year, Crooked Media signed a deal with HBO for a series of hour-long TV specials.The company operates from the fifth floor of an airy, open-plan office a few blocks from Sunset Boulevard. A lobby adorned with a collage of newspapers and a glowing neon image of George Washington sets the tone. Posters, notes, talking points and slogans – “the blue wave is not a weather event” – dot walls.Favreau, a top-ranking graduate of a liberal arts college in Massachusetts, started out with John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign, then started writing speeches for an intriguing young senator from Chicago. “I would not have succeeded, and Barack Obama would not have succeeded, if we didn’t have a close personal relationship,” he says. His method was immersion. “I sat with him, typed everything he said, read every single transcript of every interview he gave, read his books multiple times. I just got to know him. I learned not just how he spoke, but how he thought. Once you get into someone’s mind you can write for them better.” The results, such as Obama’s 2008 speech on race, were, on occasion, historic.It feels like another era, says Favreau, swigging a water bottle and patting Leo. “Some of the controversies that Obama dealt with seem so small in comparison with what we’re dealing with right now.”His former boss remains “zen”, he says. “I’ve never seen him freak out. Even in the Trump era, his personality is never going to change. He’s focused on the long game.” Obama, he says, wants Democrats not to mope but to organise, campaign, vote. When I ask Favreau if he could conceive writing for the 45th president, he laughs, then sighs. “No, no I can’t. Trump – what he does well is identify problem, enemy, solution. He does it in very simple terms. Most of it is based on lies. But what he tells people is, here’s the problem, here’s the person causing the problem, I’m the person who can fix it.”Trump is also effective speaking off the cuff. “The rare times that Trump reads off a teleprompter it’s actually bad. When he’s at a rally doing his crazy, he at least seems like himself. A big problem people have with politicians today is they seem phoney. If you don’t seem as bullshitty as other politicians, it’sgoing to be an asset.”Favreau detects the hand of Stephen Miller, a White House adviser and immigration hardliner, in some speeches. “It’s a little less stream-of-consciousness ramblings and more ethno-nationalist, semi-fascistic.”Pod Save America talks about Trump all the time because he makes news all the time, says Favreau, and that is a problem. “We don’t spend enough time talking about what should the Democrats do to beat him.” The Wilderness, which starts next week, is an attempt to correct that. Progressives’ big mistake, says Favreau, was to relax after Obama’s victory in 2008. “People said: ‘OK, I hand you my vote, you go fix the country and I’m going to chill out for eight years.’” Republicans vacuumed up governorships and majorities in state legislatures and Congress, letting them gerrymander districts and control judicial appointments.In this media age, it can feel that history begins anew each morning, says Favreau. “We sort of forget all the things that got us to this place. It’s not just because Trump is president that everything has gone to shit. We’ve been having these same fights over immigration for over a century.”Progressives tend to prevail, leading to backlash, a pattern likely to repeat this time, he says. This long view makes Favreau relaxed about Democratic in-fighting. “It’s always been this jumble of constituencies and identities,” he says. America’s tumult reflects the negative effects of globalisation, reasons Favreau. “Even in good economic times, there are people working two, three jobs and can’t make rent. Until a party can address this, we’re going to have this instability.”Favreau advises candidates to avoid Trump-bashing monomania, but does not fret about publicly shaming Trump officials or seeking Trump’s impeachment, tactics that some party leaders fear will alienate swing voters: “I don’t think it’s going to make a difference either way.” Ordinary voters care more about healthcare, jobs and living wages, he says, citing focus groups. “Democratic candidates should be unafraid to propose very bold, progressive economic solutions and not worry that they will be tagged as too liberal or too far to the left.”Politics aside, the former wunderkind does have one, enduring fear: flying. “Yeah, I’m a control freak. It’s like, small plane, suddenly goes into a storm, bad turbulence, no one says anything. Not knowing the information freaks me out, like something bad’s going to happen.”Even here, it turns out, there is hope. “My wife told me if you lift your feet up you don’t feel the turbulence as much.”Does it work? He shrugs. “It helps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f4e3003bceb25acf2b42ad8ef04b8f1c37d5a7/0_0_5900_3539/master/5900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddb3b947b2e2ddf1308828d4ce7345f5","title":"sean spicer book i started to wonder if my first day would be my last","story":"Trump’s former press secretary recalls ‘Holocaust centers’, Melissa McCarthy’s impersonation and not meeting the popeFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s forthcoming book, The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President, to be published by Regnery on 24 July, includes scenes from inside the White House and other personal observations by Spicer that add significant context to episodes from the early Donald Trump administration.In his first news conference as White House press secretary, Spicer attacked the media for reporting that Donald Trump’s inauguration crowd had been on the small side. Despite photographs showing large stretches of the National Mall empty that had been crowded with people for Barack Obama’s inauguration, Spicer insisted that Trump’s inauguration had drawn the largest audience in history. In his book, Spicer explains that he took the lectern under direct pressure from the president to shoot down the unwelcome news reports – and that Trump was unhappy with his performance.“I went back to my office, expecting an ‘attaboy’ from the president,” Spicer writes. “Instead Reince was waiting for me and said the president wasn’t happy at all with how I had performed. He didn’t like my not taking questions. He thought I was hung up on the wrong issues. He wanted to know why I hadn’t run my statement by him.”Spicer reflects on the moment as a potentially fatal stumble. “Minutes later, the president himself called, and he was not pleased,” he writes. “And I started to wonder if my first day would be my last.”After Spicer’s performance in the Brady briefing room, actor Melissa McCarthy lampooned him in a Saturday Night Live skit, chomping gum, screaming at reporters and ultimately ripping the lectern out of the floor and charging with it at the media. The impression made Spicer a national laughingstock – but in his book, Spicer reveals that he was laughing along too.“Taking a deep breath, I went to the DVR and saw Melissa McCarthy wearing my suit, downing gum by the bucket (guilty as charged, but never at the lectern), and yelling at the media,” Spicer writes. “I had no choice but to laugh.”While Spicer, who also worked for Trump during the presidential campaign, does not spend a lot of time in his book on Hillary Clinton, he does offer his analysis of where the Clinton campaign went wrong. His book includes a play-by-play analysis of the three debates between Trump and Clinton. Spicer accuses Clinton, whose campaign produced an unprecedented amount of material on the candidates’ policy views, of avoiding “the issues” in debate number one.Leaving a commemoration of the September 11 attacks at Ground Zero in New York in 2016, Clinton stumbled and had to be helped into a waiting van. She was taken to her daughter’s Manhattan apartment, where she later addressed the media on the sidewalk. Her campaign later revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and she canceled a trip to California.In his book, Spicer writes that the Clinton campaign made a fatal mistake that day. “Had Hillary Clinton gone to the hospital right away, it would have been better for her,” Spicer writes. “At every turn, Hillary and her overly protective staff acted as if they had something to hide. Every email and Clinton Foundation scandal, every too-clever-by-half statement by the Clintons and their team, came together to define her in that moment as the soul of duplicity.”In May 2017, a Trump entourage including the president, the first lady, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and staffers down to the digital director, Dan Scavino, had an audience with the pope at the Vatican. But Spicer, a devout Catholic, was not invited. In his book, Spicer describes the moment, and how he asked Scavino to carry rosaries to the meeting for the pope to bless. The book includes a picture of the pope blessing the beads. At places in his book, Spicer simply admits to having made mistakes. At one news conference he attacked the Syrian regime by invoking Hitler, saying: “You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.” Asked by a reporter to clarify his remarks, Spicer struggled to articulate that the Nazis used poisonous gas to execute Jews at concentration camps, which he ended up referring to as “Holocaust centers”.In his book, Spicer describes the sinking feeling he had as he felt himself in a hole and unable to stop digging. “What had I done. Holocaust centers?” he wonders.The feeling deepens and deepens: “I read the body language of not only the reporters but also my own staffers along the side of the room. I was beginning to realize I had misspoken badly.”In his book, Spicer has only nice things to say about figures such as the disgraced former congressman Mark Foley, for whom he once worked, and the disgraced former cabinet secretary Tom Price. But one figure does capture Spicer’s ire: Anthony Scaramucci, the brash New Yorker whose hiring as communications director prompted Spicer’s resignation. In his book, Spicer insists he did not feel vindicated when transcripts and audio of a phone call emerged in which Scaramucci told reporter Ryan Lizza that he was going “to fire every one” of his subordinates and declared: “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock.” Scaramucci lost his job soon afterwards.“While alternating currents of outrage and amusement flowed through the White House in the aftermath of Scaramucci’s conversation with Lizza, I took great pains not to show any emotion and just keep doing my job,” Spicer writes. “Some people asked me privately if I felt vindicated. I didn’t need vindication.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a166d22f9667fc7235247bfa0de9019725622712/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=913b969d30111ee864ddd9c1655e7b8a","title":"assads forces retake daraa birthplace of syrias uprising","story":"Up to 250,000 people are in a ‘dire’ situation having fled birthplace of uprising The United Nations has called for unimpeded access to almost 250,000 Syrians stranded in the desert near Jordan and Israel, who fled as forces loyal to the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, entered rebel-controlled parts of Deraa.The UN high commissioner for refugees said 234,500 people had fled the violence in the country’s south since mid-June. The international body’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said their situation was “dire”, with no shelter or protection from desert heat and winds, and food supplies that had dwindled. It called on all warring sides to allow the passage of aid deliveries to civilians.The UN’s call came hours after a symbolic victory for Assad’s forces that illustrated the turning tides of the conflict. Syrian state media said they hoisted their flag for the first time in years in the rebel-controlled parts of the city after a surrender deal was agreed with local rebels, which included a planned handover of weapons and the exile of opposition fighters and activists. The city is the birthplace of protests that led to the civil war.“Units of the Syrian Arab army entered the district of Deraa al-Balad and raised the national flag in the main square … a declaration that Deraa is now clear of terrorism,” said the state news agency Sana, referring to the opposition groups as terrorists.Protests in Deraa in March 2011 against the incarceration and torture of teenagers who had scrawled anti-government graffiti on their school wall, sparked a nationwide outcry against the Assad family. A violent crackdown on protesters would later lead to an armed uprising.The victory over rebels in the cradle of the uprising is a powerful symbol heralding the military defeat of a rebellion, which aimed to unseat the Assad dynasty but was waylaid by violent government repression, the rise of Islamist extremists, the unwavering support of the regime’s allies Russia and Iran and the dithering of western powers.“People have accepted the reality that the entire world is fighting against the revolution, and therefore it cannot continue,” said one aid worker from Deraa who requested anonymity in order to avoid retribution from government forces that now control the surrounding province as well.Deraa province has great strategic significance owing to its proximity to the border with Israel and straddles the Jordanian border. Tel Aviv has warned it would not tolerate Iranian-backed militias close to the Golan Heights.The Syrian government announced an offensive last month to reclaim all of the province, where western-backed rebels controlled swaths of territory in what was ostensibly a “de-escalation” zone.But the Deraa offensive, backed by Russia, months after a brutal assault on eastern Ghoutathat involved the use of chemical weapons, prompted one of the largest single displacements in the conflict.Rebels quickly sought to negotiate with Assad’s Russian sponsors after the US, which for years had backed the southern rebels, said it would not intervene militarily to protect them. One western diplomat said the “moral hazard” of intervening in the crisis has increased with time.The surrender deal mirrors that in other parts of Syria: the handover of heavy weapons and forced displacement of those who oppose the agreement to the country’s northern territories, which are controlled either by rebel groups or proxies of Turkey.Government forces are expected to turn to Idlib in the north, where Islamist militias and al-Qaida-linked militants control territory hosting more than two million internally displaced people.Meanwhile, calls are mounting for lifesaving aid to reach those already stranded near Deraa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72068972c4666791842a7726c584e3833da923ed/0_549_3417_2050/master/3417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76081a5be02fa339809487583c135d2e","title":"say cheese why italy wont ratify eu free trade deal with canada","story":"Deputy prime minister fears piracy of protected foods such as Parmigiano-Reggiano Italy will not ratify the EU’s free trade agreement with Canada, the Italian deputy prime minister has said, potentially scuppering the bloc’s biggest deal in years. “If so much as one Italian official ... continues to defend treaties like CETA, they will be removed,” added Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which governs with the rightwing League. The CETA accord, the first major trade agreement the EU has signed since a deal with South Korea was ratified in 2015, needs to be approved by all 28 EU member states to take full effect. The M5SLeague government, which took office on 1 June, has pledged to take a hard line to defend Italian speciality foods. The agriculture minister,Gian Marco Centinaio, attacked CETA in a newspaper interview last month.Italy has the most food products with protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication labels in the EU. These include Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham. Under CETA, Canada has recognised more than 40 Italian PDO and PGI labels out of a total of 292.CETA came into force on a provisional basis in September 2017, sweeping away tariffs on a large number of goods and widening access to Canadian beef in Europe and EU cheese and wine in Canada. Some farm associations and critics in European states have expressed concerns about the threat of rapidly rising pork and beef imports from Canada. Coldiretti, the association of Italian agricultural companies Di Maio was addressing, has called CETA “wrong and risky” for Italy. It says Italian food exports equivalent to €41bn last year could triple with a serious fight against international food counterfeiting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddeb04e2f2fcf4666287365ff9909b40bd8b31c1/64_217_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b50fb0a82c5ef67d6a4dae696be23bb","title":"wakaliwood inside ugandas action movie studio","story":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One inidual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born.The Ramon Film Studio, has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex?Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept.With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market.That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles.Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects.For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowed it.In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end.The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers where filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes.Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker.Eaten Alive is a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda.Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise, during the 2016 presidential election.A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie.I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound.

Now, the survival of what is believed to be New Zealand’s oldest living tree is threatened by kauri dieback, with kauri trees a mere 60m from Tāne Mahuta confirmed to be infected.Kauri dieback causes most infected trees to die, and is threatening to completely wipe out New Zealand’s most treasured native tree species, prized for its beauty, strength and use in boats, carvings and buildings.Amanda Black from the Bioprotection Research Centre at NZ’s Lincoln University, estimates Tāne has only three to six months before becoming infected – if he is not already – as his mammoth root system spreads in excess of 60m underground.An advisory panel was launched by the government in June in a bid to tackle the spread of the disease, but Black says the panel was the equivalent of “shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic.” She wants Tāne soil tested immediately to confirm whether or not the tree is infected, but this option is proving controversial. On Thursday, Black was invited to attend a hikoi for Tāne in Waipoua forest, held by the local tribe, Te Roroa, who prayed for the tree’s safety and wellbeing as the disease inches ever close.“We don’t have any time to do the usual scientific trials anymore, we just have to start responding immediately in any way possible it is not ideal but we have kind of run out of time,” Black says, adding that although there is no cure for kauri dieback there is a range of measures which could slow its progress.“Tāne is the nearest thing to a sentient being that we can measure time by. For Māori in particular, it is their ancestor. For them to lose trees like that is equivalent to losing family members,” she says.Taoho Patuawa, a spokesperson for Te Roroa, says solutions being discussed include closing the entire forest and felling nearby infected trees.Presently, raised boardwalks and boot-cleaning stations are the frontline defence, as well as conservation department rangers, Māori s and volunteers who patrol vulnerable forests. Last year Auckland tribe Te Kawerau a Maki issued a rāhui (temporary ban) over the Waitākere and Hunua ranges to the west of Auckland, prohibiting anyone from entering the forest.Auckland council added its support and surveillance to the ban this June, but biosecurity experts say locals feel “entitled” to enter the bush, and are largely to blame for ignoring warnings and bans.“Closure is the best thing we’ve got, especially if the authorities got behind it and enforced it. The forest needs to rest,” says Black. Dead Kauri trees take on a ghostly white appearance in the landscape, and according to Northland residents, dead Kauri trees are now visible from all the roads surrounding the Waipoua Forest.“Sometimes people are overwhelmed and end up crying,” Vanessa Rapira of the Te Roroa tribe told the  last year.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Night-time water restrictions will come into force in Dublin city centre and 33 suburbs across the greater Dublin area on Monday, Irish Water has confirmed.Pressure will be cut across Dublin for seven hours each night, with some households having only a “trickle” at the kitchen sink from 10pm until 5am. The restrictions will initially be in place for a week.Most of the affected suburbs are on the southside of the city, with just nine northside suburbs due to be hit with restrictions. While the restrictions will stretch through south Dublin all the way to Bray in north Wicklow, Beaumont will the most northerly suburb effected.Most households will experience low night-time pressures, but “no loss of supply” Irish Water said. However, supply to some customers on high ground and at remote end of networks “may reduce to trickle at kitchen sink”.In apartments, customers may experience low night-time pressures, depending on their building’s pumping and storage system, the utility said.There has been no significant rain for three weeks and the country is experiencing a drought. Met Éireann’s yellow status drought advisory was in place until midday on Friday.Met Éireann said it will be generally misty and cloudy over the weekend, with some hazy sunshine and scattered showers. Highest temperatures will be between 23 and 25 degrees with cooler conditions in Atlantic coastal areas.Kate Gannon, corporate affairs manager with Irish Water, said the restrictions will result in lower water pressure in some areas of Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare between midnight and 5am.Ms Gannon said there were already restrictions in 25 areas around the country. She said even if there was two weeks of heavy rainfall it would be soaked up by the parched ground immediately and would not see water sources replenished.“We need to get the soilmoisture deficit to over 10ml to get water levels to begin to rise,” she said.Ms Gannon said there was a base amount of water that is used over a 24-hour period of time. Some of it is usage and some of it is leakage, reducing water pressure overnight helps to reduce both.She said the utility has contacted its top 20 commercial users to determine their commitment to reduce water consumption. Irish Water also has a register of sensitive customers and asked that if anyone is concerned about their supply to get in touch.If anyone suffers a cut in supply, they are also asked to contact the utility.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil on Thursday water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said of the 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 in potential drought conditions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3564342.1531504816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"water restrictions may extend beyond dublin irish water says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water said it was impossible to determine at this point how many litres of water would be saved per night as a result of the restrictions. Photograph: Frank MillerIrish Water has indicated there is a possibility of night-time water restrictions extending outside the greater Dublin area.Angela Ryan, water resources manager at the utility, said it was looking at “varying levels of restrictions in various areas”.“We’re looking at resource management right across the country, the amount of water available in supply and the demand for water,” she said. “Right now as part of the existing drought conditions, we’re looking at similar issues right across the country.”A number of areas across the country are already affected by night-time water restrictions from 10pm until 6am, including parts of Carlow, Galway and Limerick.Ms Ryan said the night-time restrictions will allow water conservation be achieved through a combination of reduced usage and leaks from the system.“It will be a combination of both but obviously leakages are over 24 hours and usage tends to be over 12 hours,” she said.Darragh Murphy, communications manager with Irish Water said the restrictions are at night in order to try and limit the impact on homes and businesses.“What we’re trying to do is put on those pressure restrictions and do that at a period of time that least disrupts the economy and people going about their daily lives,” he said.Irish Water said it was impossible to determine at this point how many litres of water would be saved per night as a result of the restrictions.Emma Kennedy, financial analyst and founder of Kenny Analysis, said the utility’s leakage figures were “off the charts”.Irish Water says it plans to reduce water leakage rates from 45 per cent to 38 per cent by 2021. The utility’s managing director, Jerry Grant, said earlier this year the Dublin network has a leakage rate of 37 per cent, amounting to 207 million litres a day.Pipes are being replaced at a rate of 1 per cent a year, the maximum possible “without bringing the city to a standstill”, he said.Ms Kennedy, who has done research on behalf of opponents of the Shannon pipeline plan, told The  “there will be major problems if Irish Water sticks with that target”.She said the 1 per cent replacement target meant “some of them will not to be touched for 100 years”.“Dublin will have a total nightmare in the coming decades with bursts and outages if Irish Water sticks with that target. It’s almost inconceivable that it won’t.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3564483.1531515976!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord a daring u turn on occupied territories","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Terry Leyden finally got the memo.  Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillVeteran Fianna Fáil politician Terry Leyden executed a very sharp U-turn in the Seanad on Wednesday after he spoke against the Occupied Territories Bill, which proposes a ban on importing Israeli goods from Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories.During statements on Palestine, Leyden agreed with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney’s decision not to support the legislation, sponsored by Independent Senator Frances Black.Coveney, on behalf of the Government, cited legal, political and practical reasons. But in particular, having done a lot of groundwork, the Tánaiste is worried his role in the Middle East peace process will be greatly undermined if the boycott is endorsed.“I have spent hours trying to build relationships with people who will be involved in decision-making that can bring about peace – Palestinians, Americans, Israelis . . . and many other neighbouring countries,” Simon told Senators. “I fear the consequence of Ireland taking a significantly different position from everybody else in the European Union and the world would be to suddenly undermine my capacity to be seen as someone to whom both sides can at least talk, even though I clearly advocate strongly for Palestinians all the time.”Terry Leyden, “speaking as a former minister for trade and marketing”, held a similar view.“I wouldn’t bet your dollars that this Bill will ever see the light of day or will ever become actual legislation, let’s be quite clear about that.”The former junior minister for trade in Charlie Haughey’s 1989 administration warned that a boycott would have serious repercussions and lead to job losses here. Brexit was also presenting a “terrible dilemma” and “we can ill afford, at this point, another trade war with another country that is legitimately elected.”Terry stressed that he was speaking as a founder member of the Oireachtas Friends of Palestine group and was simply urging caution. Like Simon Coveney, “my heart is behind this”. But less than an hour later, as the second stage debate was wrapping up, Terry rose once more.He then rhapsodised at great length about Michael D Higgins, who chaired that Friends of Palestine group indeed, Terry “was privileged to be lectured by him as an extramural student for two years in Politics and Sociology”.“I want to say, finally, our record is second to none and Fianna Fáil, in a unanimous decision last Tuesday week, made that decision, we stand by the decision and we’re supporting this Bill here in this House today.”It seems Terry finally got the memo. While Simon’s efforts to get Fianna Fáil to back off supporting Frances’s Bill came to nothing. We hear that last week he told Foreign Affairs spokesman Niall Collins that if the Bill passes it will jeopardise his excellent relationship with Binyamin Netanyahu and undermine all his work on the Middle East situation. They’re still laughing, apparently, in Fianna Fáil.The Bill’s second stage passed in the Seanad to applause from Palestinian farmers and their supporters in the public gallery, and a standing ovation from Senators.While many TDs and senators nipped off on a balmy Wednesday night to watch England play Croatia, business was grinding along in the Dáil. At around 10 o’clock, Independents4Change TD Clare Daly was called to speak on the Employment Bill. She was wearing a lovely sleeveless black-and-white dress. But what really captured the attention was what appeared to be a large but very cute Panda tattoo on her upper arm. It’s swinging on a bamboo branch. You don’t get many pandas in Dublin Fingal. Tattoos being displayed by fuddy-duddy Oireachtas members would have once seemed unthinkable. Not anymore. But Clare’s cuddly panda is not a patch on the extensive artwork adorning the arms of the two most-inked politicians in Leinster House – Sinn Féin’s Jonathan O’Brien and Independent Senator Lynn Ruane.Meanwhile, there was quite a gallop up to Glencairn – the British Ambassador’s residence – on Tuesday night for the Harry and Meghan garden party. Politicians were mad keen to rub shoulders with the celebrity royals. Judging by some of the photographs, Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien appeared to land himself a job as a bouncer. Images of Meghan walking out the door of the residence show the TD for Fingal with his back pressed against the wall and peering into the crowd as if he is part of the security detail. He tweeted a picture with the message, “Happy to play my part in making sure yesterday’s event at the British Embassy went smoothly.” His colleague Barry Cowen quickly replied: “I’d heard Johnny Vegas was there OK.” Darragh is not best pleased.Former Trump spokesman Sean Spicer will be hitting the promotional circuit at the end of the month when his keenly awaited memoir The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President hits the shelves. He has lots to say, in a most complimentary way, about the Donald. This would explain why his former boss has praised the book, tweeting “Really good, go get it!”Spicy describes Trump as “a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow”. His breathless account of his time in the White House will be published on July 24th, but the  newspaper got its hands on a copy. He covers his six months as spokesman in great detail, giving his behind-the-scenes take on the most controversial and memorable episodes from the chaotic early days of Trump’s presidency.There is, of course, an Irish angle from Spicer, who is a devout Catholic and proud Irish-American. He writes of his disappointment at being left off a list of senior White House officials allowed into the Vatican for the president’s audience with the pope. Of his “countless” exchanges with Trump, their conversation on the eve of St Patrick’s Day in 2017 is the one which “stands out”. He writes about calling the president at his residence.“Sir, just a reminder about the St Patrick’s Day event tomorrow – do you have a green tie?”“Yeah! Of course I have a green tie,” president Trump said.A long pause. “Well I have one in New York, but I don’t have one here.”“I’ve got an extra green tie. Would you like me to bring it in?”So Trump told him he should bring it in as backup in case he can’t get his tie delivered in time from New York. And first thing the next morning, Spicer “delivered the green tie to the Oval Office and set it on the Resolute desk”. Could things get any better for Spicy? Well, yes. Because he was going to see Enda Kenny a few hours later riding into the Oval Office on a green unicorn.“The eighth-grade boy in me had to pause for a moment and marvel at the fact that a kid from Rhode Island, who as a student had never seen the inside of the White House, was now making sure that the leader of the free world had the right tie to wear. The billionaire president wore my green tie that entire day, including to the events with the taoiseach. He must have liked it because I never saw it again.” Leo Varadkar probably saw it in March. Oh, the drama.Winston Churchtown was in foul humour on Thursday. He must have read Sarah Bardon’s report that his beloved Stepaside Garda station is going to be opened in a “modular” building.The Minister for Transport was just finishing lunch in the Members’ Bar with fellow members of the Independent Alliance (they have their own little spot just inside the door) when Fine Gael Minister for State in the Department of Finance Patrick O’Donovan came in.Finian McGrath, always up to mischief, looked at him and immediately hopped the ball. “Here’s yer man who wouldn’t defend you on Tuesday,” he cried. “You let him down. You let him down on Sunday,” he said to Limerick TD O’Donovan, who used to be the junior minister in Shane Ross’s department before he moved. It was widely known that the two men didn’t exactly get on.McGrath was referring to his appearance on Sunday’s The Week in Politics when he was asked about the controversial Judicial Appointments Bill, which was delayed in the Seanad this week and now won’t be passed until after the summer recess. Ross aka Winston Churchtown has championed the Bill in the face of fierce opposition from the legal profession. He was reportedly not pleased with what he saw as O’Donovan’s failure to defend him on the programme.The bar was packed and TDs and Senators looked on as Winston became more and more irate and Finian and Patrick couldn’t stop laughing.“Is it true you’re getting a caravan for Stepaside?” Patrick said to his former boss.According to one onlooker, “Ross went into orbit”.“He was roaring at O’Donovan, calling him a bollix and everything. ‘You’re a bollox. You are a bollox,’ he said to him. It was hilarious.”Winston was fit to be tied. The other two were in fits. O’Donovan, still laughing, edged quickly out the door.The last time the Minister used such unparliamentary language was when he was shouting at Mattie McGrath a few months ago in the canteen. At least Winston didn’t have to listen to Senators bashing his beloved Judicial Appointments legislation.Pity poor Charlie Flanagan, the Justice Minister who was confined to the Seanad for much of the week listening to its resident legal eagles prolonging the process . At least he can escape to the Forty Foot or thereabouts for a swim, which is what he has been doing when he gets a chance on these hot days.On Sunday, after the National Commemoration Day ceremonies, he nipped off to Sandycove for a dip. As he was swimming around, he looked up to see Senator Ivana Bacik paddling beside him. She proceeded to grill him on judges and the legislation. Then she introduced him to her mother.Back in the Seanad chamber this week, both of them missed a great opportunity to address the other with the following greeting: “MinisterSenator, I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on!”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police link arms and battle Sharif supporters to escort 68-year-old former PM off aircraftEscalating tensions over return of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif ignite violenceFinding boys and coach alive nine days after entering cave \u0026lsquowas a massive, massive relief\u0026rsquoThe best of muscle and brain power from around the world helped save the 12 boysOusted prime minister Nawaz Sharif faces arrest on his return to country on FridayProtection of monument from environmental degradation a \u0026lsquohopeless cause\u0026rsquo, court rulesTwelve boys and coach lost average of 2kg during ordeal but they are in good conditionAyumi Kuboki arrested on suspicion of injecting disinfectant into intravenous bagsWorkers scrambled to reach high ground after water levels rapidly rose in cave systemAll boys in hospital majority are in good health - two have suspected lung infectionsQ+A: How can children who can\u0026rsquot swim be brought through miles of dark, subterranean passageways?Japan struggles to get help to victims of the country\u0026rsquos worst flood in 36 yearsAn evening of exploration ends up in disaster after heavy rain traps 12 boys and coachLiu flies to Berlin for medical treatment after eight years under house arrestTokyo Letter: Proving rape is very difficult here but one victim, Shiori Ito, is undeterredOfficials say conditions still good for rescue mission, with water levels in cave decliningHeavy rain has been followed by 30 degree temperatures, fuelling fears of heatstrokeCharges in landmark press freedom case carry maximum penalty of 14 years\u0027We will have to do the next mission as successfully as the one we did today\u0027Boys were each led by two ers as they travelled 4km through pitch darkness"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3564100.1531506587!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"las vegas offers a brief glimpse of an alternative united states","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t\u0027The Rat Pack Is Back\u0027 - \u0027The three-man cast – representing Sammy Davis jnr, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin – bounds on to the stage, and I am captivated.\u0027As the sun sinks behind the mountains surrounding Las Vegas, one by one the lights on the city’s famous strip flicker on. New York may claim to be the city that never sleeps, but it is Las Vegas that truly comes alive at sunset.The gaudy signs and faux Eiffel Tower somehow take on a majestic air as dusk approaches. As tourists swap their sneakers and backpacks for glad rags and high heels, the city shifts up a gear. It is with this spirit of joie de vivre and promise of what the night might bring that I prepare to step into the hot Nevada evening. Except, unlike my fellow visitors, I have not made a booking for one of the city’s famous shows.By the time I reach the top of the queue for the concierge almost all that is left is a back-row seat to see Donny and Marie Osmond, a front-row ticket for the Chippendales, and an array of seats for Matt Goss, who was briefly famous in Britain in the 1980s as half of the boy-band duo Bros.Sensing my helplessness, the concierge makes a suggestion: The Rat Pack Is Back, at 7pm at the Tuscany Suites \u0026amp Casino. After all, Las Vegas was the home of Frank Sinatra’s famous group of singer friends, he says with a smile. I go for it – even as my suspicions are aroused by his appearing to call a mate at the Tuscany to triumphantly declare another conquest. Still, how bad can it be?Half an hour later, as I struggle through a dim side street a kilometre from the Las Vegas strip, passing the sign for Goss on the way, I find myself at the Tuscany. Alas, there is little sign of the Italian elegance its name suggests. Instead I am directed through a smoke-filled hall of slot machines to the Copa Room, which is meant to re-create the venue where Sinatra and his band played at the Sands Hotel and Casino.This\u0026nbspCopa Room is in fact a small conference facility converted into a concert space through the ingenious use of velvet chair covers.With nowhere to hide as the drum roll begins from behind the makeshift curtain, I take my place among the audience of about 40 people, pining for Donny Osmond. And then the music begins.A full eight-piece band miraculously appears from behind the curtain, the three-man cast – representing Sinatra, Sammy Davis jnr and Dean Martin – bounds on to the stage, and I am captivated.As they move through the big, brash hits, waitresses serve cheap sparkling wine, and the audience begins to sing along. The three stars joke with the audience and crack not-so-funny politically incorrect jokes. “Hey, it’s the 1950s. We can say what we like,” one quips.Black-and-white footage of the old Sands Hotel, which graced the Las Vegas strip until it was demolished, in 1996, is a nostalgic reminder of another time in the city’s history. At its height the Sands was a mecca for the rich and glamorous. Sinatra’s famous acquaintances, as well as some shadier ones, flocked to the hotel.The film Ocean’s 11 was shot at the Sands, several albums were recorded in the Copa Room and Sinatra himself eventually bought part of the hotel and moved in. But despite the singer’s shortcomings – he fell out with the owners over debts, and the hotel fell into disrepute – the Sands also played an important role in the United States’ civil-rights movement.When Nat King Cole performed there Sinatra noticed that he never ate in the diningroom. He was furious when he discovered that Cole’s race was the problem, demanding that he be treated equally. Similarly, he insisted that Sammy Davis jnr be allowed to perform and stay at the hotel – an important statement on racial equality.Back in the modern-day Copa Room the band deliver one final rendition of New York, New York. As the show concludes the audience erupt in applause, and the cast line up at the exit to meet their new fans.The slot machines and smoke loom behind them, a reminder of the reality of present-day Las Vegas. But for these two hours we have been transported, however briefly, into the past, and reminded of a different, more glamorous chapter of American history.Read more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves around the world"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

He was one of the first people to see the boys emerge alive, as his job was to carry stretchers in and out of the cave.The er, 39, told The : “I helped with the extraction of their boys on their way out. It was fantastic to see them coming out.He said he has made “friends for life” with the other ers, who returned home today, and the Thai Navy Seals, who he lived and worked with in close quarters.Mr Acton was astounded by the bravery of the Navy Seals, who he said “understood they may never come home” from the mission.He added: “We need to remember Saman Kunan, the Thai Navy Seal that died, he left a young family behind, who need help.“I met his whole team, his whole team had worked with him since they were youngsters, I feel like by the time I left the team, I felt like I knew him very very well.They\u0027re so selfless, unbelievable people.”An Australian doctor who elected to stay with the Thai boys for three days instead of coming out of the cave also paid tribute to the Navy Seal who died in his first Facebook post after finishing the mission.It emerged today that the Thai boys were only supposed to be in the cave for an hour, to play after soccer practice, before the waters rose and trapped them.Their handprints from where they had climbed to higher, safer ground were the first clues as to where they were and what they went through to remain alive.Banphot Konkum, father of 13-year-old Duangpetch Promthep, one of the trapped boys, said:After an hour when they wanted to leave, the water level was rising. They ran further inside the cave to escape from the water. The water flow was strong.He added that all 13 rescued team members will enter the monkhood to pay tribute to Saman Kunan.\u0026#39Explosive device\u0026#39 thrown at Gerry Adams\u0026#39 home in Belfast\u0026#39Trump Baby\u0026#39 blimp flies outside Parliament as thousands of protesters march through London Donald Trump expresses delight at returning to Scotland ahead of golf weekend\u0026#39Morally bankrupt\u0026#39 care home owner jailed after defrauding wealthy retirees out of millions to spend \u0026#39fancy cars\u0026#39Radley College revolt over modernising headteacher who has changed 100-year-old crestChurch considers psychometric tests as experts raise fears about clergy narcissism Jihadist who used encrypted app to call for an attack on Prince George has been jailed for life Putin, immigration and the special relationship: Donald Trump\u0026#39s free-wheeling press conferenceDonald Trump \u0026#39berated business leaders in 90-second chats during Blenheim Palace dinner\u0026#39Suicide bomber kills 128 in Pakistan attack as ousted Sharif returns Court orders \u0026#39bin Laden bodyguard\u0026#39 returned to GermanyBigger health warnings on wine bottles will damage \u0026#39the soul of France\u0026#39 warn country\u0026#39s top chateausSuperchef showdown as Alain Ducasse threatens legal action against rivals for control of Eiffel Tower kitchensDonald Trump UK visit: President meets the Queen after declaring post-Brexit trade deal back on thanks to \u0026#39higher level of special relationship\u0026#39France beefs up security services and creates unit to monitor radical inmates ahead of high-risk weekendPolice called to home of Boris Becker after a report of dispute with his estranged wifeComment: Theresa May has a civilising effect on Donald Trump.

Discovering how quickly it has been growing since the big bang\u0026nbsp13.8 billion years ago could answer the most fundamental questions about where the universe came from and where it is going.But as the measurements have become more precise, they have also become more different. The results that come out of the different ways of measuring the rate of expansion are at odds with each other.Astronomers have a picture of where the universe was near its beginning, and a measurement of how fast it has expanded since – with those, they should be able to predict where it is now, but the result they get is wrong. That suggests there is either something wrong with the measurements, or with our understanding of the universe.Scientists had initially been concerned that the discrepancy was the result of an error in one or more of the ways that they are trying to measure the constant. But the new research suggests that is not the case, and that the measurements are correct – but that something undiscovered is changing the way the universe is expanding.One measurement comes from\u0026nbspESA\u0027s Planck mission, which mapped the universe as it looked only 360,000 years after it came into being. By looking at that map, scientists can work out the speed at which the universe came to be where it is today.But the new Nasa research shows that the expansion rate calculated from that data does not match up with the universe as we see it around us. The new data from the Hubble Space Telescope does not match up with the calculations from the Planck mission.The tension seems to have grown into a full-blown incompatibility between our views of the early and late time universe, said team leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. At this point, clearly it\u0027s not simply some gross error in any one measurement.It\u0027s as though you predicted how tall a child would become from a growth chart and then found the adult he or she became greatly exceeded the prediction.

It doesn’t matter what people say – the council leader had made up his mind, he said. He claimed the decision was based not on animal welfare grounds but was being used as “a political whip to kick people, especially Muslims and Jews”.The Lancashire Council of Mosques says halal means animal slaughter processes “must avoid all forms of stunning and the animal must be alive prior to slaughter”. The rules add:The slaughterman must personally invoke the name of Allah prior to every slaughterThe slaughterman must conduct the slaughter manually and swiftly with a sharp knifeThe slaughterman must sever at least three of the four arteriesGeoff Driver, leader of Lancashire council, said there was “much debate about what constitutes halal” and noted that in some countries “all animals must be stunned before slaughter”.A council spokesman said the move was not a “ban” because schools were free to stop using its catering service, and that its decision was based entirely on animal-welfare grounds.Asked why the decision was made in the face of opposition from two in three respondents, he said the consultation was not about whether to implement the move but about the effect it would have.Mr Driver said: We accept that a small number of schools may choose to use different suppliers for halal meat.“However, we hope that people understand how the council has arrived at this decision, which has been taken solely on the grounds of animal welfare with due consideration for the impacts outlined in the responses to the consultation.We would like to work with the Lancashire Council of Mosques to ensure that the meals we supply to the affected schools in future provide a range of nutritious options which satisfy students\u0027 dietary requirements and are acceptable to LCM, parents and governors.\u0026nbspHe added: The contract becoming due for renewal has given us the opportunity to consider the animal welfare issues surrounding the supply of halal meat, and on this basis the cabinet has voted to support the council\u0027s previous resolution not to supply unstunned meat, other than poultry, to our schools.”Mr Qureshi said they had offered to sit with council leaders to debate stunning processes - but said his group was not prepared to compromise on its no-stun position.He added that stunning animals was “unhygienic” as blood is believed to carry disease so should be drained from a carcass.The Humanists UK group strongly backed the council’s move, pointing out that polling by the British Veterinary Association revealed that 64 per cent of vets believed that welfare at the time of slaughter, specifically a requirement for stunning, should be a priority.16 Cincinnati Zoo worker shots and kills Harambe, the 17-year-old gorillaHarambe, a 17-year-old gorilla was shot and killed by a Cincinnati Zoo worker after a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe.

Both adult brown bears had been donated to Bern’s Dählhölzli zoo in 2009.In response to the consultation, the group said: “By providing non-stunned meat in its schools, Lancashire county council is arguably acting as an accessory to a breach of the law since the exemption from the requirement for animals to be stunned is explicitly only ‘for the food of Jews’ or ‘for the food of Muslims’,” and some meat would be eaten by children not from these groups.The policy begins at the start of the new school term in September.Dr Nick Palmer, of Compassion in World Farming, said: We fully recognise the importance of religious communities being able to practice their religion - this a central value of our society. However, this is balanced by the need to avoid slaughtering animals in ways that modern science has shown to entail great suffering.\u0026nbsp“Lancashire county council is introducing not a ban on halal meat, but a ban on unstunned halal meat. We believe there should be no exemptions, and the law should be changed to require all animals to be effectively stunned before slaughter, regardless of the slaughter method that is then used.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesFirefighters using fire helicopters fighting wildfires in Sordal in Setesdalen in the southern part of Norway.

That’s the question at the heart of the Malala Fund, the organisation set up by Malala Yousafzai, the young Nobel Prize winner. And she wants to provide this education in parts of the world where it can\u0027t be taken for granted. Luckily, she has a powerful ally.In January, Apple revealed a tie-up with Malala Fund as part of the initial goal of getting 100,000 girls into education in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Turkey and Nigeria. But today it has been announced that the collaboration is expanding to Latin America.This expansion means grants will be offered to advocates in Brazil, who will join the Malala Fund\u0027s network of so-called Gulmakai Champions. Their job: to implement projects created to empower girls, for example, through school enrolment efforts and developing skills development.And in Brazil there will also be a connection to the Apple Developer Academy students, encouraging those students to design new apps that can affect girls’ education – Malala dropped in on the Academy in Rio to launch this.I talked to Lisa Jackson, vice\u0026nbsppresident of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, about their connection. Ms Jackson, who previously ran the Environment Protection Agency for President Obama, is a persuasive advocate for Apple\u0027s involvement with Malala Fund, combining a forensic grasp of detail with an enthusiasm that is infectious.I think the wonderful thing about this partnership is that Apple is very much in the supporting role, she explains. Here’s an astounding young leader in her fairly young organisation. We have seen part of our role is to help build the base of support, so it can be around for a long time and be as effective as possible. We share the Malala Fund goal, which is for every girl to receive 12 years of quality education.Back in January, I met Ms Jackson, along with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Malala Yousafzai, in Beirut, when their tie-up was first announced. It was a remarkable day, with a group of Lebanese girl students who were thrilled to meet Malala – some burst into tears in their excitement when they discovered who was coming.When I spoke to Cook and Malala then, they talked about their commitment to this new initiative with considerable passion. The Malala Fund is trying to reach out to girls, as many as we can, to empower them through quality education. That was my dream, explained Malala.Malala breaks down in tears as she returns to Pakistan for first time since Taliban attackBut what has happened in the intervening months? Since it was first announced there have been many meetings, and collaborations and visits on both sides of the Atlantic between Malala Fund, and us,” says Jackson. There is a partnership which is now bigger than financial, including hardware and equipment, but which now extends to ways to try to engage our ecosystem.Throughout, Apple has refused to say exactly how much money it is giving. We’re not talking about a dollar commitment, Jackson says. It’s substantial, but this is much bigger than dollars. It’s dollars, it’s equipment but probably most important, it’s our ecosystem and support.This echoes Cook: We have expertise in education. We’ve built an expertise of what our products can do in a teaching environment and how they can fuel student achievement. And we have touched a significant number of people with our coding initiative. Of course, we have an expertise in scaling and we have lots of people in different countries across the world. So, it seemed like the most important things to me are always the values and the vision. It seemed like we could bring a lot in support of Malala\u0027s vision.”At the launch Malala added:\u0026nbspI\u0027m hoping that through partnership with Apple we\u0027ll be able to expand our work and we want to double our Gulmakai champions, who are the local advocates who are supporting the students, from six to 11 countries. I want to teach 100,000 girls and I want to involve girls and make sure that they can get quality education.Malala Yousafzai: her story so farNobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, activist for female education, in Nigeria in 2017.

I ask Jackson how that\u0027s going. We set the humble goal of reaching 100,000 girls in a year and I have no doubt that will be beaten. Apple has very much taken a supporting role in this, wanting to create something sustainable and which can be scaled.”This time around there\u0027s a different approach, as Jackson explains. There are more Gulmakai champions being added but we came up with an idea together that one of the things we could also add was the app ecosystem. We have 10 Apple Developer Academies in Brazil that have been there for a number of years. There are 500 students enrolled there now but hundreds more alumni, many of whom have just amazing stories and we’ve found that with these students at the app developer academies, we get great results when we frame things in terms of creating apps designed to change the world for the better.This seems like a smart move: the Apple App Store reaches hundreds of millions of iPhone users, for instance, so the right app can make a real difference. App developers are ingenious at seeing things in a different way - and at Apple\u0027s World Wide Developers\u0027 Conference last month in San Jose, 75 students from the Brazil academies attended as scholarship winners.Taliban leader who ordered hit on Malala killed in US drone strikeMalala Yousafzai returns to Pakistan for first time since shootingMalala says men like Trump should \u0027think about their daughters\u0027Malala and Apple team up to help at least 100,000 girls into educationThe incredible life of Nobel Prize winner Malala YousafzaiJackson says: So, we thought, let’s get Malala’s vision in front of them. Today, she’s been to visit one of the 10 schools, one in Rio de Janeiro, to challenge them to develop apps that affect girls’ education. Then Malala Fund will work over the course of the year to adapt these apps to make them impactful and judge which ones they want to use. It really is an amazing part of the partnership that goes beyond the classic donation of money and really goes to the heart of what Apple is about, to empower a person, giving any person the tools to pursue their passion.The challenge will also encourage students to find ways to better enable Malala Fund’s Gulmakai champions network around the world to communicate and share best practices in a secure environment.That challenge is only just beginning. But Malala has clear ideas about what it might achieve. “My hope is that every girl, from Rio to Riyadh, can be free to choose her own future,” Malala has said. “Whether she wants to be a developer, a pilot, a dancer or a politician, education is the best path to a brighter future. By tapping into Apple’s network of student developers, Malala Fund will gain access to new tools to support our mission of free, safe, quality education. The students in Apple’s Developer Academy programme share my passion for improving the world around us, and I am eager to see their innovative ideas to help girls in Brazil and across the globe.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Co-Director of Together For Yes Ailbhe Smyth speaks to the media after exit polls suggested victory for the Yes campaign.The demand is likely to cause friction with Italy’s European partners where migration is a source of internal political tension.Last week, Germany, Austria and Italy said they would hold talks in Innsbruck about how to shut down the Mediterranean route.Germany wants to process refugees in police facilities within 48 hours on its southern border with Austria, and in turn Austria has said it may be forced to protect its own southern border with Italy and Slovenia to stop migrants transiting from the south.Italy’s transport ministry last month said it wanted the EU border agency, Frontex, to stop working in the Mediterranean. Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France. Several banks, including France’s Société Générale and HSBC, refused to open accounts for the party last year.World news in picturesFirefighters using fire helicopters fighting wildfires in Sordal in Setesdalen in the southern part of Norway.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up. Many die en route.It’s time to get tough. First, remove their charitable status. Next, fine them or close them down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The veteran German MEP sits on the EU Parliament’s steering group on Brexit and wields significant influence in Berlin.His remarks will provide welcome cheer to the Government after its plans were trashed by US President Donald Trump in a sensational interview with The Sun. Mr Brok told German media: “This is a proposal that can’t be implemented par for par, but it’s nevertheless a good basis for negotiation.“It’s a reasonable approach. It hasn’t been talked about yet, but it really could be a breakthrough. We should really take this up constructively. Theresa May has obviously recognised the problems that come to Britain in a hard Brexit.”The comments come just days after it was claimed the PM told Ministers she coulnd’t alter parts of her Brexit plan as she’d already “cleared it” with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Mr Brok also predicted the PM would win against any leadership challenger and “then have a majority in parliament for better relations with the EU”. A senior EU official told The Sun it was “quite clear” that eurocrats needed to work constructively on the UK’s proposals.They said: “All the reactions for the time being were positive, because there’s indeed a shift in position, but also cautious. “The normal thing to do now is talk and let’s see what we can do. We’ll have to see if this can work. It’s quite clear we have to work on this.“The member states are cautious on this.

She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died a few days later. Gemma was just 40 years old.Simon had to tell their eight- year-old son Ethan that his mum was dead, and the two of them have been trying to cope ever since.Everyone mourns the death of someone they have loved and adored in different ways.There’s no timetable for grief, and no “one size fits all” way to get through the whole soul-crushing experience. For Simon, the death of his wife felt like a physical illness and being in intensive care.He decided to leave his job at Sky Sports to be with Ethan full time and they now both have an unbreakable bond.Simon is obviously very ­protective of his young son, but that works both ways.Ethan will often tell his dad that he is OK even when he is really suffering and missing his mum, because he doesn’t want Simon to worry about him, or to add to his dad’s pain.He sounds like a remarkable young lad who is a credit to both of his parents.For Simon, one of the worst things about Gemma’s death is the acute loneliness.After he has put Ethan to bed and he is in the living room, there’s no Gemma on the sofa watching TV or just chatting about the mundane events of the day.He often breaks down while making dinner for two rather than three, or emptying the dishwasher or doing other household tasks they used to share but that he now has to do by himself.It’s those little things that bind us together, and that we miss so very much.Simon told me that there are those who have simply not been in touch since Gemma died. It’s not because they don’t care, but because they just don’t know what to say to him and Ethan.It was interesting to hear him say that the most comforting sympathy he received was from a woman he bumped into in the supermarket, who knew Gemma from meeting her at the school gate.She simply told him that it was “utter crap, totally unfair and completely f*****g hellish”.And it is.When someone you love dies, it is utterly s**t and it does no harm to say that.Telling a bereaved person you are sorry for their “loss” is well meaning and comes with the best possible intentions, but we “lose” car keys, credit cards and dog leads.Those we loved are ripped from our arms and our hearts and it feels like the end of the world.Those feelings don’t really ever go away — you just somehow learn to live with them.We need to somehow try to make that process more bearable. So don’t avoid a devastated husband, a mother whose child has died or an elderly widow who is mourning her soul-mate.Talk to them and check in with them, because one day you will need them to comfort you.Essie, portrayed by Kaye Wragg, above, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, giving her no chance of ever having a much-yearned-for child of her own.Kaye gave her usual cracking performance, utterly believable and deeply moving. This storyline will have helped raise awareness of a cancer that is known as the “silent killer”.I hope we see more of Essie, as I always looked upon her as the quiet heart of Holby.If you missed this episode, make sure you go to the BBC iPlayer to catch up.WE’VE all had them – those house guests who overstay their welcome and are a complete pain in the bum.The disgruntled visitors who don’t like the food and complain the bed is too hard and won’t do a hand’s turn to help with the dishes or buy the odd loaf or bottle of wine.The ones where you do a jig when they have left and vow: “Never again.”So I sympathise with poor Mr and Mrs May, who have been putting up with the Trumps – veritable guests from hell.He’s the worst possible bullying boaster and you can imagine him dominating the conversation and being demanding and boorish.She has all the personality of a fembot and looks bored and disinterested at all times.Having the Trumps to stay was never going to be the easiest of rides for our PM and her husband.Aside from the thorny political discussions – and this week he has ripped up the rulebook and sold her down the river – there’s the distressing business of making small talk with this odd couple.I can just imagine Donald blowharding and manaplaining over pre- dinner drinks while poor Theresa becomes even more strained and develops a red stress rash on her neck.Her hubby Philip probably ended up talking to Melania about the weather.Trump has to be kept entertained like some bored little emperor, but you don’t want him to have too good a time that he will want to visit again soon.It’s a thorny one.Theresa has had the toughest of times recently, but she is made of strong stuff. While she might look a little tired around the eyes, our PM is no quitter – unlike the men who have let her down and put their own interests above those of the country.It might be trivial but I hope our PM can take some comfort in the fact she looked sensational in that sizzling red dress she wore to greet Trump.Theresa won the style battle with much younger ex-model Melania, who looked like a cut-price Belle from Disney’s Beauty And The Beast.Although Trump got it spot on as the Beast.FOR once this week, it wasn’t some poor actress who’d eaten a bowl of pasta for lunch and had a small, rounded belly being body-shamed.Russell Crowe was the subject of gleeful mirth by people who feel better about themselves by mocking others.Admittedly, the former buff star of Gladiator has piled on the pounds and looks like Thomas Markle’s older, larger brother. But by all accounts he’s chunked up for a movie role.Gladiator was 18 years ago and even Hollywood stars grow older and bigger. It appears, however, that equality in Tinseltown now means both women AND men being derided for not remaining visions of perfection and having the audacity to age.TODAY Serena Williams strides on to Centre Court to play for her eighth Wimbledon Ladies singles title.I have never seen a more majestic athlete on a tennis court since the heady days of my girl crush, Martina Navratilova.Serena is simply sensational and being a mother has made her even more hungry to win.It’s astonishing to think that just ten months ago, after the traumatic birth of her daughter and following multiple surgeries, she could hardly walk.Despite all she has gone through, I’ve never seen any athlete better prepared physically but also mentally.Serena can taste that title and no one is going to get in her way.I don’t envy her opponent, Angelique Kerber, today as it’s not just Wimbledon up for grabs.Serena also has her 24th singles grand slam in her sights, which would equal the record set by Margaret Court.Mrs Court was a hell of a tennis player but, as it turns out, not a great human being.She is a self-styled pastor in Australia and her views on gay rights and same-sex marriage are deeply distasteful.She claimed transgender children are the work of the devil, leading Martina Navratilova to label her “racist and homophobic”.So for that and so many other reasons, I’m firmly backing Serena today.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was also Donald Trump’s view in The Sun.But yesterday the PM convinced him otherwise. And she insisted “there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the world”.How are both positions possible? How will we enjoy such flexibility?How will our courts be supreme if we still heed ECJ rulings? How will we have total control of immigration if some EU workers can still come in as they see fit? And what will she do next if Brussels rejects it all?Leave voters’ rising anger is fuelled by the suspicion that behind the repeated assurances we are being stitched up.Mrs May must explain why we’re not. Explain how she talked round a doubting Trump. Explain how we will seize the opportunities Brexit presents. If she wants to admit her plan isn’t ideal but it’s the best there is, this is her moment.It’s time for honesty, not spin. The PM owes it to Britain. DO Remainers really not get the difference between President Obama giving his view on Brexit and President Trump doing so?Obama was egged on by Downing Street in 2016 to try to skew a democratic vote in favour of one side. He told us, falsely, that backing Brexit would put us last in the queue for a US trade deal.Trump’s argument in The Sun two years AFTER the vote was simply that Leave won and he doubted Mrs May’s strategy would fulfil on the verdict.He may be wrong. But Obama definitely was. Because once Trump replaced him, Britain hit the front of the US queue — a position only now threatened by staying tied to Brussels.Happy to help, Remain fans. WE wondered if President Trump might try to shoot the messenger when he realised how embarrassing his world exclusive Sun interview was to his host Mrs May.We’re used to that, of course.

We do need rain, but we are able to move water around the region so we can help those reservoirs which are looking a little low.\" The area has also been hit by needing to supply the emergency services with water for the moorland fires, but they have used sources of water that wouldn\u0027t usually go through the drinking water system.She added that any restrictions would need to go through a legal process for about two to three weeks before they would be applied to residential customers, not businesses.Just a mile away from the reservoir, the Edgworth Bowling Club\u0027s crown green is still green, but only just.Club chairman Mike Williams says he hopes that if restrictions are imposed, sports facilities like tennis, cricket, and of course bowls clubs, will be exempt.\"We are watering the green most days, sometimes twice a day,\" he says.\"But we are trying to do it responsibly and with as little wastage as possible.

I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member. I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after he got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"13 toe curling moments donald","story":"News13 toe-curling moments from Donald Trump\u0027s astonishing lovebomb press conference with Theresa MayDonald Trump has lovebombed Theresa May on his UK visit in a fawning, hour-long press conference after his shocking attack over Brexit.

Donald Trump has lovebombed Theresa May in a fawning, hour-long press conference in a bid to dig his way out of a shocking attack over Brexit. Last night the US President kicked off his UK visit with a bang by pouring cold water on the Prime Minister\u0027s \u0027soft\u0027 plan for leaving the EU. As they dined on strawberries and ice cream at a lavish banquet, it emerged he\u0027d said her scheme would kill any trade deal with the US. Today, in the hot sunshine of her Chequers garden, Trump smiled sweetly in a reverse ferret on a scale only he is capable of.  But he also created new headaches for the PM by casually ruling out a No Deal Brexit, repeating that Boris Johnson could be in No10, and lying - again. Here are the most toe-curling moments from THAT big showdown press conference.  The President shamelessly called his own words fake news as he denied attacking Theresa May over Brexit. Hours earlier, the President had claimed Mrs May\u0027s new soft Brexit plan would kill a US-UK trade deal in an on-the-record, taped interview. He told the Sun newspaper: The deal she is striking is a much \u0026shydifferent deal than the one the people voted on. Confronted in the press conference, however, Mr Trump said the story was generally fine - but claimed it missed out his positive comments. It\u0027s called fake news and we solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument, the President added. Once the Brexit process is concluded and perhaps the UK has left the EU, I don\u0027t know what they’re going to do but whatever you do is okay with me - that’s your decision. Whatever you’re going to do is okay with us. Just make sure we can trade together, that’s all that matters.  After humiliating her with his interview, Donald Trump was VERY keen to make amends. The President oozed praise, saying Theresa May is a terrific and incredible woman and his UK relationship is the highest level of special. He added he had breakfast, lunch and dinner with the PM - and they got on so handsomely I was very embarrassed for the rest of the table. Gesturing at her, he crooned: I also said this incredible woman right here is doing a great job, a fantastic job. He added: She will do very well. I think she’s a very tough negotiator. A lot of people are looking up now saying gee whizz, you know, she left a lot of people in her wake. 3. When he lied about Brexit AGAIN  I you remember I was opening Turnberry [his golf resort] the day before Brexit, we had an unbelievably large number of reporters there, he said. They all showed up on the ninth hole overlooking the ocean and I said what\u0027s going on. I think you will agree I said Brexit will happen, and it did happen, and then we cut the ribbon. This is a lie. Donald Trump went to Turnberry the day after the Brexit vote, not the day before. He told this lie in his Sun interview too.  Trump twice said Boris Johnson - who quit as Foreign Secretary this week in a blaze of publicity - would be great at Theresa May\u0027s job. The Prime Minister looked on with vague sadness as the President stood by his remarks - and dug himself even deeper into a hole. Trump said he was asked specifically about Boris and whether he would be a good PM, and I said he’ll be a great Prime Minister. He’s been very nice to me, he’s been saying very good things about me as president. I think he thinks I’m doing a great job, I am doing a great job, that I can tell you, just in case you haven’t noticed.  We know they are celebrating the special relationship. But Theresa May and Donald Trump are taking their close partnership a little too literally. As they walked to the podium for their joint press conference the President and Prime Minister held each other\u0027s hands. Whether it is truly a sign of their close diplomatic bond, or because the 72-year-old president needed a helping hand, it\u0027s becoming something of a habit. The Donald grabbed onto Theresa May\u0027s hand as he climbed up the stairs of Blenheim Palace for a black tie dinner in his honour last night. And they famously held hands in the colonnade of the White House 18 months ago. 6. When he admitted he hadn\u0027t read up about Brexit  I read reports, the President admitted, that claimed a US trade deal wouldn\u0027t be possible under Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan. But I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister’s people and representatives and trade experts it will absolutely be possible. In other words, he hadn\u0027t done his homework - and Downing Street managed to change his mind. 7. But had this perfect description of it anyway  That Brexit is a very tough situation, the leader of the free world said, poetically. That’s a tough deal between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things.  The mop-haired President apologised for his Sun interview - but he was a lot more revealing than Theresa May would like. When I saw her this morning, I said \u0027I want to apologise, because I said such good things about you\u0027, he lamented. She said \u0027Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s only the press\u0027. 9. But wouldn\u0027t reveal his \u0027brutal\u0027 secret Brexit advice  Trump kept awkwardly referring to a secret suggestion he\u0027d given Theresa May about how to negotiate Brexit. I did give her a suggestion, I wouldn’t say advice, and I think she found it maybe too brutal, the President said. Turning to Mrs May, he added: I don’t know if you remember what I said. We were none the wiser, but Trump brought it up again - and even insisted Mrs May might have to follow his advice one day. Maybe someday she’ll do that, he said mysteriously. If they don’t make the right deal she might very well do what I suggested she might want to do. 10. Apart from saying she CAN\u0027T have No Deal  Trump crashed out of his love affair with Tory Brexiteers by saying Britain CAN\u0027T have a No Deal Brexit. You can’t walk away, because if she walks away that means she’s stuck, the President casually remarked. You can’t walk away, but you can do other things. She can do what my suggestion was. My suggestion was respectfully submitted.  I think it\u0027s changing the culture, it\u0027s a very negative thing for Europe, the right-wing billionaire Republican declared. I know it\u0027s politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I\u0027ll say it loud. He linked it to terror attacks and security and called it a very sad situation, adding: We have laws that are so bad we don\u0027t even call them laws. Delicately contradicting the President, Theresa May said the UK has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country She added: Over the years, overall immigration has been good for the UK.  In his rant about immigration, Trump said: I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel, great relationship with Germany, but I think it\u0027s very much hurt Germany. He added: I think they\u0027d better watch themselves. Because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things. He also slammed Germany for relying on Russian energy imports, adding: It is a tragedy. I think it is a horrific thing that\u0027s being done when you\u0027re feeding billions and billions of dollars from Germany primarily ... into the coffers of Russia. I think it\u0027s a horrible thing that Germany\u0027s doing. It\u0027s a horrible mistake.

Backbencher Michael Fabricant - who has appeared on TV shows Have I Got News For You and First Dates -shared the crude image. It suggested Donald Trump had rigged up a blimp of two pigs having sex, with one pig displaying the face of Mr Khan, a Muslim.  The cartoon showed laughing Mr Trump in front of Parliament with the pig blimps tethered behind the Palace of Westminster, as  reported yesterday.  The caption read: “Breaking News: Trump defeats Sadiq Khan in balloon wars.” Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the Party’s former chairwoman, said Fabricant’s tweet showed the ‘extent of Islamophobia’ in the Tory party.  Labour MP Wes Streeting has written to Tory chief whip Julian Smith asking what action would be taken over the “grossly offensive, highly inappropriate and racist” message. And Mr Khan told LBC Radio: “I would expect that if a member of a mainstream party who is an MP to have tweeted what he tweeted, his party would take action against him.” Today, an enormous blimp depicting Donald Trump as a crying baby flew in the skies above Westminster, in a protest sanctioned by Mr Khan. Ahead of the protest, Mr Fabricant shared the tweet, commenting: “Well, what can I say?” He deleted it after a public outcry.  Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: “Surely Fabricant will have to be suspended for sharing this openly racist cartoon.” Today, Fabricant tweeted an apology, saying he had “accidentally tweeted a vile picture”, which had been sent to him by someone he trusted. “Because I was distracted in a meeting and saw it on a small iPhone I didn’t spot what it really was,” he claimed.

The president and First Lady Melania Trump\u0027s helicopter touched down at Blenheim Palace to a lavish welcome ceremony, which included a marching band and red carpet. The PM wore a long sleeveless red dress and many people spotted a white circle patch on her arm. The device is a diabetic monitoring patch, which is only available on the NHS in certain areas subject to local approval.  It involves a tiny needle under the skin which tracks blood sugar levels and sends the results to a phone or smartwatch.  The clever little piece, which is about the size of a \u0026pound2 coin, constantly monitors glucose levels meaning people with the condition don\u0027t have to keep pricking their finger to check. Created by Abbott, the FreeStyle Libre constantly measures a patient\u0027s blood glucose levels.  It allows patients to see if their blood glucose is going up or down, how blood glucose level changes over time and the past eight hours so you they can see what happens to your blood glucose when you sleep at night. The flash system is made up of a sensor you stick to your arm and a reader which is a small device you use to scan the sensor to see your blood glucose levels. There is also an app available which patients can use to scan the sensor, which usually last for two weeks.  On May\u0027s other arm you can see a mark which looks like she was wearing one there previously, and there\u0027s a similar mark just above.  The device is available on the NHS but only in certain areas and subject to local approval. The NHS advises anyone thinking of buying the system to consult with their diabetes team.  A starter packs costs approximately \u0026pound150 which includes a reader and two sensors.  After that, a sensor and a reader cost \u0026pound50 each.  The new technology was introduced back in 2016. Mrs May has been spotted wearing the patches on several different occasions.

Drew Povey and three other members of staff were suspended from Harrop Fold High School in Salford on Thursday after an internal investigation which has already lasted for several months. Tonight Mr Povey vowed to clear his name telling the Manchester Evening News: “I can confirm I am suspended.  It is completely and utterly unfair. I will clear my name and the name of the school. I’m speaking to my legal team.” Drew, 40, appeared to show commendable leadership qualities, humour, and support and passion for his pupils and staff in the hit series.  However, the M.E.N understands the manner in which the school was being managed is now under investigation. Mr Povey was the star of the programme, which was a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his school. He tweeted on Thursday: “Pressure is something we all have to encounter. Face it head on, do not allow it to phase you, keep strong, do the right thing and keep on going. Forwards not backwards is your destination. #HandlePressure #BeSuccessful.” Councillor Lisa Stone, lead member for children’s and young people’s services at Salford Council, confirmed members of staff have been suspended and said: “The matter is being dealt with according to the school and council’s procedures. “We cannot comment further but the council is supporting the school to provide stability until the end of the academic year. Our priority is the students and we will support the school to make sure their educational needs are met so they can achieve the best possible outcomes.”  Speaking after the TV show aired Drew - who has been at the school for 12 years and headteacher for eight - told the M.E.N he was pleased that Harrop Fold and Little Hulton were finally getting the recognition they deserve. He said: “The kids are absolutely brilliant and they and the school are getting lots of positive press which is exactly what is deserved. “It’s great getting all the exposure and people are really seeing the Salford spirit. That’s one of the reasons we decided to do this. “The impression people have of Salford, it’s all so heavily misaligned and the focus is always on gangs and guns.” “A big part of our decision making process was that we can now shine a spotlight on everything that’s brilliant and show people what an amazing place it is. “Everywhere has its issues but I love the place and I’m fiercely protective over the school, Little Hulton and Salford and I’m extremely proud of the kids and the staff.” He won praise for his handling of tragedy which touched the school. He vowed the spirit of Salford ‘cannot and will not be crushed’ after three children were killed in the Walkden arson attack.

A poll of 2,000 adults found a huge percentage struggle to correctly say the foods we tuck into every day with camembert, chorizo and fajitas also causing confusion. Other commonly mispronounced foods include quesadillas, foie gras and Ni\u0026ccediloise. It also emerged Russia, Mexico and France were deemed to have the hardest-to-pronounce foods, along with Poland, Italy and Spain. A spokesman for French bakery brand Brioche Pasquier, which commissioned the research, said: “Not being 100 per cent sure how to pronounce a word can put people in a tricky situation.  “It’s especially difficult if you’re in a restaurant or somewhere that you can’t get away with saying it wrong. “Our results found people are twice as likely to have a go at pronouncing an unfamiliar food word as admit they don’t know how to pronounce it. “This can lead to further embarrassment as people get more exciting and unusual words wrong, so it’s probably best to just try and laugh it off.” Researchers found nearly a third of the population struggle to say ‘brioche’ correctly. Nearly a tenth of Brits would incorrectly refer to it as ‘bree-ock,’ while a further one in five would pronounce ‘foie gras’ as ‘foy grah’. One in 10 Brits has pronounced the word ‘chipotle’ wrong, and a whopping quarter have come unstuck trying to say ‘quinoa’.

The account thought to belong to Dawn Cranston retweeted Warrington Wolves player Josh Charnley celebrating the fact he was to become a dad. It appears Cranston, jailed yesterday for the manslaughter of her son, even retweeted a post by Wigan Warriors player Sam Tomkins on June 30 2016 - the same day her emaciated son died.  The Twitter activity on the account then promptly stopped, reports Leeds Live .  Jordan, 18, died shortly after paramedics were called to his Farnley home.  He weighed just six stone and was severely malnourished and dehydrated when he was found lying in a soiled nappy, on a dirty inflatable mattress. He was covered in infected pressure sores so severe a bone had become exposed. A post-mortem examination found the teenager had died as a result of bronchopneumonia, caused by malnutrition, immobility and infected pressure sores. Jailing Jordan\u0027s mother, grandmother Denise Cranston and sister Abigail Burling, Judge Mr Justice Spencer said the teenager, who had learning difficulties, must have suffered a lingering, excruciating death. But during Jordan\u0027s final days his mum\u0027s Twitter account — @leedsrhinos123 — continued to retweet posts about her beloved Leeds Rhinos and Leeds United.  The believed account of Dawn Cranston, who was jailed for four years after being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence, also retweeted posts about children\u0027s TV and boy band Busted. Jordan\u0027s sister Abigail Burling, who was cleared of manslaughter but found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable adult, also appears to be a prolific tweeter. Wrestling fan Abigail appears to have tweeted during the days of her trial, which began on June 6, particularly about New Zealand-born wrestler Jay \u0027Switchblade\u0027 White. The account retweeted a post about White, who performs in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, yesterday, the day she was jailed for 18 months.  And on July 8, the account - \u0027Switchblade\u0027s Water Bottle\u0027 - tweeted: Past 2 nights I\u0027ve been having the same flash back and it\u0027s effecting (sic) my anxiety disorder, I feel like deleting everything and leaving.

Jordan\u0027s grandmother Denise Cranston, 70, was sentenced to three years imprisonment after also being convicted of manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court, on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old has been a firm face on Sky since 2010, but despite enjoying a glamorous TV career, has been left heartbroken after being sent a comment from a viewer telling her to \u0027lose TWO STONE\u0027. The tweet she was sent read: Either lose two stone in weight or stop standing sideways to the viewer, you really are needlessly overweight. Your circled picture on your [Twitter] profile shows how you were, so now get a grip, cut out the carbs and it drops off.  Nazaneen - whose wedding to BBC reporter Charlie Rose was attended by Eammon Holmes and wife Ruth Langsford and featured in Hello! magazine - replied via Twitter: Why is MY weight any of YOUR concern?

The person who wrote the tweet, and goes by the name ultimategrumpy, claims to be an author and has since been flooded with criticism for what he wrote. Nazaneen has also received more than 100 comments praising her, including from fellow Sky employees. Gary Taphouse, football commentator for Sky Sports, replied: What a repulsive tweet. Great response Naz.  And Sky Sports\u0027 William Esler added: Absolutely ridiculous that somebody would think it was acceptable to send that. Meanwhile, viewer Tony Strange said: Ignore him.

I immediately regretted giving him the satisfaction of my attention by retweeting it and I\u0027m ashamed to say it did make me cry. I know, stupid. But then I read all your wonderful messages and I felt like I had the longest, warmest, and biggest virtual hug - and that\u0027s why I love my job, because you all care about my weather forecasts no matter how big or small I am, or how sunny or cloudy it is!

Trump has given an exclusive 30 minute chat to Piers Morgan on board Air Force One before the president flew to Scotland Friday evening.  The interview will air on Good Morning Britain on ITV on Monday. But the news has not been met with the reaction Piers may have hoped for. I\u0027d rather gouge out my eyes with a melon baller, mate, wrote Daniel Summers, a medicine and health columist. Another said: I look forward to missing it! Thanks for the warning!

Just put your sandals on, eat some lentils \u0026amp smoke some waccy baccy. But don’t watch, it will only make you scweam and scweam until you’re sick.

The TV host tweeted: I’ve been on a few fancy planes in my time but nothing quite like this one.  Air Force One was held on the tarmac at Stansted Airport for 30 minutes for the conversation between the two. The interview is thought to be an exclusive for ITV and comes less than a day after Trump disparaged May\u0027s Brexit negotiating to The Sun. In that incendiary interview the American commander-in-chief also said Boris Johnson would be a \u0027good Prime Minister\u0027 and blamed London mayor Sadiq Khan for not tackling terrorism in the capital. The US president, alongside his wife Melania, enjoyed afternoon tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle before flying off to Scotland where he will spend two nights.  Before the flight took off Trump took part in an interview with Good Morning Britain presenter. It is widely thought Trump will play golf at one of his courses between now and his flight to Helsinki - to meet with Russian President Putin - on Sunday. Meanwhile organisers claimed 250,000 protesters lined the streets of London to register their disdain for the 45th president. That figure has not been verified. At an explosive press conference at Chequers this afternoon Trump continued to say Brexiteer Boris Johnson would make a good Prime Minister but also backed Theresa May\u0027s leadership.

The three-year-olds were left in the wooden crate with no pillows or toys for comfort, police who made the shocking discovery said. Pictures show the disturbing scene of the boys separated and unable to touch each other inside the tiny box which was locked with a padlock. The disturbing discovery was made by police officers in the town of Aparecidinha in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. Police officials told reporters they had received an anonymous tip-off that the two toddlers were locked inside the box and officers then went to the house.  The photo shows how the cops found the two boys locked inside the tiny wooden box which had a padlock and chain on it. The two boys have been taken to a shelter whilst the parents, both farmers, were arrested and taken to a police station on suspicion of infant mistreatment. Police captain Sonimarcos told reporters: The parents said they kept the boys in the box so they could carry out their tasks in the home and in the fields. But the space was very small and was even split into two so the brothers did not touch each other. Without toys, without a pillow and without any comfort.

And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well.

It’s really quite surreal,” she said. “It’s such a big responsibility because it isn’t one of my own series but I’m happy with it because I write for me and I write what I think is enjoyable to read.”The Mystery of the Skull is set in the same time and world as the previous 15 Secret Seven novels, which are also being re-released.It sees the gang attempt to solve the mystery of a skull that appears from nowhere in Peter’s bedroom.More than 50 excited fans packed into the shop – some to see Pamela, others excited to pick up the Seven’s next adventure.Among them was Craigowl pupil Jessie Gray, 9, who got Pamela to sign both her copy of the novel and her handmade autograph book.She said: “I’ve got all of her books and I’ve read one of the Secret Seven ones. I’m really excited to get started.”Suranee Abeysuriya, also 9, is already a big Blyton fan, having read all of the Famous Five books – but this will be her first Secret Seven.“I like the fact they go on all these adventures.

But these days the high street is packed full of ’90s throwbacks.“Celebrating Shout’s 25th year has given us all the chance to take that, often cringe-worthy, walk down memory lane. But it turns out we were all style icons of our time. It’s been amazing to see all the trends and reminisce about the music we were listening to and the programmes we were watching.”So just what were we all wearing back in 1993?All Saints, the girl band who formed that very year and are making their comeback in 2018, managed to make combat trousers look edgy yet girly by pairing them with crop tops and halternecks.Grunge was all the rage with tartan shirts – often worn tied around the waist – loose fit, ripped mom jeans and lots and lots of black proving popular.Doc Marten boots worn with oversized jumpers, denim shorts and tights, indie bucket hats as made iconic by the likes of The Stone Roses and Oasis, and the rise of chunky trainers – including the rather fabulous Reeboks Pumps where you could actually increase the cushioning around your ankles by inflating them yourself were also on people’s shopping lists.Now in 2018, it’s tough being a teenage girl – navigating social media and the pressure of perfection that comes with it, thinking about the future, juggling school work and friendships.But Shout has embraced this new digital age.

I’m not surprised if some of the posties were a bit concerned because they’re pretty menacing creatures at the best of times.”Royal Mail said deliveries were still being carried out as normal in the area, despite the change in personnel.Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said: “The safety of our people is paramount to Royal Mail.“Our postmen and women can experience difficulties out on delivery in some areas due to swooping attacks by gulls.“These kinds of attacks can occur at this time of year as the gulls are nesting and rearing their chicks.“Fortunately we have not had any instances of gulls attacking our people in the Douglas area of Dundee and mail deliveries have been taking place as usual.“We are monitoring the situation to ensure we can continue to deliver safely to customers in the area.”Gulls have proved to be a menace for people throughout the city in recent years.The Tele reported on Tuesday that wheelchair-bound Kim Ferguson, 36, had a burger stolen by a bird when it landed on her arm.Last month, 73-year-old Christine Kerr was taken to hospital after being smacked on the head by a gull in the city centre.Meanwhile, signs emblazoned with the words “beware the gulls” have been placed on bins in the city in a bid to deter people from feeding the animals.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"randy wolters leaves dundee to join nec on two year deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Randy Wolters has left Dundee to join Dutch side NEC.The 28-year-old still had another year on his deal at Dens Park but the two parties have come to a mutual agreement meaning Wolters could leave for pastures new.He has now penned a two-year deal with Dutch second tier side NEC (Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie).Wolters previously told of his struggles with homesickness having played all of his career in the Netherlands before joining Dundee last summer.He made 16 appearances for the Dark Blues.Before the move in a press conference today, McCann said: “Randy moving on is a possibility.\u0026#8220He’s very frustrated he didn’t feature more.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03971000/03971780.jpg","title":"New air control system to be based at Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspThe board has also committed to undertaking a communities impact assessment as part of it Air Traffic Management 2030 project which will run all activities covering seven Scottish airports \u0026ndash Sumburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula \u0026ndash from one centralised tower and surveillance centre.Hial managing director Inglis Lyon said: \"The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial\u0027 continued delivery of its core activities.\"We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required.\"Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective.

Scotland played some great hockey and showed so much commitment and determination.“We’ve really improved as a team, and our opponents actually commented on this, which is a great accolade.“We play because we love it, but winning makes it extra-special. We’d like to think it encourages people of all ages to realise they can be involved with hockey, even on the international stage”The event saw them take on the Netherlands, England and Argentina.After being beaten by the Dutch in last year’s European Championships, the team were determined to get the upper hand this year. But, despite playing the better hockey and pressuring the defence, they couldn’t get past the goalkeeper and had to settle with a 0-0 draw in the initial game.The Scots had been beaten comprehensively by England in the Home Nations tournament, and played with determination against them in their second game in the World Cup, conceding just one goal in each of the first three quarters.However, a late effort by England made it 5-0 — a defeat but a big improvement on previous games for the Scots.This game also saw goalkeeper Sheila, of Aberdeen Grammar School FPs, who at 75 is the oldest on the team and of all the teams they play, awarded Scottish player of the match for an outstanding performance.Despite having the majority of the play against Argentina, Scotland lost 2-1. This meant they faced the Netherlands again to fight for bronze, rather than meeting England in the gold medal battle.Scotland started very strongly and, as in the first game against the Dutch, put their defence under a lot of pressure but could not convert their chances. As the clock was running down it looked likely the game would be decided on running penalties but with 20 seconds to go they were awarded a penalty corner.Following the push-out and initial shot saved by the keeper, another shot was made by Jill, of Bon Accord, which was partially saved, but pushed over the line for a goal by Janice.Janice said: “Everyone went wild including the crowd who had been supporting us. It couldn’t have been a more exciting ending as frustration turned to delight that we had won the bronze medal. I don’t think I have been more relieved to score a goal. Although it was me who scored, being in the right place at the right time, it was a team goal and deserved by the whole team.”Babs Buglass, also of Bon Accord, who played a major role in the creation of the Scottish Masters 10 years ago, also played her part in all the World Cup games, having been called up from the reserves just a week before the contest.And there could be further glory for the city’s senior players representing their country as a further eight female hockey players from Aberdeen will be playing for Scotland at the Exin Masters World Cup, which includes categories for those aged 40 and upwards, at Terrassa in Spain in the coming weeks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pool-at-hawicks-teviotdale-leisure-centre-to-reopen-after-co2-delivery","story":"HAWICK swimming pool will reopen later this afternoon (Thursday, July 5) following a delivery of CO2.\nA shortage of the gas, which is used to control PH levels of the water, forced Live Borders to close the facility at Teviotdale Leisure Centre this morning.\nBut, since the delivery, it is planned to open at 3.45pm this afternoon to cater for lessons.\nLive Borders are confident other pools won\u0027t have to close if scheduled deliveries of CO2 are made over the next week or so.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"travel-a68-cleared-after-lorry-sheds-load-of-hay-on-road","story":"THE A68 has reopened to traffic after a lorry shed a load of hay on the road this afternoon.\nThe accident covered\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspA68 in both directions at the A697, near Carfraemill at around 1.10pm.\nA cleanup operation swiftly launched to remove the hay from the road.\nTraffic Scotland\u0026nbspconfirmed at\u0026nbsp3.10pm today (Thursday, July 5) that the hay has since\u0026nbspbeen cleared off the carriageway.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-see-inside-abandoned-galashiels-church","story":"A YOUTUBE video highlighting safety fears over an abandoned historic church in Galashiels is creating an online storm.\nThe video, filmed within the last fortnight, shows Galashiels resident Ian Macey jumping onto a flat roof and entering the 138-year-old St Aidan\u0026rsquos Church in Gala Park Road through an open window.\nIan highlights a lack of security at the building \u0026ndash which contains precious war memorials \u0026ndash vandalism, rotting floorboards and exposes its hidden health hazards such as asbestos.\nThe scenes have drawn criticism from some of the hundreds who have viewed the footage.\nIan told the \nBorder \n: \u0026ldquoThis is the second time I\u0026rsquove had a look around the church, after entering it earlier in the year.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove wanted to work in computer games from like primary school.  \u0026ldquoMy end goal is to try to get a job doing 3D somewhere, which is doable."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8010369.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wrong-site-for-youth-shelter-say-residents","story":"  North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.  A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.

Tranent\u0026rsquos Active Schools coordinator Adam Martin also presented information about both the men\u0026rsquos and ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Opens coming to Gullane before primary five students took part in a ClubGolf session, led by East Lothian Golf Development Officer Kate Green with assistance from Scottish Golf, Active Schools, the Stephen Gallacher Foundation and Beth Allen.  A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

In a speech to the Durham Miners Gala on Saturday, he will suggest that trade unions have been \u0026ldquomarginalised, vilified and undermined, and that children should know about union principles such as collective action and solidarity.  He will say: \u0026ldquoChildren should not only learn about trade unions and their rights at work, but should be fully equipped to exercise and develop those rights.  \u0026ldquoSchools need to teach these values and together we can, and will, transform society so it works for the many, not the few.  Mr Corbyn will also say: \u0026ldquoWe know that power in society, and in our workplaces, has become concentrated in the hands of a\u0026nbspfew, at the expense of everybody else.  \u0026ldquoBut history shows those at the top have never conceded anything, without it being demanded from people below \u0026ndash things we all enjoy but now take for granted, like weekends and paid holidays.  \u0026ldquoFor too long, trade unions have been marginalised, vilified and undermined, and workers have lost out, while more and more money lines the pockets of shareholders.  \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will restore trade union rights, but we need to also make sure young people learn about the principles of solidarity and collective action.

The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-new-boy-raab-caught-with-his-trousers-down-metaphorically","story":"  The well-scrubbed minister rose to deliver his first Commons dispatch box speech in a calm and considered manner when, after a minute or so, the chamber descended into uproar.  The only thing missing in this Whitehall farce was an MP in his pyjamas chasing a semi-naked woman through the chamber.  Labour MPs stood up, sat down and stood up again, pointing this way and that to complain they had not yet seen sight of the Government\u0026rsquos two-years-in-the-making White Paper on Brexit. Julian Smith, the wide-eyed Government Chief Whip, started mumbling in colleagues\u0026rsquo ears as a ripple of concern spread along the front bench.  The words \u0026ldquodisgrace and \u0026ldquoshame bounced around the chamber. Comrades Ben Bradshaw and Angela Eagle were looking up at the press gallery, gesticulating to members of the fourth estate to helpfully lob down their copies.  MPs\u0026rsquo indignation had been increased because HM Press had preferentially been given sight of the controversial document hours before MPs had.  As the tumult rose, so did the Speaker, crying: \u0026ldquoOrder. Order.  Referring to MPs\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoconsiderable unhappiness, John Bercow, in his usual non-patronising way, asked if the minister would rather stop so MPs could get sight of the missing document. Mr R caused more uproar when he suggested it was on its way.  When the Speaker pointed out how some copies had been made available to \u0026ldquosome people, MPs began pointing furiously at the hacks up in the gallery.  Mr Bercow repeated his nudge-nudge, wink-wink suggestion to the minister but the penny still did not drop. MPs anger intensified when Mr R nonchalantly noted how the paper was available on the Government website.  Seething Labour MPs started to walk out while others began shouting \u0026ldquoPoint of Order, at which the Speaker finally gave in and suspended the sitting until MPs could get a copy of the document they were supposed to be debating.  Later, Mr Bradshaw and others returned with boxes, theatrically flinging copies of the document to colleagues.

The firm wanted judges Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Malcolm to block moves to publish paperwork, saying the information contained was \u0026ldquocommercially sensitive and could help competitors.  Lord Tyre refused to allow the company permission to stop the inquiry publishing the documents, which includes monthly reports made during the tram project to the firm\u0026rsquos German HQ.  Lawyers acting for the company argued Lord Tyre had incorrectly nterpreted the law.  But in a judgment published yesterday, the appeal judges ruled Lord Tyre had acted correctly.  In a ruling written by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior judge, the appeal judges concluded the documents didn\u0026rsquot contain sensitive information that could damage the business\u0026rsquos interests.  Lord Carloway wrote: \u0026ldquoThe Lord Ordinary had some sympathy for the view that the respondent\u0026rsquos reference to the information being available to individuals who were no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group, was an irrelevant consideration\u0026nbspgiven that such employees\u0026nbspwould be the subject of contractual restraints.  \u0026ldquoHe held, however, it was not a material one. Whilst the court agrees with that reasoning, in fact the respondent was correct in its view, that the information would be available to those no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group.  \u0026ldquoIt is not an unreasonable assumption that there will be many former group employees who will have been involved in many projects involving similar information and reports, who have moved on to work for other concerns.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the contractual restraints, historical information on the petitioner\u0026rsquos working estimates and margins of the type under consideration would likely to be held by many working elsewhere in the civil engineering field.

The inquiry into what went\u0026nbspwrong has run for three years and cost \u0026pound7 million.  Bilfinger handed over the documents to the inquiry. But it didn\u0026rsquot want the documents to be made public.  The inquiry\u0026rsquos chairman Lord Hardie decided to publish the material because he thought it was in the public interest for it to be made available.  He ruled that Bilfinger hadn\u0026rsquot shown exactly why the information contained within the documents was commercially sensitive.  This prompted Bilfinger to go to the Court of Session. Lord Tyre concluded that the inquiry acted correctly.  The firm then appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. But their bid there has also been rejected.

Also, the Government\u0026rsquos proposed customs solution \u0026ndash the facilitated customs arrangement - will have a \"phased\" implementation Whitehall sources have suggested this will not be completed until mid-2022, two years after the end of the transition period.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, unleashed a fierce attack on the Government paper, saying: \"The overall consequence is that we will be a rule-taker, de-facto subject to the European Court of Justice and it\u0027s hard to believe that there is even a tinge of pink left in Mrs May\u0027s red line on this.  Suggesting the PM had broken her promises given in her earlier keynote speeches, he declared: \u0026ldquoWe have not known such vassalage to the continent since King John paid homage to the King of France in 1200.  The Somerset MP insisted his party leader\u0026rsquos policy on immigration meant nothing as it kept open the \u0026ldquooption of free movement by another name and added: \u0026ldquoThis White Paper has not needed age to turn yellow.  In a Commons statement, Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, said the paper set out a vision for \"a bold, ambitious and innovative new partnership with the EU, principled and practical, faithful to the referendum it delivers a deal that is good for the UK and good for our EU friends.  The Government, he explained, wanted to maintain parts of a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for goods to maintain \"frictionless trade at the border\" after Brexit and so avoid a hard Irish border.  While the European Court will shape the trade rules, Mr Raab sought to reassure MPs, saying control of laws would be taken back by means of a \u0026ldquoparliamentary lock on the process and that MPs would have \u0026ldquoproper democratic oversight.  A new governing body would police the new institutional arrangements through which, the paper said, the UK Government \"will represent the interests of all parts of the UK in this forum, ensuring the interests of the devolved administrations are taken into account.  But Fiona Hyslop for the Scottish Government said the paper offered \u0026ldquolittle reassurance for those worried about the impact that leaving the EU will have on our economy quite simply, these plans fall short and will harm our economy.  The SNP administration\u0026rsquos External Affairs Secretary said it would \u0026ldquoargue for much greater engagement with the UK Government to ensure Scotland\u0027s interests are protected\".  In the Commons chamber, Mr Raab\u0026rsquos first appearance at the dispatch box in his new role descended into chaotic scenes as Labour MPs erupted in uproar, shouting \u0026ldquodisgrace, because they had not had prior sight of the paper when the Secretary of State rose to his feet.  To make the MPs\u0026rsquo sense of outrage worse, it was pointed out how journalists had been briefed by Whitehall officials and had had sight of the policy document before parliamentarians got to see it.  Such was the tumult on the green benches that John Bercow, the Speaker, had to suspend the sitting until MPs were able to get copies, which were handed out by their colleagues from boxes obtained from Westminster officials.  Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer, denounced the Government\u0026rsquos handling of the launch, telling MPs: \"The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the Government is in such a mess.\"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart said the incident summed up the \u0026ldquowhole chaotic and clueless Brexit as prosecuted by this shambles of a Government.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe White Paper was supposed to deliver Cabinet unity, but all it has done, as we have seen, is demonstrate the divisions. Scotland did not vote for any of this, so can the Secretary of State perhaps suggest a way that Scotland might be spared this madness?  Mr Raab, to Conservative cheers, replied: \u0026ldquoWe voted in the referendum as one country and we need to respect it as one country.

City Council leader Susan Aitken said today that the authority is prepared to take action to ensure marches planned for coming weeks do not pass by St Alphonsus Church in the Barras area.  Canon Tom White was speaking to parishioners outside the church on Saturday when he was spat on twice and lunged at by a man with a baton.  The incident, which occurred as an Orange Walk passed by, has been branded a \u0027hate crime\u0027, has been condemned by the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, which has pledged to work with police to trace those responsible.  Today Cllr Aitken stressed her revolt at the incident, but insisted that the council has no legal authority to introduce a blanket ban on parades.  However, she confirmed the council plans to closely examine national legislation governing public processions, and called on the MSPs to consider how it can be strengthened.  She added: \u0026ldquoI am acutely aware that further parades are scheduled in the area in the coming weeks \u0026ndash and have made it clear to officers that the council is prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure those marches do not pass the scene of Saturday\u0026rsquos incident."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8067002.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-nine-hidden-gems-in-argyll-and-bute","story":"  Paddle Steamer Waverley  Join Waverley this summer for a magical journey.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try.

David Gill\u0027s secret\u0026nbspcurry recipes, gleaned from Indian crew mates in the Merchant Navy, are tempting return customers to drive the long and winding road to his door again and again.  After seven years at sea\u0026nbspMr Gill\u0026nbspworked as a roving marine engineer.  Then, when a back injury forced him to give\u0026nbsphis job up, he decided to follow his childhood dream and cook for a living.  With a garden shed sitting empty, he set to work transforming it into a takeaway, stocking everything from baltis and bhunas, to vindaloo, at \u0026pound4 a time.\u0026nbsp  The plan seemed the obvious choice as family and friends had long raved about his curries, to the point where he always\u0026nbspkept some in the freezer.  Now the 58-year-old, who lives\u0026nbspon the edge of\u0026nbspthe hamlet of Inverinan, where there are only ten houses, freezes his delicious dishes for customers to reheat when they eventually get back home.  Customers are much more likely to see sheep than people on the\u0026nbspsingle track road approaching the Black Rock take away, which\u0026nbspis 27 miles from Oban, four miles from the remote Argyll village of Kilchrenan on one side and the same distance to Dalavich on the other.  Now, with three seasons under his belt, Mr Gill, who is helped by wife Joanne,\u0026nbspsaid: \"We didn\u0027t know how popular we would become.  \"Although it is quite seasonal, when the school holidays are on we\u0026nbspget an influx of people from the holiday cabins at Dalavich.\"  Distance is no object for the takeaway\u0027s steady procession of loyal customers.\u0026nbsp  Mr Gill\u0026nbspsaid: \"A couple from Campbeltown, (a three and a half hour drive from Inverinan) are regulars customers,\u0026nbspthey take away a stack of curries every month, I think they drive here when they are doing their shopping in Oban.\"  The takeaway, which is usually unmanned, uses an honesty box payment system, so it can operate seven days a week from 10am -10pm and the couple have never had anything stolen from the shop, which also stocks Indian starters, chutneys, pickles and tasty desserts.  Mr Gill,\u0026nbspwho\u0026nbsptucked in to\u0026nbsphis first Vesta boil-in -the-bag curry as a child and his\u0026nbspfirst\u0026nbsp\"proper curry\" when he was a 17-year-old student in Tyneside, said: \"I have always been experimental with spices, when I was young I wanted to be a chef and learnt a lot of the basic stuff from my mother.  \"Then my\u0026nbspinterest in electronics came on and I was in the Merchant Navy as a Radio Officer for seven years, on board the oil tankers and that\u0027s where I picked up recipes and my love of spices, because I would sit with the crew and eat with the crew.  \"They would fish off the back of the vessel when we were anchored and then make a\u0026nbspred snapper\u0026nbspcurry.\"  He added: \"Friends and family used to come and have one of my curries, say it was lovely and that I could sell them. I used to have some stocked\u0026nbspin the freezer and they would say, can we take one home?\"  Now holidaymakers from all over the world call in at the takeaway, which now has two big freezer loads of frozen curries to choose from.  Mrs Gill, who helps with food preparation, stocking the shop and taking care of leaflet design and marketing,\u0026nbspsaid: \"As soon as\u0026nbsppeople see the sign, they stop and say what is this? I have heard them say, look at that, a curry shop - here?\""},{"url":null,"title":"flaming-bagpiper-and-scottish-resistance-member-detained-in-dungavel","story":"  Ryan Randall, 34, has been detained in Dungavel immigration removal centre in South Lanarkshire after flying into Edinburgh last night.  The kilted busker came to prominence after leading a pro-independence march\u0026nbspon the day of 2014\u0027s\u0026nbspreferendum, with flames shooting from the top of his bagpipes.  Last year, he was one of six members of the Scottish Resistance, a nationalist fringe group, who protested inside the Spanish Consulate in support of Catalonia.  Mr Randall, from Las Vegas, was hoping to spend the rest of the summer in Scotland but is now facing being forced to catch a flight back to the US on Monday.  Home Office officials insist he needs a work visa as he plans to busk during the Edinburgh Festival. They also raised fears he may never have returned to America as he has no other income.  But Mr Randall and his fellow Scottish Resistance members have suggested the move is \u0026ldquopolitically motivated due to his campaigning past.  Veteran street protester Sean Clerkin insisted: \u0026ldquoHe has been very prominent in the independence movement, and in the referendum campaign and beyond that.  \u0026ldquoHe has come over here six previous summers and there was never a problem. It\u0026rsquos absolutely ridiculous. He should not be in Dungavel. It\u0026rsquos an abuse of his human rights.  Speaking to The Herald from Dungavel, Mr Randall insisted he had never needed a work visa in the past, adding: \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos probably because of the independence movement [campaigning].  He said: \u0026ldquoI have never missed a flight. I have always been on time for my return flight back to America \u0026ndash and this is my sixth year coming to Scotland.  He admitted he did have a warrant issued against him after failing to pay a $1,000 fine for \u0026ldquoobstructing a pavement while busking in Las Vegas, but said this was not brought up by UK officials.  A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoNon-EU nationals seeking to enter the UK as visitors are not permitted to work.

Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.

The Council worked with the harbour to support its bid and roads and transportation teams are continuing to provide logistical support as necessary to both Fraserburgh and Peterhead ports.        Global energy firm Equinor and its partner Masdar recently unveiled their Batwind project in Peterhead, for the first time making it possible to store energy produced from an offshore wind farm.Electricity produced at the world’s first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, located 25km off the coast of Peterhead, will be transported via cables to an onshore substation where 1 MW batteries are placed and connected to the grid. The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away.

They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116297.jpg","title":"Sir Anthony Cleaver very pleased to see progress made by Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile he says he is sad to be leaving his role as chairman of the partnership, he feels the time is right for a change. He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected.

Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 13, 2018 at 3:08 pmThere’s plenty to see and do in Orkney, this weekend!

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Saturday 14 Jul 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768111.1531420726!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy where is bono in the world s hour of need","story":"        Once the world had a superhero ready to jump on his private jet at a moment\u0026#8217s notice, writes Jim Duffy.                There was a time when all we needed to do was click our fingers and great things would happen. In times of world crises, when the politicians couldn’t quite manage to pull things off in a timely and seamless fashion, we could turn to one trusted soul to sort it all out.            From The Troubles in Ireland to the townships of Soweto, this man could make things happen. He had the ear of British Prime Ministers and US presidents. He had more super-human strength than Christopher Reeves and more cunning than Batman. But, he’s gone now. And we need him even more. Yes, it’s time to bring back Bono...            I recall in my early 20s listening to the U2 album, Live at Red Rocks. The frontman of this soon-to-be super group was Bono. At the time, he had all the makings of an Expendable and Incredible, all in one small package. But this super-hero could sing! He would knock out powerful tones with cogent lyrics designed to make us think. Supported by his fellow band members, Bono grew to international stardom. This was epitomised by his fabulous and haunting appearance at Bob Geldof’s Live Aid. Or was Midge Ure involved there also? Yes, I’m pretty sure that Midge played a key role there Bob. But, he seems to have been whitewashed from the credits. Not for us Scots though.Anyway, back to superheroes. Bono stole the show with his rendition of the U2 song, Bad. He came into the crowds, just like Jesus and the early prophets did. He hugged some wee lassie plucked from obscurity. He broke the risk management and crowd control rules to be “at one with people”. It was just brilliant to watch. And despite my nervousness about his prophetic actions, I do enjoy banging it on on YouTube every now and then. Yes, Bono was on his way to world saviour.READ MORE: U2 singer Bono says sorry over claims charity staff were bullied            He made damn sure that he used his superpowers well. He had the ear of the people and the they loved him and his music. A bit like Russell Crowe in the movie Gladiator, where he won the hearts and minds of those in the Coliseum, causing the young empower some angst. Winning hearts and minds always works well and Bono knew this.He had massive global reach and could sing about anything he wanted. If I’m not mistaken, it was Bono and Jim Kerr from Simple Minds who got Nelson Mandela freed right? Maybe not that simple, but I don’t know who else did. Do you? But, alas, after all his caped-crusader efforts to free us from tyranny and the forces of evil, Bono has going missing.At a time when one of the most decisive leaders of the Western world lands in Scotland and the UK, I have to ask the question. Where in God’s name is Bono when you need him? Only Bono could release us from the grip of this Western oligarch. Only Bono could be strong enough to stand up to President Trump and say: “No way!” Only Bono could have us – the proletariat – hanging on his every word as he tells, no demands, politicians do the right thing.            But, he is nowhere to be found and perhaps he does not want to be found. Has this superhero gone forever?In the USA, another live wire and actor superhero has had a go at President Trump. Robert De Niro has been vocal pre- and post-Trump’s election.De Niro has stood on platforms and denounced Trump, stating he would like to “punch him on the face”. Powerful words from one of the best-known (fictional) gangsters in the movie world. But, on this occasion, I do not see this particular “luvvie” making any real impact. It takes more than making an impassioned speech with the f-word thrown in to have an effect at red-carpet dinners. De Niro has failed, but he gets points for trying. This now makes the reappearance of Bono so much more of an issue.READ MORE: Paradise Papers: Bono and Mrs Brown’s Boys star in offshore tax have claims            Only Bono knows that a superhero has to get off his ass and on a plane, albeit a private jet, to make an impact.  After all, no point in Bono queuing at Stanstead airport waiting for a Ryanair flight that may be cancelled due to pilot industrial action this month. And Bono was willing to jet across the globe with the likes of Slick Willy Clinton to get that “money shot”.  When Bono hit the tarmac, he made it count. No politician was safe. Any God-fearing politico that refused an audience with Bono to discuss the s*** that was occurring in their country under their watch was doomed.Wee Bono would be giving speeches, hugging babies and sitting down with rival politicians to make you feel bad. So, why endure the Bono treatment when you should just meet him and acquiesce to him?  This world feels like it is in tatters right now. Never before have we needed a character like Bono to get behind. He was fearless and knew how to knit it all together to create some form of outcome. But I don’t think old Bono will be coming out of retirement all that soon. He has fought enough fights and has the scar tissue to prove it. So we need another superhero who can gel us together. And it can’t be Gareth Southgate – yet.  We need a new superhero to coalesce around as he or she or they hold Trump and others to account. The problem is right now, I cannot think of anyone suited to the role. Let’s keep praying in the meantime..."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768117.1531420811!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment may s brexit plan is a bit like charge of light brigade","story":"        The Government\u0026#8217s Brexit White Paper has come under attack from all sides but at least provides hope of avoiding a disastrous \u0026#8216no-deal\u0026#8217 divorce from the EU.                “Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them, Volleyed and thundered Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell, Rode the six hundred.”            The Charge of the Light Brigade was an infamous military mistake, but it is sometimes forgotten that the near-suicidal cavalry charge actually succeeded in taking the Russian guns during the Battle of Balaclava in 1854.            In finally spelling out the detail of what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means with the publication of a White Paper, Theresa May has sounded the charge.Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg – along with assorted other hard Brexiteers – was quick to open fire from the right, declaring May’s plan to be the “greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”. And, from the left, Labour said the Government was in “a mess”, Len McCluskey, of the Unite union, said the proposals were a “fudge which pleases no one”, and the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop warned May’s plan would “harm our economy”.Directly ahead lies the European Union, whose big guns have yet to start firing but may well do if they conclude the White Paper would undermine the principles that hold the EU together.READ MORE: Brexit White Paper plans ‘will harm Scotland’s economy’            With some politicians viewing May’s Brexit as too soft and others too hard, opinion further divided by party affiliations, and Labour looking for any chance to bring down the Government, it is difficult to see how the Prime Minister can win a vote in the Commons.And, if the UK cannot agree its position, it appears there will be a “no-deal” Brexit in March next year with severe economic consequences for Britan and the real risk of disaster – companies relocating or going bust, mass job losses and social unrest. That must not happen. Perhaps May and her supporters will manage to make it through their own metaphorical Valley of Death, but if they do not, there needs to be a plan for what happens next.Earlier this week, Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for cross-party talks “with a view to establishing a government of national unity” and for a second referendum. If the UK is to avoid a no-deal Brexit, both suggestions – met with scorn in the Commons – may need to be seriously considered.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent.

The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

MSP","story":"Staff Reporter\nGUIDANCE on how to drive on single track roads and reminders to dispose of litter properly and respect the natural environment should be issued to all Airbnb guests staying in the Highlands, a leading MSP believes.\nKate Forbes said the move could be one of several measures to encourage responsible and sustainable tourism in popular rural areas in her constituency.\nWith tourism in the Highlands growing, more local people are embracing the economic and social opportunities of home-sharing through Airbnb, which enables hosts to generate extra income in areas with fewer employment opportunities.\nKate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, explained: \u0026ldquoAirbnb boast hundreds, if not thousands, of hosts across the Highlands as figures

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSaturday 14 Jul 2018 3:37

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nSaturday 14 Jul 2018 3:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27404  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe message must go loud and clear to London that the Backstop agreed in December is the bottom-line. - Mary Lou McDonald TD\nThe Brexit backstop agreed in December is the bottom line and must remain in place, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou has told the President of the EU Commission, Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe Sinn Féin President was speaking after the EU Commission President addressed a joint sitting of the Oireachtas in Leinster House today. \nAlongside the Sinn Féin TDs and Seanadóirí, Sinn Féin MPs and Martina Anderson MEP were also in the Oireachtas chamber for the speech. \nThe EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, was also in the gallery in the Dáil chamber for the speech. \nJean Claude Juncker told the joint sitting that \"Ireland will come first\" in the Brexit negotiations. \nHe also said dismissed the recent proposal from the British government for the backstop agreed in December to apply to Britain, saying it was  designed for the specific circumstances for the north of Ireland. \n\nThe EU Commission President also warned Britain that time is running out to come up with a deal. \"We need more answers and fewer questions,\" he said Oireachtas members and guests. \nMary Lou McDonald described Brexit as \"the biggest threat in a generation to our all-Ireland economy, our peace agreements and to the rights of our citizens\" and added that Ireland must not become collateral damage to the narrow agenda of right-wing British Tories. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said Theresa May and the British government have not put forward any credible proposals and said their approach \"remains littered with long-standing contradictions.\" \n\"The outworking of these unresolved contradictions in British policy is clear.

that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and
