The move, published on Monday, will see the new political wing become responsible for \u0027military-patriotic\u0027 work within the Russian ArmyThe defence ministry did not release details of the new directorate, but an unnamed military source told the Kommersant daily that Kartapolov would also be responsible for the activities of the Yunarmiya, a patriotic military youth organisation sponsored by the ministry.After Russia\u0027s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u0027s Crimea, seen by the Kremlin as a big success, the military has grown increasingly influential in domestic and foreign policy, especially in Syria.The Bolsheviks, wary of the army\u0027s loyalty, introduced political commissars in 1918. In the late Soviet period, political officers, known as \u0027zampolity\u0027, tried to ensure soldiers knew their communist doctrine and where their loyalties lay.

In the Soviet era, the directorate in practice worked in the interests of the Communist Party\u0027s central committee. \u0027It\u0027s not completely clear what military-political work the resurrected directorate will do and more importantly in the interests of which political party.\u0027Others wondered whether the creation of the new directorate was the start of a wider renaissance in ideological education that would draw in schools and colleges, and whether the new instrument would be used to root out young soldiers deemed as too pro-Western.\u0027All of this is reminiscent of a gradual return to the USSR,\u0027 wrote Dmitry Drize, Kommersant\u0027s deputy editor."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/09/4DF46A1500000578-0-image-a-6_1531126256163.jpg","title":"The modern family businesses run children","story":"    Family affair: Jordan Weller and his mother Julie prepare clothes for his online businesses which rakes in some £500-a-dayJordan, who lives at home with his parents in Essex, pays his mum a weekly wage of £80 to collect up to 50 items of vintage sportswear once or twice a week, which she\u0027ll wash and iron. She also prepares the quarterly report for the accountant.\u0027She takes the lead on all the things I don\u0027t have time to do\u0027, Jordan says. \u0027I could give her more work but it\u0027s difficult as the business is online and she\u0027s not very good on the computer.\u0027Start-up Doctor: How do I raise money and find investors to...Plumbers and handymen, Amazon needs you: New service for...How to find a better current account for your small businessCan coffee help homeless people off the streets?

He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.My seven-year-old sister helps model the clothes  While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers I\u0027m 24 and grandad\u0027s 81 and we are a business team Daniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.                            Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money                         \u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesMy mum helps out as a vintage bargain hunter  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.Natacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.                            There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn                         \u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart. But Natacha and I speak all the time.\u0027a.murray@dailymail.co.uk£150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/21/4EB3784000000578-0-image-a-1_1533069880283.jpg","title":"Why DID hide truth Manchester bomber","story":"    Salman Abedi was rescued from Libya by the Royal Navy before returning to the UKVictims of the Manchester Arena attack last night demanded to know why the Royal Navy\u0027s rescue of the bomber from war-torn Libya was kept secret.The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that HMS Enterprise plucked Salman Abedi, then 19, to safety as fighting intensified in August 2014.He flew home to the UK, but less than three years later set off a shrapnel-filled suicide bomb at a pop concert in the city where he grew up – killing 22 people, including seven children. An independent review of MI5 and counter-terrorism police\u0027s contact with Abedi was published in December.But the report by former terror watchdog David Anderson QC made no mention of the fact that Abedi and his brother, Hashem, 21, were among 100 British citizens evacuated by the Navy survey ship.Last night politicians, survivors and lawyers representing the families of those killed in the atrocity attacked the Government for keeping the public \u0027in the dark\u0027 about the rescue.          Salman Abedi, who attacked the Manchester arena was rescued from Libya onboard HMS Enterprise, pictured arriving in Valetta, Malta on August 4, 2014. Abedi was among 110 Britons - including his brother Hashem - rescued from the war zone by the Royal NavyThey also demanded to know why the Abedis – British-born sons of Libyan migrants – had been allowed to visit the Middle Eastern state without apparent scrutiny and subsequently fell off the security services\u0027 radar.Robby Potter, 48, who almost died in the attack after shrapnel from the bomb punctured his heart, told the Mail: \u0027The authorities have definitely hidden this information from us. They haven\u0027t been honest. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this article\u0027The Government should have told us straight away or it should have been in the reports. We have been left to find out through the Press.\u0027John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, said: \u0027It is deeply concerning that the Royal Navy\u0027s role in extracting Salman Abedi has had to be uncovered by a media investigation rather than being volunteered by the British Government.          Robby Potter, pictured with his wife Leonora Ogerio. They were both wounded in the attack\u0027In particular, David Anderson QC needs to explain why he did not include this in his report into the Manchester bombing – was he kept in the dark or did he choose to hide it from the public?\u0027Either way, this undermines the important role he had as Britain\u0027s independent reviewer of terror legislation.\u0027I believe the Navy acted perfectly properly in rescuing these British citizens but unnecessary secrecy leaves the unfortunate impression that the Government has something it wants to hide.\u0027 It is understood that the Ministry of Defence was the first Whitehall department to discover that Abedi had been rescued by the Royal Navy.          Abedi was already being monitored by the security services seven months before his rescueHis name emerged on passenger lists handed to the sailors on HMS Enterprise. The information was subsequently passed on to Number Ten, the Foreign Office and the Home Office.Whitehall sources said that Abedi\u0027s rescue did not come to light in the Anderson report because it had no relevance to potential security failings.But Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the bombing for the forthcoming inquests, said: \u0027The trouble with the Anderson report is that we are not allowed to see the primary sources – that is, the MI5 or other security service documents.\u0027I am sure that the security services have not told us the full story. We may need an inquiry to get at the truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Both Abedi and his brother ought to have been tracked better, there are certainly concerns around that.\u0027           The Daily Mail yesterday uncovered how Abedi was rescued by the Royal Navy from LibyaThe Anderson report revealed that Abedi was already being monitored by the security services a full seven months before the rescue and that MI5 closed his file as a result of mistaken identify a month prior to his evacuation from Libya in 2014.Senior security sources insist Abedi had not been radicalised at the time of the rescue and instead was brainwashed after watching bomb-making videos on the internet.However, other sources have claimed that Abedi was seen on the front line, fighting alongside jihadis in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya. Survivors of the atrocity said it was difficult to understand why the Abedis were not detained or monitored following the rescue on their return to the UK.Mr Potter, who was blown up while waiting for his daughter after the concert, said: \u0027The security services must have known the Abedis had gone to Libya to fight. They\u0027ve got questions to answer about why they let them back in the UK as free men.\u0027The security services should have questioned the Abedis about what they were doing in Libya, at the very least. They should have been taken back to Libya and not allowed into Britain.\u0027             Hashem Abedi, 21, brother of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi has claimed he is afraid to be extradited to the UK to face terrorism charges The UK government requested his extradition last October from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. But the high-level negotiations appear to have stalled.And in May Libyan judicial sources told the Mail that Hashem could escape justice by refusing to face trial in the UK. His opposition to being extradited might hold weight because he has joint Libyan citizenship, a source said.Mr Salem suggested however that Hashem, who was born in Manchester to Libyan migrants, might not be able to veto any attempt to bring him to Britain. \u0027He was afraid and he didn\u0027t want the Libyan Government to hand him over to Britain,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was very scared and the matter was still very hot but the decision is not in his hands. To me it\u0027s obvious he has committed a crime in Britain – of course he wouldn\u0027t want to be handed to them.\u0027Hashem is believed to have played a key role in the attack in May last year, including helping to buy materials for the homemade bomb set off by his brother Salman.He has also been linked to a plot to kill Peter Millett, the UK\u0027s former envoy to Libya.

Mr Salem said: \u0027This case is quite difficult, it is not going to be that easy for Hashem to be handed over. He is a Libyan citizen and yes although he is a British national as well, it is considered that he has also committed a crime here in Libya.\u0027Mr Salem said the decision over Hashem\u0027s future was for the Libyan government to decide and not his militia: \u0027The decision to hand him over is not in our hands.\u0027But he said his Special Deterrence Force unit would willingly release Hashem from its jail, which is holding around 250 Islamic State suspects, should they be asked to do so. He said: \u0027We cannot say no. What concerns us is that we want to reassure the British people.\u0027I understand so many innocent lives were lost, and the British people feel they we are not giving them the justice they are seeking because they presume that because he is a Libyan citizen and currently in Libya that we are providing him a safe haven.            Salman Abedi, pictured, murdered 22 people during a terrorism attack on the Manchester Arena \u0027On the contrary. We do want him to face justice.\u0027Our main concern is that he does face justice no matter if it is in Libya or Britain.\u0027Of Hashem\u0027s brother, he added: \u0027It is unfortunate that they had accommodated Salman for several years in their country and he has the British passport and he committed such a thing to a country that sheltered him and served him and that he would blow himself up and that he would kill innocent children.\u0027Even his own family were shocked. We met with them and have spoken to them.\u0027Mr Salem said there was enough evidence to convict Hashem, and he had \u0027confessed to everything\u0027.He added: \u0027He is facing two things. Either he is going to be tried in Libya or he is going to be tried in Britain. If the British government and the Libyan government reach an agreement for handing him over he will be then tried in Britain.\u0027He denied any suggestion that Hashem could have been tortured into confessing his role in the Manchester attack. And he said the suspect did not get his warped ideology from Libya: \u0027He was watching a lot of the videos on YouTube, watching videos of children in Iraq and Syria.\u0027The SDF has been tasked by the Tripoli government with hunting down Islamic State fighters."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/01/3D57D99800000578-0-image-a-39_1533082092682.jpg","title":"MAC MPs saying firms bury nuclear waste national parks","story":"    \u0027Go on.

Venezuela\u0027s crude oil sales account for some 96 percent of the country\u0027s revenue.Industry is operating at just 30 percent, perhaps best reflected by the farming sector which supplies barely a quarter of national consumption having provided 75 percent a few years ago, the National Farmers Federation said. In San Juan, Florimar Nieves, a 39-year-old primary school teacher said of life in the city: \u0027They send (running) water once a month. The rest of the time we have to buy it.\u0027There have been times where we\u0027ve had no electricity for 24 hours.\u0027 Nieves lives with her two daughters and a granddaughter on the outskirts of San Juan, in a neighborhood of small, unfinished houses, dirt roads and skinny dogs.She spends a quarter of her income buying water while her medical student daughter has to go to a neighbor\u0027s house to use the internet.Yet protests in San Juan are as scarce as food, medicines and sanitary products.Many residents seem resigned to their fate. Some collect rain water, while others pray that frequent power cuts won\u0027t damage their electrical appliances.           Far from being a remote village outpost, San Juan has a population of 160,000 inhabitants and is just 90 miles southwest of the capital Caracas.

He vowed to quadruple oil production, which has dropped from a high of 3.2 million barrels a day 10 years ago to a 30-year low of 1.5 million in 2018, but predicted it would take two years to see \u0027the first symptoms\u0027 of \u0027economic prosperity.\u0027That won\u0027t cheer the residents of San Juan, though.Carolina Azuaje, a 17-year-old medical student, leaves home at 6:00 am to try to get on one of the free buses supplied by her university, but often has to wait hours to do so.\u0027You have to punch and kick your way onto the bus,\u0027 she said. \u0027Last week, I broke a finger.\u0027It\u0027s no exaggeration. When the bus arrives, she jostles with around 100 people to try to board. Many don\u0027t make it, but most just laugh.Nieves says there\u0027s no point complaining as it will only lead to greater hardship.

He’s also been found guilty of posessing a sword and making threats to kill on another occasion. After the trial, it emerged that Webster had been scarred with acid, and had a large burn on the side of his head.His victim had already lost a daughter in a car accident, so the family are dealing with a double tragedy.  Xeneral Webster (left) showed no remorse as he was jailed for killing Joanne Rand (right) from High Wycombe. Her daughter Katie Pitwell faced him in court today            A disturbing photo on social media appears to show the teenagers posing behind a cowering woman who had been covered in flour and eggs as she sat on a park benchI want to know what turned Mr Webster into a person with no sense of proportion, that thought it was perfectly acceptable to settle a row in a busy shopping street with a bottle of acid?What happened to talking a problem out? What kind of background does he come from? Surely his mother must be devastated?Last week, in another British middle class town centre, a different kind of attack took place- involving four teenagers aged 17 and 15. Historic Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk is situated in beautiful countryside.In a local park, a gang of youths chucked flour and eggs over a vulnerable woman and posted the pictures of themselves gloating around their ‘trophy’ on social media, including Facebook.Understandably, outrage ensued, and the father of one of the boys immediately took him to the local police station.The mother of another seemed more concerned with the threats her family subsequently received and the fact that the outcry might ruin her son’s 16th birthday!The police said that the woman was left ‘severely distressed but not physically injured’ – wrong response. The poor victim was ritually humiliated and her life will be changed.  The bench in Bury St Edmunds where the vulnerable woman was attacked remained covered in flour after the incidentThe police response was feeble in the extreme. This isn’t a case of ‘boys will be boys’ or ‘larking about’- picking on someone with special needs is disgusting, full stop, and shows a total lack of empathy.What does that tell us about the rules laid down when they grew up? When does ‘having a laugh’ cross into ‘criminal behaviour’?The four boys have been arrested, but will they face custodial sentences or any punishment that might make them learn the true consequences of their actions?The local councillor has said that a small group of people cause trouble all the time on this estate- but shouldn’t parents as well as their kids be prosecuted?The third event which demonstrates that many young men today have no idea of acceptable behaviour concerns an altercation outside a trendy nightclub in Essex in the small hours of the morning.We all know young people get lippy after a few drinks, people push and shove in a queue, but what 20 year old Liam Holmes did to a young woman beggars belief.Put simply, he punched her hard in the face, and then- HE DID IT AGAIN! Shocking footage of his victim lying on the ground was posted on social media.Now, his mother has taken him to the police station, where is is being treated as a case of GBH- but mum loyally insists there\u0027s more to the incident than meets the eye. My question is- how can there ever be an excuse for knocking a woman unconscious?  Liam Holmes, 20, (left on the night in question) carried out the attack outside Faces nightclubs in Gants Hill, east London , MailOnline can revealAll these mothers and fathers (if there are any around) should be held accountable for their children\u0027s lack of empathy and anti-social behaviour.My parents and I did not see eye to eye. We argued constantly, especially when I reached my teenage years. I lied, stayed out late, started sleeping with boys and drinking (only in moderation) when I was 16.But I did have a strong sense of what was right and what was wrong. I grew up in a home with strict rules (maybe too many) about politeness, showing respect, and knowing my place.I might have railed against them, but they did provide a starting point for my journey in life. My mother worked long hours too, and wasn’t there when I came home from school.I knew it was wrong to threaten other people who were defenceless, to bully other kids (even though I was bullied and taunted for being thin and having big teeth and glasses). I got stronger as a result.The police tour schools and talk about crime and punishment and the consequences of bad behaviour- but maybe these talks should involve parents and be compulsory. In the end, parents have to take some of the blame for the moral vacuum that seems to be present in so many households. These boys deserve a proper start in life, not one that kicks off with a jail sentence.

He has no documentary evidence of the work or its existence.\u0027           Sketches of animals which Mr Davies drew during his spare time when he was youngerWolverhampton Wanders FC has been bought by numerous different owners between 1979 and now, and they were unaware of a potential copyright claim hanging over the club.Mr Wyand added: \u0027In the circumstances, it would be unconscionable for Mr Davies to be allowed to continue with his claim.\u0027The QC also asked the judge to order Mr Davies to pay the club\u0027s legal costs for investigating the matter and defending the case.However the judge has been asked by Mr Davies\u0027s lawyers to refuse the strike out application and allow the evidence to be tested at a full trial.    He added that, if he were hit with a big legal costs bill, Mr Davies could face bankruptcy.The hearing in London continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/17/4EBF184D00000578-6015749-image-a-31_1533140830035.jpg","title":"Night Wolves set base Europe Alarm biker gang linked Putin","story":"    New neighbours: The Night Wolves Russian biker gang, led by Alexander \u0027The Surgeon\u0027 Zaldostanov, have taken over a former pig farm 44 miles from the Slovak capital Bratislava          Friends of the leader: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and Alexander \u0027The Surgeon\u0027 Zaldostanov  ride motorcycles together in 2011          Putin fans: A member of the Night Wolves is seen inside the gang\u0027s base in Luhansk, UkraineAfter officially opening their Slovak branch in June the Night Wolves have held military-style exercises with the Slovak Recruits, a 200-strong nationalist paramilitary group, on the compound.\u0027They are no harmless motorcycle lovers,\u0027 President Kiska said in a statement according to Radio Free Europe.Dead Russian reporters researched mercenaries, mining in CARPutin creates a new political wing inside the Russian army...Share this article    New home: The Russian bikers opened a Slovak branch in June and held military-style exercises in the same month with the Slovak Recruits, a 200-strong paramilitary group          The Night Wolves have been under U.S. sanctions since 2014 for their role in the pro-Russian insurgency in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea          Coming soon: A sign on the side of the building appears to announce that the museum will open in SeptemberThe Russian bikers sat they intend to turn it into a museum honouring Soviet WWII units, and signs on the building claims it will open in September.While generally regarded as a satellite state of the USSR, Slovakia - then part of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was never officially part of the Soviet Union. \u0027In Slovakia they pay homage to the heroes who liberated the world from fascism, so the creation of the museum complex, dedicated to the events of World War Two, is logical, legitimate and desirable,\u0027 Zaldostanov said in a statement seen by the BBC.  Jozef Hambalek, founder of the Slovak branch of the Night Wolves, said denied any political motivation behind his creation of the Slovak chapter of Russia\u0027s Night Wolves. \u0027I am only interested in motorcycles and military history,\u0027 he said.

Manafort practiced law with Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease in Washington DC between 1977 and 1980.As reported in Vox, Paul Manafort is somewhat of a legend within Republican circles and his career can be split into three phases. He first garnered recognition within the party after working for Ford’s 1976 and Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaigns and, after the latter President’s success, he cashed in and started a consultancy business with the infamous Roger Stone.The firm became renowned for representing controversial types such as President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Angola’s guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, but occasionally dipped his toes into politics now and again, for example, to manage the 1996 Republican convention.In 2004, Manafort began to advise oligarchs in the former Soviet Union and soon focused on Ukraine, landing a contract to advise the country’s pro-Russian party. He worked to ensure that the Party of Regions leader Viktor Yanukovych returned to power he was elected President in 2010.However, demonstrators forced Yanukovych out and Manafort was involved in a lawsuit with President of Rusal Oleg Deripaska after the latter accused him of cheating him out of millions. At this point, Manafort had lost his income of millions and the FBI were investigating money he had earned from Ukraine.After being recommended by Roger Stone and the real estate investor Tom Barrack, Trump hired Manafort in March 2016 to lead his presidential campaign and in two months, was named campaign chair and chief strategist.However, polls were not looking good in August of the same year and amid reports that his Ukrainian payments were not legitimate, Manafort was out and Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon were in. Following this, he came under fire in Robert Mueller’s investigation which led to his indictment.          Paul Manafort stands with Donald and Ivanka Trump at the Republican National ConventionManafort\u0027s wifePaul Manafort has been married to Kathleen Bond Manafort since August 12, 1978 and she is a lawyer who has stayed out of the media, although it was widely reported that when FBI agents conducted a raid of their Alexandria, Virginia house in July 2017, they were in bed together.Since then, she has been a major part of the investigation, as Business Insider reported, because Kathleen has had a hand in a number of the couple’s major purchases. The Manaforts have bought numerous properties in Florida, Virginia and New York, in addition to a Trump Tower apartment in 2006 and a horse farm, which was sold in 2004.Properties that were initially purchased in Kathleen’s name have cropped up in the indictment, but beyond records about homes that they bought together, not much is known about the relationship between Kathleen and Paul Manafort.However, The National Enquirer, owned by American Media CEO David Pecker, a friend of Trump’s, has reported that Manafort had an affair with a much younger woman. Text messages between their daughters Andrea and Jessica also suggested that the marriage was breaking down.Manafort net worthThe former Trump campaign manager claimed that he was worth $28 million in November 2017, but many have had their doubts about this figure, especially because of his Trump Tower apartment, as reported in Bloomberg.A federal court filing read: ‘Although Manafort has provided the government with a spreadsheet listing his total assets at approximately $28 million, the government has yet to substantiate Manafort’s net worth.‘To ensure that any bail package is based on an accurate picture of his finances, we submit that Manafort should be required to represent the full extent of his assets, in the United States and abroad, to the court.’           Paul Manafort arrives with his wife Kathleen Manafort at the Albert V. Bryan U.S. CourthousePaul Manafort chargesPaul Manafort has been charged for what Mueller refers to as ‘the tax scheme’ and the Ukrainian money that allowed the former consultant to maintain his glamorous lifestyle. Mueller also claimed that Manafort had set up offshore shell companies and then spent $30 million of offshore cash in the US from 2008 to 2014.$12 million was spent on ‘personal items’ for the Manaforts which was spread over 200 transactions and included $5.4 million to a home improvement company in the Hamptons, $1.3 million to an antique rug store in Virginia, $849,000 to a men’s clothing store in New York, $819,000 on landscaping, and for several Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.Another $6.4 million was wired from offshore for a $1.5 million New York City condo, a $3 million Brooklyn brownstone and a $1.9 million Virginia house. It is also alleged that Manafort sent another $13 million to companies that the controlled, which the government claimed was to reduce his taxable income.For this, Manafort was charged with five counts of false income tax return and four counts for failure to report foreign bank or financial assets. The second set of charges are what Mueller has referred to as ‘the financial institution scheme’.These accusations are related to incidents when Manafort allegedly made a series of fraudulent declarations to banks to obtain mortgage loans after Yanukovych was deposed and his income stopped coming in.Manafort trial start datePaul Manafort’s trial started on Tuesday, July 31 2018 and is expected to last about two to three weeks. Mueller will likely call up to 35 people to testify, with the top witness being Rick Gates, Manafort’s right-hand man who worked with him in Ukraine and in the Trump campaign.Tad Devine is also another big name on the list and he is known for advising Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign, but also worked with Manafort in Ukraine. It is not known how Manafort and his lawyers will argue the case.Judge T.S. Ellis, however, has said that because of ‘the apparent weight of the evidence against him’, Manafort ‘faces the very real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.’          Paul Manafort talks to reporters at the Republican National Convention with Rick Gates behindWhy are there two Paul Manafort trials?Manafort is currently facing two federal trials: one which will be in the Eastern District of Virginia and has already begun, and the other in the District of Columbia, expected to begin on September 17. Mueller originally indicted Manafort in October 2017, but for reasons which are still unknown, he was not prepared to bring the tax and bank fraud charges against Manafort at the time.By February 2018, Mueller was ready to file the charges, but because law required some of the counts to be charged where Manafort lived — in Alexandria, Virginia — unless Manafort gave Mueller permission to charge him in DC, Manafort was given a choice.While it is cheaper for the defendant to prepare one trial rather than two, going through with the two separate trials would give the prosecution two separate opportunities to convict him. In addition to this, because DC is more liberal than Virginia, Manafort would have more of a chance of acquittal in the Eastern District. Although Manafort did not give Mueller permission to file the newer charges in DC, he miscalculated and the charges that were filed later, in the district known as the \u0027rocket docket\u0027, were brought to trial first.  Barbara McQuade, Professor from Practice at the University of Michigan Law School, also explained to Slate why he will face two different trials.‘Prosecutors sought to bring all of the charges in one venue, but Manafort declined to waive venue, which is his legal right,’ she explained.National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 1st AugustFacebook added a plane emoji reaction and people are confusedLyme disease: What is it?

One woman says he accused her of incompetence because she was \u0027not a mother\u0027Ms McCullough spoke of one alleged episode when she joined the MP on a trip to Russia and Ukraine in 2008 and found they were taken to an \u0027opulent\u0027 dinner thrown in his honour.It is unclear who paid for the meal, she claimed, and the dining experience fell outside of the itinerary, which had to be signed off before they left.Rules of the commons state that hospitality has to be arranged by the committee or appropriately declared.The former clerk also accused Mr Vaz of making jokes about her Northern Irish background, claiming she was a security threat.She alleged he launched a \u0027tirade\u0027 at her in a hotel lobby when she raised her concerns on the trip, explaining to her manager in an email: \u0027He then demanded to know what age I was.\u0027He told me that I didn\u0027t know how the House worked and that I didn\u0027t respect the authority of members, his authority in particular as a senior member of many years experience and chairman of the Committee, that I had an attitude problem.\u0027She further told Newsnight: \u0027He told me that I wasn\u0027t capable of serving the committee because I wasn\u0027t a mother...\u0027All I knew was it wasn\u0027t normal to be harangued about my fertility status in the reception of a hotel room, at public expense in front of my colleague on the team.\u0027He subsequently sought to undermine her position, she claimed.Representatives for Mr Vaz told the programme he denied berating Ms McCullough and did not \u0027at any time insult her maternal status\u0027.

When I was on the home affairs committee I saw that he had friends in the police and friends in the law.\u0027He said that one of the principal clerks was a friend and by the time I was leaving the house he had a friend in the Speaker.

He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.My seven-year-old sister helps model the clothes  While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers I\u0027m 24 and grandad\u0027s 81 and we are a business team Daniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.                            Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money                         \u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesMy mum helps out as a vintage bargain hunter  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.Natacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.                            There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn                         \u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart. But Natacha and I speak all the time.\u0027a.murray@dailymail.co.uk£150 Expedia voucher to switch"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/15/4EBEB79300000578-6013945-Clash_Heavily_armed_soldiers_were_seen_beating_a_man_in_the_stre-a-76_1533134551126.jpg","title":"Zimbabwes President Mnangagwa set victory ruling ZANU PF party claims majority seats","story":"    A man has been shot dead in Zimbabwe after soldiers fired at crowds amid protests over alleged fraud in the country\u0027s election.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u0027s ruling ZANU-PF party has cruised to a large majority in Zimbabwe - in the first elections since Robert Mugabe was ousted from power. Mnangagwa, nicknamed \u0027The Crocodile\u0027 is pictured casting his vote          Witnesses say a man was killed after being shot in the stomach when the Zimbabwean army opened fire on protesters who had clashed with police          Protests in Zimbabwe\u0027s historic elections turned bloody on Wednesday as a man was shot dead during demonstrations over alleged vote fraud and President Emmerson Mnangagwa appealed for calm          The polls - the first since autocratic president Robert Mugabe was forced out by a brief military takeover in November - had offered Zimbabwe the chance of turning the page on a brutal chapter of its past.          The mood quickly descended into anger and chaos as supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition declared they had been cheated          Opposition supporters burnt tyres in the centre of Harare, blocking some streets and engaging in running battles with police who fired water cannon to disperse the protestors          Police gathered in the city centre as the demonstrations gathered pace. One protester, Colbert Mugwenhi said: \u0027We had no weapons. Why are the army here beating us? shooting us?

The rest of the time we have to buy it.\u0027There have been times where we\u0027ve had no electricity for 24 hours.\u0027 Nieves lives with her two daughters and a granddaughter on the outskirts of San Juan, in a neighborhood of small, unfinished houses, dirt roads and skinny dogs.She spends a quarter of her income buying water while her medical student daughter has to go to a neighbor\u0027s house to use the internet.Yet protests in San Juan are as scarce as food, medicines and sanitary products.Many residents seem resigned to their fate. Some collect rain water, while others pray that frequent power cuts won\u0027t damage their electrical appliances.           Far from being a remote village outpost, San Juan has a population of 160,000 inhabitants and is just 90 miles southwest of the capital Caracas.

He vowed to quadruple oil production, which has dropped from a high of 3.2 million barrels a day 10 years ago to a 30-year low of 1.5 million in 2018, but predicted it would take two years to see \u0027the first symptoms\u0027 of \u0027economic prosperity.\u0027That won\u0027t cheer the residents of San Juan, though.Carolina Azuaje, a 17-year-old medical student, leaves home at 6:00 am to try to get on one of the free buses supplied by her university, but often has to wait hours to do so.\u0027You have to punch and kick your way onto the bus,\u0027 she said. \u0027Last week, I broke a finger.\u0027It\u0027s no exaggeration. When the bus arrives, she jostles with around 100 people to try to board. Many don\u0027t make it, but most just laugh.Nieves says there\u0027s no point complaining as it will only lead to greater hardship.

I wanted them to be intimidated. It was a slap in the face to the entertainment of the day’The first time I saw Grace was at a show at Les Mouches, a gay bar in New York, in 1974 or 1975. I already knew of Grace as a model, but I didn’t know she had a voice. I was agreeably surprised. Her aesthetic, however, wasn’t a surprise. It was typical of the 70s. I thought, “She’d be great if someone like Helmut Newton or Guy Bourdin did the staging of her shows.” I didn’t even think of myself.Later on, we got together. And for a while I was her accomplice, doing disco shows that I thought were tacky. But I’m a gentleman, so I didn’t say much, until the day she started copying me. I wanted to focus on Grace’s masculinity – to use what other people thought an embarrassment, and turn it around to her advantage. I wanted to create – with her, of course – a new character. It went beyond just a haircut, it was an attitude. It was new and strong and ambiguous. You didn’t know if it was a man trying to be a girl or a girl trying to be a man. It was a revolution. I remember the A\u0026ampR guys at Island saying, “Are you fucking crazy? This is never going to work.” And of course it did.The look went with the music. Around this time, Chris Blackwell signed Grace to Island Records, and her music took a new-wave turn. He blew up one of these photographs really big, 10ft tall or something, and put it in the studio, so that Sly and Robbie, two musicians from Jamaica who were not big fans of hers at the time, but were playing on her new record, would understand what the whole thing was about. Initially I wanted black on black in black – the background, the outfit, and Grace – with just that touch of white in the cigarette. I then changed the background colour to beige. I gave Grace’s lips a shade of dark brown or prune and dusted her cheekbones and torso with blue pigment to bring out the volume. The cigarette was all about colour and composition. I subsequently used it in other images, too, on her eye and below her nose. Of course, it also suggests something rebellious.People thought she looked outrageous, alien even. But it wasn’t just for show. I wanted this character to have great dignity. I wanted it to be a slap in the face to all the entertainment of the day, the Diana Rosses and other stars, all made up like stolen cars, with windswept hair. This was pure rigour, a girl being perfectly serious.I wanted the audience to be intimidated by this person, who wasn’t doing things like anyone else – the show, the look, the way of speaking, the music ... it was all entirely new. And that’s what the One Man Show was about: it was Grace saying goodbye to disco and cheap decadence, and hello to a radiant future, with me! It had a lot to do with a love story, really. In the end, enthusiasm is what makes you create. Most people since – young singers and big stars alike – have helped themselves to the GraceJean-Paul pool of ideas. They take stuff willy-nilly – the hairstyle, the look, the gestures, the mise-en-scene, the choreography. And it’s true that this character we created is much more spectacular than wearing big hats or designer outfits. It was completely original, a look that influenced fashion – that influenced the world.

Supplies of thousands of medicines could be disrupted if Britain leaves the EU without a deal next March and border checks and lengthy transport delays arise. The rival pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca and MSD (known as Merck \u0026amp Co in the US) have also announced stockpiling plans.Sanofi, a large producer of insulin and vaccines, is building up stocks of a wide range of medicines in British warehouses, creating a 14-week supply starting from April 2019. Most of its supplies arrive in the UK through the Channel tunnel it normally held just 10-week supplies of drugs in case of disruption, it said.Hugo Fry, the managing director of Sanofi’s UK operation, said: “The uncertainty in the Brexit negotiations means that Sanofi has been planning for a ‘no deal’ scenario. Patient safety is our main priority and we have made arrangements for additional warehouse capacity in order to stockpile our products, where global supply allows, in the UK, and increase UK-based resources to prepare for any changes to customs or regulatory processes.”He said this was in line with recommendations by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). “In the absence of any transition agreement, the European Medicines Agency will deem the UK to be a ‘third country’.” The threat of a no-deal with the EU over Brexit is also forcing drug makers to prepare for duplicate product testing and authorisation to ensure their products stay on the market.According to the EFPIA, about 45m patient-packs go to the EU from the UK every month and 37m patient-packs travel in the other direction. AstraZeneca, which makes the cholesterol pill Crestor, as well as the cutting-edge cancer treatments Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Lynparza, has begun parallel testing of drugs at its Swedish site in Gothenburg.The American pharmaceutical group MSD is also building up medicine supplies, with stocks lasting up to six months.Last week, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said NHS England was preparing to stockpile medicines and blood in case the UK left the EU without a deal. He told the health select committee he had met medical industry leaders to accelerate preparations.Sir Mike Rawlins, chair of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has warned that all insulin is imported to the UK and has to be temperature controlled.GlaxoSmithKline, Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company, which makes the asthma drug Advair, as well as HIV treatments and vaccines, said it always held additional supplies of medically critical drugs in case of disruption.GSK started implementing its contingency plans in January, focusing on supply chains. The drug maker estimated that Brexit-related costs would be up to £70m over the next two to three years, with ongoing costs of £50m a year, due to re-testing of medicines, transferring marketing authorisations in the UK to the EU, and altered manufacturing licences and other steps.A GSK spokesperson said: “Making sure that patients can access the medicines and vaccines they need is a priority for GSK, which is why we are continuing to implement our contingency plans to minimise the potential for disruption to supply of these products as a result of Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dd872ece5ff700dd9bb5703a08f10b8644daeb/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab8fc2ef58a0c62002f10acbbe19822","title":"germanys china city duisburg became xi jinping gateway europe","story":"For much of the 20th century, the city of Duisburg in Germany’s industrial west was a steel-and-coal town whose chimneys cloaked the skies in smoke. And yet there is something about this soot-stained spot in the Ruhr valley that seems to encourage a particularly clear-sighted view of the rest of the world.In 1585, it was in Duisburg that Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator published a book of maps of European countries – the first ever “atlas” to carry that name. And it was here that Mercator first presented his new world map, the “Mercator projection”, that was so revolutionary for maritime navigators keen to steer merchant vessels across the high seas in the straightest possible line.If in 2018 Duisburg is slowly rediscovering its cosmopolitan past, it is not just because four centuries after Mercator, traders are still trying to find the most direct route from A to B. As the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs and Brexit-related trade barriers is driving wedges between the EU and the Anglosphere, this former rust-belt town town allows one to see in real time how Germany and China are intensifying their economic ties.China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China – and Chinese goods – with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century silk road, made up of a belt of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime road of shipping lanes.Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects?In\u0026nbspCities of the New Silk Road\u0026nbspwe have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project\u0027s tangible results so far – from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed “Germany’s China city”. Our correspondents have reported from\u0026nbspthe “next Dubai” rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa’s largest port, and more.Nick Van MeadRead more: Cities of the New Silk RoadEvery week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg’s inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.In Duisburg’s port, where train tracks run straight to the edge of the Rhine River, goods are loaded straight on to ships, stored for further dispatch in one of several football pitch-sized storage units, or sent on by train or truck to Greece, Spain or Britain.Local politicians, while still proud of the city’s links to the 16th-century mapmaker, also like to compliment the perceptive eye of modern Chinese cartographers: in a map of Europe displayed at Shanghai airport, they point out, Duisburg’s name is printed larger than London, Paris or Berlin.“We are Germany’s China city,” says Sören Link, Duisburg’s Social Democrat mayor. For years, his city has been a symbol of the challenges of long-term structural changes facing industry in the Ruhr region: in 1987, photographs of thousands of Krupp steelworkers barricading a bridge over the Rhine protesting against imminent factory closures travelled around the world.The trains’ return journeys, however, remain Duisburg’s achilles heel. For every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China.And while the west’s appetite for gadgets made in China shows no sign of abating, one of the main European products heading east is powdered milk – a result of low trust in domestic brands following a 2008 food safety scandal. If that trust returns, even fewer containers may be heading east from Duisburg.“The ratio used to be 4:1, so it has improved, but we still have an imbalance,” admits Erich Staake, the port’s CEO. A former TV channel manager, he is not shy to take credit for the entrepreneurial spirit of the port. Since taking charge in 1998, employment at Duisport has soared from 19,000 to 50,000.While other German port cities such as Hamburg run their harbour “like a landlord”, Staake says, Duisburg has worked to court new trade, modernising its logistics infrastructure and even setting up its own railway company. He is building a new 20,000 sq metre storage unit where China Railways will be able to neatly stack 2,000 containers.Staake’s aspiration doesn’t stop there. For Duisburg to permanently establish itself on the New Silk Road, he says, rail travel between China and Europe needs to outstrip other freight methods.“Rail freight between Chongqing and Duisburg is almost twice as expensive as shipping, but takes 12 days instead of 45. Air freight is at least twice as expensive as rail freight, but takes on average five days. If we can reduce lead times even further, below 10 days on average, then that opens up a lot more potential.”But in Germany, some have been quick to sound a note of caution. If the still-recovering industries in western Germany make themselves too reliant on China, they warn, it could provide economic leverage for an authoritarian regime that wants to project its geopolitical power into western Europe. “What’s good for Duisburg isn’t necessarily good for the world,” cautioned one recent article.For now though, China’s soft power barely registers in the region. The number of Chinese citizens living in the city has doubled in the past eight years – but from a low base of 568. The local Duisburg-Essen University houses a Confucius Institute and attracts the largest number of Chinese students in Germany, most of whom study engineering and economic sciences. They support a growing network of relatively authentic Asian fast food joints which now compete with the kebab houses introduced by a previous generation of migrants.The reasons journey times from China are still far too long, as Staake sees it, lie mainly with the heavily unionised rail companies in Europe rather than their counterparts in Asia: trains take on average six days to travel the 1,300km (800 miles) from Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border to Duisburg, while the 10,000km from Chongqing to Belarus is often completed in five-and-a-half days. “The Chinese and the Kazakhs drive thousands of kilometres a day, they really work hard. It’s ridiculous, really. Of course we are trying to work out why this is happening. You know how many train drivers’ unions we have, and the Poles are not much better,” says Staake. At the Duisburg city museum, visitors can still listen to the chants and jeers of the workers who went on strike over the closure of the steelworks in the 1980s and early 90s. A button hidden inside a wall made of original Ruhr valley coal triggers a recording. The modern Duisburg port with all its modern marvel, however, has yet to find its place in the city’s memory. In the entrance hall to the museum, a wall greets visitors with the words for “welcome” in the languages of all the migrant workers who have shaped the city, from Kurdish to Greek to Polish. For now, the Mandarin or Cantonese phrases for “welcome” do not feature.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eef2f85edb18442eaeffae02d664f754f268612/0_273_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcca3936d9207c62dbe6642c163a2dc2","title":"no deal brexit mps","story":"We are not so great we can defy the catastrophic reality. Even MPs who would not save the country might opt to save themselvesBritain’s national conversation is subjecting voters to two dangerous falsehoods. The first, that a no-deal Brexit couldn’t harm us. The second, that it could ever happen.The first fallacy exposes the worst of Brexit’s toxicity: namely, the casual, unabashed exceptionalism that places the enterprising British beyond the laws of gravity. Brexiters protest that our “clean break” departure on WTO rules will ensure that life continues as normal. The only thing that will break in this scenario is Britain’s economy and social contract.A no-deal Brexit will tear us from every EU law, instrument and agency overnight. We have nothing with which to replace them. Out of the European Aviation Safety Agency, no British plane or pilot will be certified or insured. Out of the single market and customs union, every British lorry will have to be checked at French ports for tariffs and standards, bringing cross-Channel traffic to a standstill. These outcomes are not only legal, but required. The WTO cannot and will not help.The first falsehood has birthed the second. Persuade enough people that a no-deal won’t amount to an unequivocal national breakdown, and it follows that we may actually end up doing it with public and parliamentary support. But the plan won’t work. We are not leaving without a deal under any circumstances.First, the political reasons. Chief among them, Theresa May. She will not accept a no-deal scenario. Everything she has done so far demonstrates her terror of it. The EU has called her bluff on the negotiation sequencing, orce payment, Irish backstop and transition terms, and to keep the show on the road she has blinked each time.Assume then that May folds and subsequently resigns. The new prime minister declares that no deal really is better than a bad deal. He or she needn’t come clean about the consequences: reality will step into the breach. Put simply, Britain will start shutting up shop by the new year. Tens of thousands of EU citizens will leave, manufacturers will make show-stopping announcements about the closure of businesses, and the pound will tumble. Can the new prime minister depend on voters’ enthusiastic embrace of an entirely voluntary and pointless Blitz spirit, or will they call for a climbdown?Imagine the political crisis escalates. The prime minister faces down public pressure to change course and has to confront parliament. Which brings us to the other key block for no-deal: parliamentary arithmetic.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.Tory MPs have so far largely swallowed a hard Brexit they do not want. But a no-deal is an unprecedented catastrophe. Many shy rebels will draw the line at licensing national suicide on principle. Others will think more politically. A Tory government that sends the economy and livelihoods over the cliff will collapse the Tory party for a generation. Even MPs who would not save the country might opt to save themselves. Labour, for its part, declared a no-deal scenario its red line in the 2017 election manifesto. Even a handful of extra Tory rebels would break the government’s Brexit majority. After all, government whips last month threatened MPs that losing a key Brexit vote would trigger a general election, and still only won by six votes.Why then is May talking up the prospect of no-deal even when it remains inconceivable? This is the real “project fear”. She hopes that just enough talk of stockpiling food and medicine will blackmail just enough MPs into voting for her still-elusive EU deal. Far likelier is that she scares the public into supporting a new vote on Brexit, with the option of abandoning it altogether.The government and hard Brexiters are really engaging in niche games of cakeism. The government wants to scare us with talk of hardship without spelling out the full horror of no-deal. The Brexit fundamentalists prefer the more traditional Orwellian pursuit of promising no new border controls while simultaneously declaring we will take back control of our borders. The electorate will ultimately punish both sides for their duplicity.Both the no-deal fallacies originate in the biggest lie of all: that Britain’s putative greatness allows it to defy concrete reality. But in the first instance, we have built our interconnected economic life on the floor of EU agreements that a no-deal instantly cuts away. In the second, we lack the bargaining power, legal security or economic might to legitimise the threat either in Brussels or at home.Here then is the truth. National myth-making may feed our imaginations, but not our stomachs. We are, in reality, not so special. Any country will burn if you set fire to it. The prime minister may see fit to light the fuse, but so long as we live in a parliamentary democracy, MPs will have the power to confiscate the matches.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296700ee07fb9bfa503ac118805b74d16286c215/0_45_2530_1518/master/2530.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f7ef9e0da01933a40d9f7f493752426","title":"tv comedy monty python hannah gadsby","story":"If we are to believe John Cleese, who has lately morphed into the classic old man yelling at a cloud, the reason that Monty Python hasn’t been shown on the BBC for nigh-on 20 years is that it’s “too funny”. The only explanation, he told a simpering Nick Robinson on the Today programme, is that “it might not contrast well with some of the comedy they’re doing now”. He went on to cite the 90s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, once voted the funniest comedy of all time, as an example of forgettable programming. “Have you ever heard of it since?” he asked, witheringly.It is a common complaint among once brilliant entertainers to pine loudly for the supposed good old days when art was interesting and edgy, and to deem everything that came after them to be inferior. Barely a day goes by without a Gallagher brother bitterly badmouthing younger, more successful musicians see also Will Self declaring the novel “doomed”.There’s no denying the weight of Monty Python’s cultural contribution. My own mental picture of Cleese is still as the bowler-hatted civil servant with elasticated legs, half dancing, half goose-stepping down the street in the Ministry of Silly Walks, or as the expostulating customer in the Dead Parrot sketch holding said bird upside down and proclaiming it “an ex-parrot”. At their absolute peak, the Pythons were outrageously funny, the high benchmark of surrealist humour. But, on the rare occasion that I return to them now, my appreciation is different. Some of the sketches stand up others do not. They no longer make me hoot, and sometimes make me cringe. This is the way with comedy. It recalibrates and evolves. It’s what it’s meant to do.Cleese is right that Men Behaving Badly hasn’t aged well. But that’s not due to its inferiority so much as being product of a time when it was apparently hilarious for men to behave like lobotomised idiots owing to a newfangled concept called irony. Like it or loathe it, it was a direct response to the culture into which it was born.Today we have Nanette, the masterwork from Hannah Gadsby currently on Netflix, a brave, brilliant and righteous piece of standup that deconstructs comedy – confronting the sexism and homophobia Gadsby has faced – while operating within its most traditional format. Right now, it looks like a game-changer, but you can just picture Cleese in that audience, mouth like a cat’s bum, prattling on about political correctness – note his grumble on Today about not being allowed to say the word “poof” – and asking where the gags are.It hardly needs saying that contemporary TV comedy is in rude health– should you need pointers, let me refer you to Catastrophe, Derry Girls, Gameface, Fleabag and Mum – and that viewers are spoiled for choice. Cleese feeling slighted that Python is no longer aired on the BBC is obviously daft given that The Meaning of Life, The Life of Brian and all 45 episodes of Monty Python’s Flying Circus are available on Netflix. But it’s also\u0026nbsprather sad.Recently the BBC’s head of comedy, Shane Allen, caused ripples of umbrage when he remarked that, in a drive towards ersity, the white, Oxbridge-educated likes of Monty Python’s Cleese and Michael Palin probably wouldn’t get a look-in now. Cleese was predictably irate, but his entitlement regarding Python and its legacy makes Allen’s point for him.No comic, no matter how heavyweight, is entitled to be on television 45 years after their heyday. Cleese recently told Emily Maitlis on Newsnight that he is leaving the country. Who’d like to help him pack?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce92693860c9d361702132cfe8e8dde5c640d1a/199_120_3122_1873/master/3122.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvNTM4OGZjODViNTQ0N2E4M2NmMWNlMTg5YTVhMjE1NzMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=2cbc547d702cf0a406385e6c5015f3e7","title":"headline shows the seven greatest music venues in the us","story":"From Madison Square Garden out east to the west’s Hollywood Bowl, via New Orleans blues bars and secret Joshua Tree saloons, visit the most important musical addresses in the USConsidering its totemic role in the creation of virtually every form of popular music we listen to today – from hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and soul to house, hardcore punk and good, plain old classic rock – it should come as a surprise to no one that the US is home to a huge share of the world’s most storied music venues.Some of them are famous for their size, scale and setting, while others have entered the popular consciousness for their part in the history and development of certain styles of music. Some of them, too, are sadly no longer with us, such as New York’s CBGB, or may not count as music venues in the formal sense at all – the street corners of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Compton and suburban Atlanta that gave birth to hip-hop come to mind. Whatever your taste or level of music-nerdery may be, one thing is for sure: the seven venues below have all at some point provided the setting for significant moments in US cultural history.To New Yorkers, Madison Square Garden holds a singular place in the city’s imagination. Known to them simply as “the Garden”, this 20,000 capacity venue describes itself, modestly, as “the most famous arena in the world”. Ordinarily, such a claim would hardly be credible but, in the case of Madison Square Garden, it’s more than justified. Consider this: since the current arena opened its doors in 1968 – there had been three previous public venues occupying the same site since 1879 – the Garden has hosted a number of the greatest shows in the history of popular music, including George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 Parliament Funkadelic’s legendary sold-out shows of 1977 and 1978 and, more recently, LCD Soundsystem’s final (or, as it turned out, not so final) show in 2011, which was released the following year as the groundbreaking concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. It might also be worth mentioning that while the Garden doesn’t have an official house act, that bloke from across the Hudson who goes by the name of Bruce Springsteen has played the venue no less than 47 times. The most famous arena in the world? They’re probably right.If Madison Square Garden is the premier indoor concert venue in the US, then Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre would have to be its most spectacular outdoor musical locale. Framed by an enormous angled rock on one side, with stunning views of the rugged mountain terrain on the other, Red Rocks’ unparalleled outdoor setting has been used to a striking effect in concert films over the years, including U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky and Neil Young’s Red Rocks Live. With a capacity of almost 10,000, the otherworldly arena has also hosted legendary performances by REM, Stevie Nicks and, on what must have been a particularly psychedelic night in 1968, Jimi Hendrix and the Soft Machine. This year, its programme of events includes appearances by Jackson Browne, Seal and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as every rapper’s favourite rapper, that inimitable Brooklyn native, Nas.Instantly recognisable for its “shell” of concentric arches over the stage, the Hollywood Bowl is to Angelenos what Madison Square Garden is to New Yorkers. Set in the bowels of the Hollywood Hills – with the Hollywood sign perched not far off in the background – the list of notable pop and rock performances here is too exhaustive to detail, hosting over the years the Beatles, the Doors (both of whom recorded live albums at the site), Kraftwerk, Prince, Black Sabbath and Dolly Parton. But the 17,500 capacity venue isn’t just famous for its live shows this being Hollywood, it has also featured as a location in films as varied as Some Kind of Wonderful, Beaches and Escape From LA.Perhaps no other continuously operating venue in the US has such a mythical status for its role in the history and development of one style of music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. All of the greats (and by that we do mean all) recorded and performed here over the years: Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, Monk, Rollins, Evans, Brubeck, Baker … the list goes on. And for this reason, the Village Vanguard might just be the No 1 place of pilgrimage for jazz lovers in the world. But it is by no means for jazz buffs alone this intimate, 120-seat venue offers an authentic taste of an older New York – as a much a place to sit back with a good martini, take in the portraits of the legends that line the walls and imagine the curlicues of smoke that once rose from the tables and gave this tiny basement club the hazy ambience that jazz venues the world over have sought to replicate.If Nashville is the home of country music, then the closest thing it has to an exact address would be 2,804 Opryland Drive, where you’ll find Grand Ole Opry – a venue that holds roughly the same significance for lovers of country music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. But the Grand Ole Opry is a little bit more than a music venue: taking its name from the weekly concert radio performance, it is also the longest radio broadcast in US history, having first hit the airwaves in 1925, moving between Nashville locations before finally settling in its current, purpose-built venue in 1974. The great names of country and western, from Johnny Cash to Loretta Lynn, and Garth Brooks to Patsy Cline, have all been regulars at the Opry, and some 215 acts have held a coveted Opry membership (a sure sign that you’ve “made it” as a country star) at some point in their careers.Possibly the coolest venue in the US that you’ve never heard of, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s is a dusty saloon bar located in the depths of California’s cowboy country, on the fringe of Joshua Tree national park. The stature and notoriety of Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s has grown rapidly in recent years, since becoming the venue of choice for many an artist booked at the nearby Coachella festival to play a secret little show of their own on the side. Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritualized, Sonic Youth, Lorde and – pause – Paul McCartney have all passed through for a jam at some point. Oh, and it’s also home to a fully preserved cowboy and western film set out the back, complete with the facades of a local bank, chapel and saloon, which served as the location for dozens of films and television programmes in its 1950s heyday.No list of the US’s great music venues would be complete without at least one entry from New Orleans – and given that it is the home of the legendary Preservation Hall, competition was stiff. But we all know that they do things a little bit differently south of the Mason-Dixon line, and nowhere down south does that hold truer than in New Orleans, so it only seems fitting to choose Kermit’s Treme Mother-in-Law Lounge – one of the most magnificently eccentric music spots in the city. Set up by 60s R\u0026ampB legend and self-proclaimed “emperor of the universe” Ernie K-Doe, the lounge hosts local jazz, funk and legendarily swampy Louisiana blues performances week in, week out, and is as famous for the mind-bending murals that adorn its exterior walls as it is for its raucous shows and southern soul food.United Airlines flies from four UK airports to key US hubs, with onward connections to more than 280 destinations across the Americas.

Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope.

Add the speculation swirling around several members of Chelsea’s dressing-room, the drawn-out process of officially appointing him and his own predilection for information overload – at Sansovino, one of a number of humble lower-ision teams on his CV, he was nicknamed Mr 33 because that was the number of set-piece routines he expected his players to memorise – and Maurizio Sarri’s task appears particularly formidable.Fortunately he is not prone to overhyping his likely impact. Back in 2015, when he was first approached by Napoli, Sarri delivered an unusual sales pitch. “We’re going to lose our first seven games,” he told Aurelio De Laurentiis. “I laughed,” the club’s president later remembered. “He smiled. The understanding between us was born in that moment.” De Laurentiis might not have been laughing when they did indeed lose their first game, to Sassuolo, and followed that with a pair of unconvincing draws. He approached Sarri again, wondering if it might be worth moving away from the narrow 4-3-1-2 formation that had worked well for the coach in the past but seemed unsuited to Napoli’s squad. “President, let me do it my way,” Sarri replied. “We might lose the first seven games, but then you’ll see what happens.”Should anyone lose their first seven games at Chelsea it is fairly obvious what would happen, but happily Sarri’s subsequent success makes it seem extremely unlikely. In the end he did change his formation for Napoli’s next game, starting with a single striker and two wingers. They won 5-0, and then did it again in their next match. “The switch to 4-3-3,” De Laurentiis concluded, “happened because of me.”Sarri has stuck with 4-3-3 ever since, and from Chelsea’s pre-season friendlies appears determined to use it again at Stamford Bridge. Sarri’s tactics worked phenomenally in Naples last season: they might have narrowly lost out to Juventus in the race to the Serie A title but in Europe’s top five leagues only Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City averaged more shots per game than Napoli only City, Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain bettered them on possession, only City played more passes and only at City, Liverpool and Juve were goalkeepers forced into fewer saves. If Sarri can bring this style to Chelsea, the results could be genuinely thrilling.“I love this philosophy,” David Luiz admitted. “We play high, with lots of possession of the ball, in a technical way. He’s trying to help us every single day to learn quickly his philosophy, to do our best for Chelsea. A new philosophy always takes time, but it also depends on us. If we are dedicated every day in training we can try to learn quickly. It depends also on us.”The arrival of Sarriball, as Napoli’s technical, high-speed style of play was christened, will be widely celebrated. Importantly, it is not only intended to be successful, but to be joyful. “My goal is to have fun as long as I am here and be competitive in all competitions,” he said. “Ours is not a sport, but a game, and anybody who plays a game starts doing that when they are young because it is fun. The child in us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best.”This prioritisation of pleasure comes in complete contrast to Chelsea’s last couple of managers. The difference between the miserable demeanour exhibited by his predecessor-but-one, José Mourinho, this pre-season and the man who now sits in the Chelsea dug-out is jarring. It is hard to imagine the Portuguese asserting, as Sarri does, that the most important thing in life is “to have fun while you do your job”.But the Italian’s arrival will not be celebrated by everyone at Chelsea, and the tactical overhaul will inevitably have casualties. Perhaps the great beneficiary of Antonio Conte’s switch to a 3-5-2 formation was Victor Moses, who sprung from relative obscurity to indispensability almost overnight. He appears likely to make the same journey in reverse now, while César Azpilicueta returns to right-back. Meanwhile Chelsea have been repeatedly linked with centre-backs, most frequently Daniele Rugani, which appears bizarre given their wild surfeit of options in that position, the fact that this year they will play with only two, and Sarri’s insistence that the transfer market is “a refuge for weak coaches” and that he will instead focus on “growing the players we have”.“He is bringing a different style, a different formation and we just need to grow into it,” Cesc Fàbregas said. “We need time to re-adapt to a back four and to what the boss wants but I believe we’re intelligent players and players at the top level who will try to adapt as soon as possible.”Fàbregas’s own place in the team is at considerable risk. Of the central midfield three Jorginho, Sarri’s trusted fulcrum who has followed the manager from Naples, is certain to start, while N’Golo Kanté is surely indispensable. This leaves room for one attacking midfielder with Fàbregas, Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek of the current squad competing for the place. Meanwhile Tiémoué Bakayoko, who exhibited none of the technical excellence that Sarri’s system demands last season, seems no more likely to excel, or even appear, this year.With just days remaining before the season starts it is impossible to predict with any certainty the identity of their first-choice goalkeeper or any of Sarri’s chosen front three. Álvaro Morata has been typically inconsistent in pre-season – Sarri’s observation that he “did not play very well” against Perth Glory was refreshingly honest but not very encouraging. Meanwhile any or all of Eden Hazard, who would surely fit the Italian’s system beautifully, Willian and, at the other end, Thibaut Courtois might have left the club before the big kick-off.One side-effect of the absence of many first-team players from much of pre-season has been that Sarri has been forced to play youth-team graduates in their place. The winger Callum Hudson-Odoi and defender Ethan Ampadu, both just 17, have stood out, while Chelsea also have Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham returning from loan spells at top-flight clubs. Sarri’s priorities, in order, may be the pursuit of pleasure and of glory but, having spoken so enthusiastically of player development, if he fails to create a route into the first-team squad for the shining lights of a remarkable generation of youngsters then all hope that anyone will ever do so, already dimmed by years of failure, might be lost for good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44f09051fa6495fcdc09a01101515f5913ad6e4/0_0_6475_3885/master/6475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a228810f5096a6301f5101c73ef9aa0","title":"can you learn to cook like a chef by watching youtube","story":"Chef Lallalin Mahasrabphaisal cooks in one of Manchester’s most acclaimed restaurants, Siam Smiles.

It is full of guitar lessons, car-repair tips and makeup tutorials.I am a quasi-competent, if unadventurous cook. Could I teach myself to cook like a chef, using YouTube alone? I decide to spend a week trying. If nothing else, I’ll get to watch a lot of videos.For my first attempt, I need something straightforward. I have spent the entire day looking at tutorials, and it is now too late to produce a failed meal before dinner. Whatever I make will have to be dinner.I choose pappardelle with prosciutto and mushrooms, as demonstrated by Claire Saffitz of Bon Appetit magazine. More than 800,000 people have watched the video, which seems like a ringing endorsement. While the dish requires no particular skill, it is still a bit precious. The point at which honest cooking tips over into fussy cheffery is probably different for everyone, but for me it starts as soon as a recipe calls for shallots instead of onions. I don’t have shallots.Fortunately, they are not hard to source, although pappardelle is: I have to go to three places to find some.The recipe is particular with regard to order: prosciutto is crisped and removed. In go the mushrooms, followed by shallots, thyme, pepper, salt and stock. Saffitz, who has the advantage of having all her ingredients chopped and pre-measured in little bowls, talks quickly. The total cooking time is said to be 20 minutes, but the video is only four minutes long. I watch while I cook, pausing every few seconds.It works, though – as long as you do exactly as she does, you can’t go far wrong. My version looks very much like the one in the video, even if it took me a lot longer than 20 minutes.“It’s good,” my wife says. “I would eat this again.”“That’s unlikely,” I say.While I am trawling through videos of people messing about with strands of melted sugar, a thumbnail of a raspberry tart catches my eye. How hard can it be?Unfortunately, the video is only about making the filling – creme patissiere or, as they say in the US, pastry cream. A common feature of YouTube cooking videos is their specificity: they often tackle a single technique, rather than a whole dish. You have to cobble together your own recipe from a number of separate tutorials.The sweet shortcrust pastry I’m using comes from a Jamie Oliver video – it is typically laid back, to the extent that his young son wanders in halfway through and becomes part of the demo. On one level I find this charming, but I also think: ‘Hey kid, we’re in the middle of something here – do you mind?’ I put my pastry dough in the fridge to rest, and move on to a new video.The next link in the chain is called “The ultimate how to blind bake pastry case crust from a Bake Off finalist” – by Luis Troyano from the Great British Bake Off’s fifth series – and it is characterised by a wholly counterintuitive perfectionism. He leaves the excess pastry hanging over the sides of the tin until the case is cooked. He uses dried beans in clingfilm to weigh down the bottom. And the case comes out of the oven twice for fiddly adjustments. But the results are impressive. Mine looks like I bought it from a shop.From there, I move on to “Make No-Fuss Pastry Cream” with Thomas Joseph. There’s actually quite a bit of fuss, and in the blur of instruction, I measure out only half the amount of milk required. He doesn’t actually specify the quantity of butter, which doesn’t matter because I forget to put any in. On the upside, I have invented a new, very strong kind of glue. On the downside, I have to go out and buy more of everything and start again. It is dark outside by the time I find myself sizing raspberries for the top. When it is finished, I am too tired to eat it.“What’s for supper?” my wife says. I open the fridge and stare inside.“Duck breast scallopini with bacon-infused lentils and dates?” I say.“Dates?” she says. “Ugh.”“Don’t worry,” I say. “I forgot to buy the dates.”Actually, it’s a relief to break with the rigidity of a tutorial by leaving something out. I’m worried the oversight will lead to unforeseen disaster, but the dish turns out fine, and more importantly, it looks right. You can’t tell from the photo that it hasn’t got dates in.I have been noticing these cakes with elaborate, lacy fretwork sides made from chocolate. At first, I was just curious to see how it was done. After watching a few tutorials, however, I dared to dream of replicating it. But I wake to the warmest day of the year, possibly the century. I can’t stand the heat in my kitchen, and I haven’t turned on the oven yet.I can manage a passable victoria sponge, but my cakes never come out looking like the ones on Bake Off. I discover a tutorial showing how to bake a cake with straight cylindrical sides and a perfectly flat top. It turns out there’s something called a cake strip – a fabric cake tin jacket that you soak in water before baking – that prevents the edges of the cake from cooking faster than the middle. A video from the Preppy Kitchen demonstrates how to make your own from foil and wet kitchen roll. I’m really not expecting this innovation to have any effect, but it does. My cake is flat.After consulting several more videos, I ice it as smoothly as I can.Finally, I cue up a tutorial by Julia Usher – a pastry chef with a background in mechanical engineering. Her tone – jolly, assured, a little brusque – implies a considerable competence gap: if your cake doesn’t turn out like hers, it is only because she is amazing at this sort of thing.The idea is to pipe a complex latticework of melted chocolate on to greaseproof paper, and then to wrap the whole thing round the cake once it has firmed up. Step one is to measure the diameter of the cake, and multiply it by pi to get the circumference. I’m horrified to learn I have 63cm of side to produce. I painstakingly copy Usher’s design on to the paper and tape it to the table.I follow as best I can, but Usher’s piping skills soon outstrip mine. Her parallel lines are perfect. “I’m just eyeballing these,” she says. Yeah, me too, I say. Halfway through, I convince myself I prefer my freeform pattern.In hot weather, chocolate more or less melts, but it doesn’t harden in a hurry. My design is so long I have to cut it in half to get it in the fridge. Still it won’t set. Usher has nothing to say about any of this. She has moved on.I transfer the lattice to the freezer, catching it on the edge of the door and smearing one corner. Within five minutes, the chocolate is too brittle to bend around the cake. I hold the whole thing over a gas ring until it sags in the middle. I tell myself I’m improvising, but really, I’m panicking. I slap the lattice round the cake, shove the cake in the fridge and pour myself a drink. The clock says it’s 10pm. I’ve been at this since lunchtime.About 40 minutes later, I take out the cake and gingerly pull at the paper. It comes away easily, while the design – not all of it, but most of it – stays on the cake. In the circumstances, it seems like a miracle. And I still have enough chocolate in the bag to pipe some kind of sentiment on top. I choose “The End Is Nigh”. Because it is.We have people coming over for dinner, and I am out of ideas. I chase one video tutorial with another, settling on nothing. Eventually I give up and head to the market, where I buy some bream and some prawns. I have no idea what to do with them, but I figure there will be plenty of videos. Back home, I watch several about peeling and deveining prawns, hoping for a faster way. It turns out doing it faster is more or less a matter of being better at it.For the bream, I watch half a dozen tutorials and improvise a blend of them all – keeping techniques they have in common, discarding anything difficult or weird. I end up stuffing the fish with herbs pounded in a pestle and then barbecuing them, five minutes a side – no big deal. One of my guests pronounces the meal a triumph, on condition of anonymity.“Do you want some cake?” I say. “I have loads of cake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6eda0141a0ab40a2dfd713cc341e0c3848efca3/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=807db0d3e5bcade5b59018f77b1924f7","title":"iron maiden review metro radio arena newcastle legacy of the beast tour","story":" Radio Arena, NewcastleThe heavy metal heroes stage their most extravagant show to date, an anti-war opera full of pyrotechnics, swordfights and monastic chantingThere is a point to all this. The usually crowd-bantering Dickinson announces that he’ll only speak to the audience once during the show, as he wants the “music and the images to tell the story”. Then he explains that they’ve just come back from Poland, where he discovered that the plane on which theirs is based – Spitfire Mk Vb AA853 from 302 Squadron – was flown by a Polish pilot. “Which is a weird coincidence. We forget that young people a third of my age were going off to fight against nazism, and the Spitfire is the symbol of that.” Then he introduces The Clansman, a song about the 13th-century Scottish knight William Wallace, who “stood up to the English king”, announcing: “There are people who are trying to fuck with our liberty and freedom.” As 10,000 people chant “Freedom! Freedom!” it seems Legacy of the Beast is a sort of conceptual state-of-the-world address, principally anti-war and anti-fascist, delivered via a heavy metal opera, ided into four sections: war, religion, hell, damnation – all the cheery stuff. The threat of dark forces isn’t the most original notion in a genre where demons and devils come along like buses, but makes for a powerful, brilliantly staged, two-hour rock show in which each song is a banger, from opener Aces High to the closing Run to the Hills. Maiden aren’t known for greatest hits sets, but the veteran rockers invest songs which haven’t been played for years – Flight of Icarus, for example, not since 1986 – with rejuvenated energy. Although this is principally a demonstration of blistering hard rock, they push at its boundaries, with monastic chanting, moments of Mogwai-like quiet beauty and sections where the band’s three guitarists interlock like a classical orchestra. Janick Gers swings his instrument around his head and plays it with his toe Dave Murray theatrically raises an eyebrow to the camera. Central to it all is Dickinson, a 59-year-old cancer survivor who is leather-clad, sweat-drenched, again defiantly longhaired and never stops running all night. By the time they get to The Number of the Beast – for which the band play inside a mocked-up Hades – the house is beyond erupting. It’s never made clear who those dark forces threatening us are (Trump? The far right? Barbers?) or whether “unelected bureaucracy” opponent Dickinson’s Polish experience has made him reconsider his previous support for Brexit. But in terms of live, theatrical heavy metal, this show is a classic of the genre.

It warned against what it described as a “blind Brexit”, and in a rare criticism of the European commission said the EU should not offer May a face-saving deal in which many of the major issues were deferred for negotiation during the transition after the UK has legally left the bloc.There are concerns amongst some Remain backers that the chief EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is prepared to make the offer if it has the endorsement of Germany and France, on the basis that the majority of EU leaders fear the possibility of no-deal scenario. There is also a concern that details of the future relationship cannot be negotiated in the short time available.Until now it had been assumed that France and Germany would insist that any political declaration on future relations would include details of the planned future trading relationship after Brexit. A relatively brief declaration on future ties will not be a formal treaty, unlike the withdrawal agreement, which will give details of future UK payments, the Irish border and citizens’ rights. A vague deal on future relations is more likely to be acceptable to May’s MPs, and harder for the Labour party to oppose.Remain campaigners have been anxious for months about how the EU would play the final negotiations and whether commission officials would be willing to defer many issues so long as any agreement contained legal guarantees on the Irish border.The Remain campaign has no systematic diplomatic contact with the key EU players, and is reliant on the ad hoc contacts made by senior figures such as Sir Nick Clegg or Tony Blair.German sources insisted that despite several reports from Brussels and EU officials, no instruction had been issued to the commission to back a vague blueprint, adding that clear guarantees about the planned future trading and security relationship would be required by Berlin.But in a sign of alarm in the Remain campaign, Chris Leslie MP said: “A blind Brexit would take the UK to the same place as a no-deal Brexit, but without the clarity. The idea that the fundamental contradictions of the government’s Brexit policy can be more easily resolved after the UK has left the EU is simply ludicrous.“A blind Brexit is being talked about because some see it as a short-term face-saving deal for both the British government and the European Union, both of which are now terrified that concluding with a failure to agree a deal will result in a humiliating no-deal Brexit.“With the EU27 governments and the EU commission wanting to spare Theresa May’s blushes, there is a risk we end up with a fake deal to save face.”The People’s Vote campaign insisted that the commission was wrong to think there was a Commons majority for May’s Chequers proposals or for no deal. It said that with public pressure growing, and Labour keeping the door open for a second referendum, MPs were moving further and further away from a no-deal Brexit by the day. The campaign, sensing that the polling momentum is with a second referendum as a way of breaking the Commons deadlock, wants more European leaders to say more loudly that the EU will keep the door open to the UK remaining in the EU. May will hold private Brexit talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c857f8f99e1390765bd4aff415fc173fa1f302/685_773_3921_2353/master/3921.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f1300ce5a47df75a2eedef40df17ebe","title":"jeremy hunt on brexit we are heading for no deal by accident","story":"Probability of exit without deal ‘increasing by the day’, UK foreign secretary saysThe Brexit process is currently “heading for no deal by accident”, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said during talks in Austria, stepping up his warnings about a potential collapse in talks.“This is not project fear, this is project reality,” Hunt told a press conference in Vienna alongside his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl.“We have to make a decision on Britain’s future relationship with the EU by the end of this year and we have to be very honest with ourselves about the choices that we face. At the moment we are heading for no deal by accident.”His comments follow similar warnings on Tuesday during meetings in France, when he told the Evening Standard: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European commission, who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink.”Hunt’s diplomatic efforts will be followed this week by talks between Theresa May and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. May will leave the Italian lakes, where she is on holiday, to go to Macron’s country retreat on the Mediterranean coast on Friday.Speaking in Vienna, Hunt said a no-deal Brexit would “have a profound impact on the relations between Britain and EU countries for a generation”. It would, he said, be a “huge geo-strategic mistake”.Kneissl, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, played down the concern while saying that Austria and the EU were “prepared for the different possible scenarios”.She later said that the talks with Hunt had been “excellent and inspiring” and insisted that Austria was pursuing “a pragmatic approach … prepared for the different possible scenarios of Brexit”. At the press conference Hunt stressed the importance of Austria’s current role, after May travelled to Vienna last week to meet the country’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.“Austria has a special role because of its EU presidency,” he said. “And so all we say is, looking at your huge experience of foreign policy and historical knowledge, let’s not make this one of those moments where a terrible mistake is made which we are still talking about in 20 or 30 years. “Let’s have a pragmatic solution that allows that deep and special partnership, friendship, between the UK and Europe to continue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0340c7f14ec1e85965dba1adc6f587a86f7aa5cf/0_24_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e981789765375680e4a62870002a4d6c","title":"what would you stockpile to prepare for no deal brexit","story":"Amid warnings of shortages of food and products if a no-deal Brexit took place, let us know what you would choose to stockpile The UK imports half its food from abroad, and industry groups have warned new tariffs and custom delays from a no-deal Brexit could lead to empty supermarket shelves and higher prices.

If this research gives the government a chance to get off this self-imposed hook, then it’s a good thing. But God help people in the meantime.”The blueprint for the study is set out in the leaked document, which is titled: “Update on commissioning food banks research.” It explains that the report will cost £217,000 – and that funding “has now been approved”.It says the year-long project aims to find out how many people are being forced to seek emergency food aid and why. The study, due to be published in October next year, will rely on a survey of 600 food bank managers and 500 food bank users, as well as in-depth interviews with a much smaller number of people who regularly use the service.Under the heading “Factors driving the use of food banks”, the document describes seven objectives. As well as assessing the role of DWP policies, it says the research should look at “how far economic factors have influenced the use of food banks”.The blueprint also acknowledges the risks in undertaking the research, including “negative results”.Food banks provide help for families and iniduals who are in financial hardship and are provided by organisations such as the Trussell Trust.Many of those on the front line have said that government policies are behind the rise, particularly the move to universal credit, which replaces a range of benefits with one payment.The Trussell Trust said that in areas where universal credit had been in place for 12 months or more, food banks were four times as busy as elsewhere, as long waits for payments and administrative problems forced people to seek help.Last year a study by Oxford University academics warned that benefit freezes and welfare changes such as universal credit and cuts to disability payments were likely to drive up food bank use in future years.However, the government has been reluctant to accept this, insisting there is no proven link.The DWP study could completely undermine this position because the questions researchers intend to ask include some focusing on the impact of the transition to universal credit, and whether this has been “a driver of food bank usage”.Another question states: “To what extent does the administration of benefits ... contribute to food bank usage?”Field, a former Labour minister in charge of welfare reform, said: “The government knows perfectly well there have been real cuts in benefits that have particularly hit families with children and this has led to hardship and destitution. I hope this is a sign that the secretary of state is having a change of heart.”Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, an area she says has been hit particularly hard by the rollout of universal credit, was highly critical of the DWP’s position.“Four or five years after so many of us have raised concerns, they are finally doing some research that they don’t want anyone to know about. “Frankly, it’s just not good enough. They should be researching their own culpability in pushing people into destitution, setting rules that are impossible to follow.“For years the government has been holding to a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ strategy. If they are now recognising they are a cause of the problem, the question is, what are they going to do about it? They should stop universal credit for a start.”A DWP spokesperson said: “As we have said previously, we are currently reviewing research carried out by organisations to add to our understanding of food bank use and will consider further research to add to our evidence base, to ensure we’re providing the best possible support for vulnerable groups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe6c9bc84fbe302df511d77896548afebc494f41/32_44_2494_1497/master/2494.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6eb78e8b2b1f51327a8019206f5fa2","title":"european sports championships glasgow liftoff","story":"Athletics takes top billing in the inaugural 11-day jamboree that begins in Glasgow and has the backing of seven federationsA neat trick involving a sleight of hand is about to be performed in front of our eyes and the illusionists trust we will marvel at the spectacle and beg for more.The first European Sports Championships begin in Glasgow on Thursday and conclude in Berlin 11 days later. Eight sports are stacking their continental showpieces in a single deck and allowing the organisers and television producers to shuffle the cards around in a game of who has top trumps next?There will be athletics in Berlin, swimming, cycling and gymnastics in Glasgow, and ing in Edinburgh. Rowing and triathlon will take place in a country park in Motherwell. Oh, and there is golf at Gleneagles. All packaged together for the first time and offered to the world.“The key thing is to create something which has much broader appeal than stand-alone championships,” the co-founder and director, Paul Bristow, says. “Most of them lacked any general cut-through with the public. So you transform something which only appeals to dedicated fans of the sport.“You might be a cycling fan who knows when the track cycling championships take place and where they can be found on your TV guide. But if you’re a casual sports fan, you won’t know where or when, or the winners. They’ll know when the Olympic Games are on. When the Commonwealth Games are on.“The athletes in these sports come to life. They become personalities and people realise their phenomenal achievements. We felt that being the best out of 850 million people on the planet was something that needed to be properly recognised.”It is a reasonable ambition and has persuaded the BBC to carve out 12 hours per day to dart from one venue to another on the promise that co-ordinated timetables will concoct a seamless stream of highlights. “And to the TV viewer,” Bristow says, “it doesn’t matter if you go 2,000 metres from the velodrome to the track or 2,000 kilometres across Europe.”Swiss sprinter Pascal Mancini has been barred from the European championships by his country\u0027s athletics federation after posting far-right messages on his Facebook page.\u0026nbspPascal Mancini has recently posted controversial posts on his athlete Facebook page with far-right thinking that violate both an agreement signed with Swiss Athletics and the association\u0027s Code of Conduct, Swiss Athletics said in a statement.\u0026nbsp By signing the agreement, Mancini committed to refrain from publishing any discriminatory or racist contributions related to athletics.\u0026nbspIt said it had withdrawn his licence so that he could not compete in the 100 metres in Berlin, where this year\u0027s European championships are being held in August, and opened disciplinary proceedings.\u0026nbspMancini has said he is the victim of a media campaign against him. If I were a racist, I would say so, he told one newspaper. ReutersWhile it feels a more engaging prospect than the poorly received European Games which barely engineered a ripple in Baku in 2015, the quality may vary.For athletics, gymnastics and swimming, this is the focal point of their calendar. The track and outdoor elements of cycling will bring sufficient stardust. However rowing is a tough sell. Triathlon’s European showpiece has rarely lured its leading lights and, while golf’s mixed team format injects a novelty factor, Great Britain’s Callum Shinkwin – the world No 228 – will be the highest-ranked male. This suggests this is a prize few covet, even among those not in action at the USPGA Championship.Ultimately it will all come back to eyeballs. Research by the European Broadcasting Union indicates that by aggregating sports as in the Olympics, the public can be persuaded to tune in for the pebbles and the gems. “And even though the athletics championships has a long history in its own right, we feel being a part of this will have a supercharging effect on Berlin,” says the European Athletics head of communications, James Mulligan.“We’ve seen the fragmentation of TV channels and how that eats away at viewership. But this has sustained our place on BBC One, on ARD, on France Télévisions, and it means Berlin and Glasgow get the major event treatment which is good for us and good for the athletes.”The cost of the concept – about two per cent of the price of an Olympiad – may attract other hosts. Glasgow has spent £90m, a relatively inexpensive means to obtain further returns on the sumptuous investments made for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.“It is a very affordable multisport event, even with 40 per cent of the athletes that you’d get at an Olympics,” Bristow says. “We’ve achieved it firstly because we’ve not put too many sports into the programme. It is big but sustainable. There are no athletes villages, just hotels and student accommodation, and we’re using existing facilities, so there is no white elephant to gather dust.”London, sources say, has passed on staging the whole of the next championships in 2022. Other cities and regions will wander along this week to evaluate and be wooed. They will find track and field in Berlin’s Olympiastadion has inevitably shifted seats by the dozen but interest across the North Sea has been patchy. Gymnastics has sold well in Glasgow, cycling too. Other sports, less so.Give it a little time, Bristow says, for the rabbit to leap wholly out of the hat. “Look at other events which have started over the past 25 years. The Rugby World Cup – no one really knew about it until it happened. The Champions League needed some work at the start. It took a while for people to know what it was. The cricket World Cup was the same.“For all of them, the first editions were never at the level they are now. We’ve always been realistic that this is an event that will grow over time and people will see what it is like when it hits their screen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea7e55f1cf53f7a6a633ec216ff49133714f05b1/0_101_1974_1184/master/1974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f13c2e34fe74a3fc1cd4900e0590a97","title":"virat kohli mocks joe root mic drop celebration run out","story":"Virat Kohli may have lit the touch-paper on what could prove to be a fiery Test series after the India captain ran out Joe Root on the opening day at Edgbaston and then sent his opposite number packing with a ‘mic\u0026nbspdrop’ celebration.It was Root’s own version of the gesture that signed off the one-day series victory by England at Headingley a fortnight ago. Kohli certainly relished offering a repeat when he capitalised on an error by Root and Jonny Bairstow, removing the former for 80 with a smart pick up and throw from the leg side as the pair attempted a second run.While his accompanying comments may have included some swearing – and the International Cricket Council is cracking down on player behaviour – there appeared to be little evidence by which the match referee, Jeff Crowe, could hand down a disciplinary charge given Kohli’s distance from the stump microphones and on-field officials.England’s Keaton Jennings looked to play down the incident after stumps – “Everybody is entitled to celebrate how they want to. That’s how he celebrated and that’s cool,” he said – and offered a positive spin on a disappointing day for the host side, with Root’s demise the first of a six‑wicket collapse after tea that saw them close on 285 for nine.England have confirmed Ben Stokes could yet feature in the second Test at Lord’s next Thursday should his trial for affray in Bristol, which begins on Monday, be adjourned on its first or second day. The all-rounder, who has pleaded not guilty to the charge, is due to miss the match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068cdf3210236b460bc60150da9400e5813d9aff/120_206_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48984cf213479b422a9a044655b76eaf","title":"yorkshire day root bairstow england india first test","story":"It was Yorkshire Day on Wednesday, a rare opportunity for those of us unlucky enough to be born in the other 47 counties to hear Yorkshire folk talk about where they are from and how proud they are about it. It was not immediately clear how this made it any different from the other 364 days in the year but at Edgbaston the day had a strong Yorkshire flavour to it, as conspicuous as the Yorkshire brass band who parp away during the tea-break. There were three Yorkshiremen in the England team – Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow and Adil Rashid– and between them they dominated the build-up to the series and defined the first day’s play.The celebrations got off to an inauspicious start. Colin Graves, whose tenure as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board seems to be one long attempt to belie his own reputation as a no-nonsense Yorkshireman, was presented with a silver plate and a small statue of a bear and ragged staff before the start of play to mark the start of England’s 1,000th men’s Test match. Graves is keen to prove that, despite everyone else’s reservations, the sport is in safe hands. Inevitably, then, he held the plate but fumbled the bear, blushed and gathered it back up off the grass.It got worse. India revealed that they had decided to leave Che Pujara out of their team. Pujara made a point of preparing for this tour by playing with Yorkshire in the months before the series started. The plan did not quite work out as he had hoped. In six Championship matches he made 172 runs at an average of 14. So in four months of cricket he essentially managed to play his way out of the Test team. He may have had a better chance of making the side if, like Rashid, he had refused to play red-ball cricket at all.Root and Bairstow did better. They marked it with a partnership of 104, which started when England were wobbling at 112 for three. They were separated, in the end, by a misunderstanding about whether or not they should chance a second run to Virat Kohli at midwicket. The answer, they discovered when Kohli hurled the ball in on the turn and hit the stumps from 20 yards, was probably not.Kohli pressed the point by blowing a couple of kisses, holding his finger to his lips, and then pretending to drop a mic to the ground in a sly imitation of Root’s celebration after his match-winning century in the ODI at Headingley a couple of weeks ago.Root was run out for 80. It has been 20 innings since he last scored a hundred. He made 136 here last year against West Indies and he has made it past 50 in 11 of them. This one felt especially painful, since he had played so assiduously through the morning and afternoon, determined, it seemed, finally to make good on a hundred. Nobody has scored more Test fifties than Root has since he made his debut, in 2012, but plenty – Kohli, Steve Smith, David Warner, Kane Williamson and Younis Khan – have made more centuries.There are worse problems for a batsman to have but Root’s seems to be contagious. Since he became captain last year, England have scored more fifties than any other team, 52, but have managed to turn only nine of them into scores of a hundred or more. In the same time India have made 32 fifties and 19 hundreds, Australia 31 and 15. This in turn makes Root’s flaw all the more conspicuous because, if no one else in the top six is playing match-defining innings, there is even more of an onus on the team’s best batsman, Root, to stand up and do it for them.Three overs later Bairstow fell too, when he played-on as he tried to cut Umesh Yadav away square. He had not only run his captain out but compounded the mistake by being dismissed so soon after. He would have been wise to give Root just a little more time to cool off before he joined him back in the dressing room and to have come armed with the defence that at least he had gone on to make a century. Instead the run out turned out to be the turning point of the innings. England collapsed to 285 for nine. They had lost six for 67.Yorkshire got England out of trouble and Yorkshire landed them right back in it again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebfb8206faa45b2f4c8c8b7d8c99f40e25dcfb90/126_153_2303_1382/master/2303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dcf0226ea47ad8dcb0711c63aef04c","title":"readers travel photography competition july the winners","story":"This month’s selection of travel imagery mixes quiet moments and superlative views.

The site was not evacuated, and tourists already inside were allowed to finish their visits.Staff are angry over a decision last month to start setting aside half of the Eiffel Tower’s daily tickets for people who buy them in advance online and schedule a time for their visit.The tower’s management has also started reserving specific lifts for each type of ticket holder, a move that “creates lines that are at times monstrous and often lopsided,” the CGT union said.During off-peak times for pre-booked tickets, such as the early afternoon, the reserved lift might be half empty despite queues of up to three hours for walk-in visitors.High demand at the lift for pre-booked ticket holders also means people have to wait long beyond their scheduled visit time.Hector had travelled from Monterey, Mexico, with his wife and children for their first trip to France, and was just about to reach the lifts when the doors shut. “We’ve been here for two and a half hours, waiting for nothing,” he said.“We will take a look for tomorrow, but we will need to buy another ticket,” he said, because pre-booked tickets will only be reimbursed, not exchanged for another time slot.“Employees’ patience has run out,” the CGT’s Denis Vavassori said on Monday, adding that many visitors were unhappy with the long waits. Staff want all lifts to be available to all visitors, no matter what kind of ticket they have bought.SETE, the company that runs the site, says it sells 10,000 online tickets for the tower each day and that “the waiting time is very short”.“For visitors who come without tickets, the waiting time at the checkouts at the foot of the Eiffel Tower is exactly the same as last year, while the number of visitors has increased,” it said.The tower has been hit by repeated strikes by its 300-strong staff in recent years over issues ranging from pick-pockets to maintenance work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51866dec324e6de0e72aefae56da0ba56edd6c76/0_166_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990026151705e2321af881c08e83bee6","title":"have you been affected by street harassment share your stories","story":"We would like to hear from people affected by catcalling and street harassment – tell us how it makes you feel A French woman has been praised for her courage in standing up to a street harasser in Paris.

A pall of smoke filled the sky. On cracked pavements there was glass and – in some places – blood.Terrified commuters took cover in shop doorways or behind walls still covered in posters bearing portraits of election candidates as volleys of shots rang out and stones flew through the air. Witnesses reported seeing soldiers beating people with makeshift batons.Opposition supporters have expressed growing impatience over delays in releasing the results of the historic vote, the first since Robert Mugabe was ousted after four decades in charge.The scenes of violence contrasted dramatically with the jubilation and joy on the same streets that greeted the end of Mugabe’s rule in November. Then soldiers were seen as patriotic heroes. On Wednesday afternoon, in the opposition stronghold of Harare at least, they were seen once more as thuggish defenders of the ruling Zanu-PF party.Early clashes took place outside the headquarters of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), which opposition supporters accuse of bias, and spread rapidly.Some chanted: “This is war,” while others shouted slogans calling for the country’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, to step down.Alex Kamasa, 30, an unemployed graduate, said: “They are desperate. It is a big robbery. At least Mugabe rigged with brains. These guys rig like school children. They insult us.”The country’s justice minister, Ziyambi Ziyambi, said the army had been deployed to disperse a violent crowd and restore “peace and tranquility.”“The presence of the army is not to intimidate people but to ensure that law and order is maintained. They are there to assist the police,” Ziyambi said in an interview broadcast on eNCA television. “They are there as a people’s army to ensure that peace and security prevails.”The authorities are under increasing pressure to release the results of Monday’s poll, which pitted Chamisa, a 40-year-old lawyer, pastor and leader of the main opposition party the Movement for Democratic Change, against Mnangagwa, 75, a longtime Mugabe aide and head of the Zanu-PF. Zimbabwe’s rulers know that the widespread perception overseas that they have rigged an election would block the country’s reintegration into the international community and deny it the huge bailout package needed to avoid economic meltdown.So too could scenes such as those seen in Harare on Wednesday afternoon. Images of soldiers firing on civilian protesters recall the darkest days of Mugabe’s rule and are a serious setback to Zanu-PF’s effort to improve its image overseas.The US embassy said it was “deeply concerned by events unfolding in Harare”, called on leaders of all parties to call for calm and urged the military “to use restraint in dispersing” protesters.Less than an hour before the violence, election monitors called for votes to be counted in an open and timely way. Zanu-PF has already won a massive majority in parliament after sweeping rural constituencies by significant margins, official results show, but the parliamentary outcome does not necessarily indicate voters’ choice of head of state. Under electoral law the result in the presidential vote has to be announced by 4 August.Elmar Brok, the head of the first EU monitors to be allowed into Zimbabwe for 16 years, praised an “opening up of political space” before the poll but said the government had failed to ensure a level playing field and accused the ZEC of bias.Brok called on the ZEC to make detailed results public to ensure the credibility of the election given earlier shortcomings. Other monitors also expressed concerns as the count went into a third day.“Election day is only a snapshot of a long electoral process,” said the US congresswoman Karen Bass, one of the monitors deployed jointly by the US International Republican Institute and National Democratic Institute.“It is vital to see the electoral process to its conclusion, and it is still too early to make an assessment on the nature of these elections.”If no candidate wins more than half of the votes in the presidential election, there will be a runoff in five weeks. Negotiations to form a coalition government are another possibility.The two presidential candidates represent dramatically different ideologies and political styles, as well as generations. Pre-election opinion polls gave Mnangagwa, a dour former spy chief known as “the Crocodile” due to his reputation for ruthless cunning, a slim lead over Chamisa, a brilliant if sometimes wayward orator."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580040.1532886951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gp shortage i didn t see any future in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Patrick Kelly at Dr Kelly’s Medical Treatment Facility in the Golan Heights. Dr Ruth Caden completed her general practice training in rural Ireland, witnessing the ever-increasing workload with reduced resources that her GP colleagues were facing.“They could often not take holidays as there was no cover, they would do unpaid house calls in the evenings after work. Although they did it largely without complaint, I could see how this could lead to burnout,” Caden says.“The GPs I worked with were tireless in their work for their communities and invested heavily in their practices, some in primary care centres, only for the Government to unilaterally slash the practice income by 38 per cent.”Caden worked in Ireland for six years before leaving for Vancouver Island, Canada. Remuneration and working conditions for GPs are better in places such as Canada and Australia, according to Caden. But if the Government was to make a serious commitment to changing working conditions for GPs, she would consider returning.“So far, unfortunately I have seen nothing to show that they are serious about this, and I have a significant concern that general practice as we know it will be killed off by this Government. This will impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, who disproportionately rely on general practice.”Last home for a holiday in October, Caden sees little hope of returning as working conditions for GPs remain difficult.Dr Dermot Coffey was easily persuaded to leave his homeland in 2002 with his partner due to the “awful working hours” for doctors in Ireland at the time.“The conditions weren’t even the worst they had been – we at least got paid for the hours we worked – but I remember working out we averaged 78 hours a week that whole year, and every fourth week was 100 hours,” he says.Coffey and his partner (now wife) headed for New Zealand where they live with their three children, despite a few stints working in Ireland in 2004 and 2009.A recent holiday to Ireland prompted him to think about his reasons for leaving and roused mixed feelings on returning.“Like a lot of people I imagine I’ve felt the pull back a lot more strongly since we’ve had kids, and although I’ve a brother and his family out here now, the distance seems a lot further than it did when we moved 16 years ago,” he says.“I’ve never been one to hold with the view that medicine is a ‘vocation’, or that Irish graduates should be bonded to the country, but I have felt in more recent times a feeling that we as medics should all be chipping in to help the Irish health system, and a desire to make whatever little difference I could has added to the drawback.”Coffey finished his GP training in 2007, worked as a GP in Wellington until 2016 and has just returned to work in Christchurch after spending two years in Melbourne, where his wife completed training as a geneticist.“Would I come back? I would. I wouldn’t expect perfection but I’d like to see some hope for general practice first.”Motivated less by a desire to avoid the challenging working conditions in Ireland and more by a yearning to care for some of the world’s poorest populations, Commandant Dr Patrick Kelly joined the Defence Forces in 2014 after completing his GP training in Ireland.Kelly is acting senior medical officer with the UN’s Quick Reaction Force, and will leave Syria for a holiday in Ireland in August. He will enjoy a three-week break here before returning to the Golan Heights as part of the UN mission, hosted by the Syrian Arab Republic.The Waterford native became a member of the Order of Malta aged 12 and grew to appreciate caring for people and the human element of healthcare.“A career in the Defence Forces has offered me the opportunity to provide healthcare to people who really need it refugees, internally displaced populations or to persons living in resource-poor settings. I’ve been able to care for various groups from orphans of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone to internally displaced persons as a result of the Syrian civil war.His current role is to provide for the primary care needs of 130 soldiers, as well as preventing the outbreak of disease, which can occur in people situated in close quarters.His other role is as a doctor of the Quick Reaction Force, which is in effect an emergency service for UN unarmed military observers who are overseeing the area of separation between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic as part of the UNDOF mandate.Kelly says he may one day consider working in Irish general practice, but for now, on the whole, enjoys the variety offered by his work abroad.“You miss family events, but you have to take the good with the bad,” he says.Dr Cróchán O’Sullivan, consultant interventional cardiologist, returned home to live in Ireland in recent weeks after spending seven years working in Switzerland.The Kildare native graduated in medicine in 2004. Since then he has moved city and country 11 times.In 2011, he went to Switzerland. O’Sullivan wanted to be an interventional cardiologist and there was no training opportunities in Ireland.“The main reason people move is for training, I think,” he says.“When you’re training in Ireland you have a very pessimistic outlook of the future . . . I didn’t see any future in Ireland. I felt that I had to go abroad and make the most of it over there.”Amid the pessimism and lack of training opportunities in his chosen speciality O’Sullivan, a qualified doctor, made the difficult decision to move abroad to train, unpaid.“When you move abroad first you don’t get paid, you don’t get a salary for working for the hospital and have to find your own funding. When I moved to Switzerland first I got a grant from the HSE that lasted a year . . . then I was lucky to get another grant for a year.”Last year, he and his wife had a child, which he says “was the impetus for us to come home”.Looking for a job in Ireland, he spoke to “very disillusioned” colleagues working in the public sector due to consultant pay concerns and limited resources.Having specialised in innovative, new valve procedures in Zurich, O’Sullivan wanted to continue this work in Ireland and private hospitals, with superior resources, offered better opportunities, he says.He has taken up a role in the Bon Secours Hospital Cork and is excited about the positive outlook there. Whereas the outlook within the public sector “appeared to be more negative”, he says.Irish academic fellow in geriatric medicine Dr Mary Ní Lochlainn, who works for the National Health Service in London, says she cannot “imagine ever not being paid for my work or having to chase my due pay” unlike her Irish counterparts.Ní Lochlainn has never worked for the HSE and has only been in Irish hospitals as a medical student, but even as a patient here found the two-tier health system “very troubling”.She chose to move abroad for a number of reasons.“I was influenced by many fantastic consultants in geriatric medicine as a medical student in Trinity, all of whom had spent time training in the UK. So I definitely felt I would go to the UK at some point. I also moved for the training opportunities and to experience the NHS, as well as the more forgiving hours and better working conditions.“The NHS is the most incredible system, I feel deeply privileged to work there. Money is never a consideration in my day-to-day clinical work, nobody mentions insurance, and everyone gets the same treatment regardless of their classcolourcreedbank balance. It is not perfect, with Tory-underfunding, but nevertheless it is a phenomenal institution.”Ní Lochlainn, like junior doctors in Ireland, must move hospitals as part of her training post. But, she only moves between hospitals in south London.“I don’t have to move to opposite ends of the country away from loved ones, moving house regularly, etc. This is a big consideration of mine when I think about moving home,” she says.Most importantly, she believes unequal pay for consultants is a huge factor for Irish doctors abroad. “Why should those of us who qualified later be penalised and paid less for the same work?” she asks. “It is utterly demoralising. I worry about my parents and extended family being in Ireland where the waiting lists are ever growing. Unless we sort out this demoralisation, there will be more empty posts, and no doctors to clear these waiting lists.“I’m not sure the general public realise that they are the ones who will suffer if these issues are not resolved by Government as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582371.1533063721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar government can be flexible on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  pictured during a media briefing at Government Buildings. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stressed that the Government is prepared to be “flexible” on the exact content of the Border “backstop” but would not compromise on what it must achieve.Mr Varadkar made the comments while speaking to journalists on Tuesday at a briefing at Government Buildings.“When it comes to the backstop, our position has always been what matters is not the detailed legal text, it’s the outcome, and so what we want the backstop to achieve is a guarantee that there won’t be a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said.He said that while the Government was “totally enthusiastic” about solving the problem of the post-Brexit Border when the EU and the UK agree on a future relationship, the Irish Government would not back down on its insistence that the backstop is part of a withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU – due to be agreed by mid-October.In the absence of a withdrawal treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU next March without a transition period – meaning that EU laws and agreements would cease to apply to the UK overnight.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.“We have to have the backstop as well. We have to have that assurance that unless and until a new solution is in place, that there won’t be a Border.“But yes, we can be flexible certainly on the content of it so long as the outcome is the one that we need,” Mr Varadkar said.Senior Government sources said they expect little progress on Brexit in the coming weeks, but that the UK and EU negotiating teams would restart talks in the middle of August in the hope of reaching a breakthrough on the Border issue in September.Sources acknowledge that the British ask – to have the UK effectively remain in the single market for goods – would have advantages for Ireland, but say it is unlikely to be accepted by Paris or Berlin, as it would compromise the EU’s single market rules.Mr Varadkar also indicated that the Irish and British governments will make another push in the autumn to bring the Northern parties back to the table at Stormont, with a view to resuscitating the powersharing institutions before the end of the year.“We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together. I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult, but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running,” he said.He said that\u0026nbspa Border poll at this time would be “very isive and unsuccessful”.“Now is not the time to get into all that,” Mr Varadkar said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Ko SasakiThe New York TimesThe dawn air in Tokyo is still and thick, like a heavy wet overcoat. By early morning, the thermometer is at 28 degrees and starting its climb to a suffocating afternoon peak of 36.In this heat, children surface early. Ours sleep with the air conditioner and fans whirring away through the night, heads lying on rubber ice-pillows. They wake complaining of dry throats.The humidity seeps into futons and clothes and makes the journey from home to train station a sweaty trial. Trains stuffed with perspiring commuters are a great well of rush-hour sullenness.Tokyo summers are rarely pleasant but this year has made everyone a bit neurotic. Heat warnings ticker for days across the TV screen. The weather killed at least 50 people in the city in July alone.The population of Waterford – more than 50,000 people – has been hospitalised with heatstroke. School trips have been called off, outdoor pools closed and summer festivals cancelled.Just before school broke up for holidays, a boy the same age as our oldest fell into a coma and never woke up. He had been out collecting insects in the sun with his classmates.His death panicked some schools into cancelling closing ceremonies in stiflingly hot gymnasiums. Big-city classrooms have air conditioners but their country cousins are often left to nature’s whim.Kids have to be watched, warn the old folk. The children dash out and play for hours, ignoring the telltale signs of heatstroke: tingling extremities, goosebumps, strained breathing, and disorientation.Yet most of the victims are old themselves, passing away unnoticed – sometimes in pairs, such as sisters Shizuko (93) and Miyoko Ogata (84), found lying near each other in their Tokyo flat on July 23rd.Raised in the burnt-out austerity of the post-war years, the elderly often shun air conditioners, either because of the cost or the belief that they weaken the body’s natural defences.Instead, they rely on old tricks: going for walks in the sun to beat the heat downing mugicha (roasted barley tea), cold noodles and heavily salted green beans cooling themselves with paper fans.With heat records tumbling, such traditional remedies are becoming redundant. Another vitamin-rich antidote to the summer – sweetened broiled eel – is running out.Five years ago, after decades of overconsumption, the government designated the eel an endangered species. Prices for it are rising steadily. Japan is the world’s largest consumer.Disappearing fish and overheating planet or not, life goes on. Kids in the park toss baseballs and afterwards scoff kakigori – sweetened shaved ice that is as quintessentially Japanese as sushi.Roads must be fixed. Across Tokyo, men in hard hats descend on potholes and cracks like antibodies around a virus. Some wear clothes fitted with small battery-operated fans.The TV says one-quarter of all skilled construction workers in the country are 65 or older. With the pressure on to finish building before the 2020 Olympics, most work six days a week. The government says it will promote a five-day workweek even as the country struggles with its worst labour crunch in decades. Nobody knows how this is going to be done.In the evening we read how air conditioners are causing summers to heat up even more. Millions of families like ours turn them on to cool down, using more energy, which triggers more emissions.We try opening all the windows in our breezeless apartment. After an hour, the temperature hovers above 26 degrees and the kids toss and turn on damp sheets. The cooler comes back on.In bed, I pick up a story by writer Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904), probably Ireland’s most famous export to this country. In The Dream of a Summer Day he transports himself back to Japan in the eighth-century.“Summer days were then as now,” he writes, “all drowsy and tender blue, with only some light pure white clouds hanging over the mirror of the sea.

Photograph: Alain JocardAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has appealed over the heads of Brussels negotiators directly to France and Germany to try to force the European Commission to strike a “sensible and pragmatic” Brexit deal.Ahead of talks with his opposite number in Paris, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of waiting for Britain “to blink” in negotiations as he claimed the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal were “increasing by the day”.“That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,” he said. “There is a real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.”Mr Hunt’s warning came as the Élysée Palace announced that British prime minister Theresa May will join French president Emmanuel Macron at his summer home, Fort de Brégançon, in the south of France on Friday when her holiday in the Italian lakes comes to an end.Ms May’s office confirmed that the pre-planned visit would include talks on the prime minister’s Chequers deal but that the pair would then be joined by Philip May and the president’s wife, Brigitte Macron, for a private dinner.In an interview before his trip to France, Mr Hunt warned the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that his approach to the negotiations would inflict a “breakdown in relations and trust” between Britain and the continent which would be a “profound geo-strategic mistake”.He told the Evening Standard: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink ...“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”However, Brussels insiders have repeatedly pointed out that Mr Barnier and his Brussels negotiating team are only acting on the orders of France, Germany and the rest of the 27 EU countries. Any inflexibility originates from the nation states.France has taunted the UK by offering to roll out the red carpet to British-based financial firms after Brexit, but Mr Hunt said a no-deal Brexit would be an economic “tragedy” for both countries.“If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial,” he said, alluding to the flow of money from the City of London, which could become more difficult to access if there was no agreement.“The City itself would find a way to thrive, whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. If it became a low-tax, low-regulation offshoot fully outside the EU, it would find a way to thrive in those circumstances. But for European businesses the impact would be profound,” Mr Hunt said. –  Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interests.“This impact can be either direct, or indirect through the loss of regional stability negatively affecting trade, causing migration pressures and creating ungoverned spaces in which terrorism and criminality can flourish.”Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThe plan says UK aid that builds up health services in the world\u0027s poorest countries goes “to protecting UK citizens from significant disease threats and securing the UK’s long term national security.”Any new deadly epidemic is likely to come from an animal disease infecting humans. Around 60 per cent of all human diseases and three quarters of all new and emerging infectious diseases are these zoonotic diseases. Recent examples include Ebola and H5N1 bird flu.As growing populations encroach on natural habitats and developing countries demand more animal foods, there will be increasing overlap between humans, domestic livestock and wildlife that could see new diseases jump from one group to another.An outbreak infecting UK livestock of crops could also be highly costly and damaging, the strategy says.Global health - Major threats to UK populationThe strategy says that a deliberate biological attack on the UK is currently judged unlikely. But it says such an attack on the UK or its armed forces “are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term”.Conflicts or economic crises also risk increasing the threat from diseases as health services collapse and immunisation programmes halt for diseases such as polio, diptheria and measlesIn the long term, “climate change will also increase the likelihood of pests and vector-borne diseases spreading to new areas of the globe, as they and their carriers are able to survive in countries where environments would previously not have supported their circulation”.Mr Wallace said: “Britain is a global nation, open to the world and outward facing. This means we are exposed to these risks, both at home and overseas, but it also gives us the opportunity to work with international partners to tackle such threats at source.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsYoung Labour voters losing faith in party leadershipPotholes to worsen as English roads are only resurfaced once every 100 yearsBritish court recognises Sharia Law in landmark orce caseFormer Met chiefs join outcry against police probe into British soldiers in Northern Ireland Children\u0026#39s author faces £1m payout after \u0026#39terrorising\u0026#39 actor neighbour with \u0026#39monstrously out of control\u0026#39 gardenGiant lump of polystyrene found off Cornish coast is \u0026#39biggest piece of litter\u0026#39 recovered from UK watersChoo-choo not train: talking baby words to toddlers helps them learn to speak faster, study findsBritish firm ordered to pay €60,000 by French court for breaching employee\u0026#39s \u0026#39right to disconnect\u0026#39 from workZimbabwe elections: Three dead as opposition protests shatter hopes for peaceful processEurope braced for hottest day in history as farmers granted emergency access to river waterNew Maria cast in West Side Story following \u0026#39whitewashing\u0026#39 backlashFormer EDL leader Tommy Robinson freed from prison after judges quash contempt ruling Wiltshire air ambulance grounded amid fears helicopter contaminated with NovichokBarack Obama endorses 81 Democratic candidates for the November mid-termsComment: What do the gender pay gap and Brexit have in common?

If we are serious about social mobility, then this barrier to education must be removed.”An estimated 120,000 children in the UK – many who have been living in Britain for most of their lives – are being charged these high fees to register their citizenship rights, the charity highlights.Recent analysis calculated that the\u0026nbspHome Office\u0026nbsphas made almost £100m in profit from\u0026nbspchildren registering as British citizens over the last five years.It came after The Independent revealed that the government had been accused of using UK-born children of immigrants as “cash cows” by charging extortionate sums for\u0026nbspcitizenship.Nicola Noble, head teacher at Surrey Square School, said: “Most of the children affected have lived in Britain their entire lives and now their parents – the majority of which are in low paid jobs – are forced to go to upsetting lengths to save for costly citizenship fees.“We see the impact of the Home Office’s fees on a daily basis. The need for food vouchers at our school has increased because parents are going without to save up extra money and some parents are working multiple jobs to scrape together enough funds for the citizenship application.”She added: “Many parents have been forced to take out loans and are getting into debt because they are so determined to secure citizenship for their children, to give them the possibility of going to university without paying huge foreign student fees.“It is deeply worrying that the Home Office is making a profit on the back of hard working families.”\u0026nbspSarah Holtam, co-chair of Citizens UK Council, said: “Not only are these fees are incredibly high, but that they are also much more expensive than anywhere else in the EU-15. We simply don’t understand why the Home Office is charging so much for citizenship given the harm it is doing to communities proudly living and working in Britain.”Daniel, a 15-year-old who has been in the UK since the age of three, was prevented from going on school trips and risks missing out on college because his mother could not afford to apply for citizenship.He previously told\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“It’s stopped me doing a lot of things. I felt like I was different from everyone else. You’d think me being British would be something that would come naturally as I’ve been here as long as I can remember. It’s been really limiting.”UK news in picturesDemonstrators against Tommy Robinson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the  former English Defence League leader has been freed on bail by the Court of Appeal after winning a challenge against a finding of contempt of courtFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

Food banks, faith groups and charitablevoluntary organisations are now being left to pick up the pieces where central government has failed.“Indeed, rather than fix the problem of child poverty, the government has instead attempted to redefine it. Of the services available, demand will clearly outstrip supply. It is shameful that the safety net is so threadbare.\u0026nbspThe government must take steps to tackle the issue of holiday hunger through properly funded and resourced programmes.Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimUN to investigate extreme poverty in the UK – after years of austerityMore than one in 10 households living in fuel poverty, figures showLabour to stop academies paying ‘poverty wages’ while bosses get £100kGiven the scale of the problem the government’s announcement of £2m additional funds to help disadvantaged children with food and fun over the holidays, while welcome, goes nowhere near far enough to tackle the desperate plight of families and children.”It comes after a previous NEU survey found malnourished children are stuffing their pockets with food as the numbers living in poverty grows.The survey found three in five (60 per cent) of school staff believed child poverty had worsened since 2015.\u0026nbspOf those, the vast majority (87 per cent) said it was having a significant impact on the learning of their pupils.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home. So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And they have isolated a range of planets that could have the same conditions, and where life might already have begun in the same way.Published in the journal Science Advances, the study suggests that if a star is giving off enough light, it could kickstart the beginnings of life itself. The UV light appears to power a series of chemical reactions that are central to the beginnings of life.And there are a range of planets that have just that amount of UV light, the researchers say. Many of them not only have the right kind of light but are also of the right temperature to ensure they have liquid water on their surface.Taken together, those planets could offer an important place to search for alien life.“This work allows us to narrow down the best places to search for life,” said Dr Paul Rimmer, a postdoctoral researcher and\u0026nbspthe paper’s lead author. “It brings us just a little bit closer to addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe.”The work relies on research done by\u0026nbspProfessor John Sutherland, which looked for the chemical origin of life on Earth. It found that it could have been helped by the poison cyanide – once that is formed, it is thought to interact with various parts of the environment including light from the sun, and create the chemicals required to make life begin.That was tested out by putting those chemicals under strong UV lights, where they generated the most basic ingredients of the chemicals needed for life.The new research drew on that work but looked at the exact kinds and strength of light that was required for such interactions.“I came across these earlier experiments, and as an astronomer, my first question is always what kind of light are you using, which as chemists they hadn’t really thought about,” said Dr\u0026nbspRimmer. “I started out measuring the number of photons emitted by their lamps, and then realised that comparing this light to the light of different stars was a straightforward next step.”Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But cooler stars do not seem to work, and so any planets where the interactions happen will need to have the right kind of stars.There are many planets that seem to fit that category, including several exoplanets found by the Kepler space telescope. Scientists expect to find many more candidates in the coming years, with the use of brand new space telescopes like Nasa’s newly launched Tess.It is possible that life might have developed on entirely different planets, in its own way, the researchers noted, but looking for life that began like it did on Earth is the most natural step.“I’m not sure how contingent life is, but given that we only have one example so far, it makes sense to look for places that are most like us,” said Dr\u0026nbspRimmer. “There’s an important distinction between what is necessary and what is sufficient. The building blocks are necessary, but they may not be sufficient: it’s possible you could mix them for billions of years and nothing happens. But you want to at least look at the places where the necessary things exist.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg","title":"great pyramid giza egypt electromagnetic energy radio chambers itmo university","story":"Created with Sketch.Revelation could have\u0026nbsptechnological applications such as creating effective solar cells, say researchersClick to followThe Independent OnlineGreat Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic energy through its hidden chambers, physicists revealThe Great Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic radiation into pockets of energy inside its network of internal chambers and underneath its base, a new study has suggested.Theoretical research by a team of Russian scientists aimed to understand how the pyramid would respond to radio waves directed at it, with the goal of recreating its shape at a nanoscale.But far from unveiling and harnessing some mystical property of the ancient structure, the scientists hope to use their findings in technological applications such as creating effective solar cells.Speculation about the supposed function of Egypt’s pyramids has been prevalent since at least the early 20th century, and the structures have been linked with everything from aliens to the apocalypse.As the oldest and largest of the Giza pyramids, the Great Pyramid constructed for Pharaoh Khufu thousands of years ago has\u0026nbspdrawn some of the wildest theories.In their paper, the scientists acknowledge that “these amazing structures excite the imagination of people engendering various fables and baseless assumptions”.This, they explain, is what makes it all the more important for scientists to use modern techniques to explore the real-life mysteries of the pyramids.They used mathematical models to understand how light would react with a hypothetical nanoparticle shaped like the ancient wonder of the world.“Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention,” said Dr Andrey Evlyukhin from ITMO University, one of the study’s authors.“We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.”\u0026nbspTheir research has been\u0026nbsppublished in the Journal of Applied Physics.Tombs of the pyramid builders discovered in Giza, EgyptImages courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)The scientists\u0026nbspfirst estimated that a so-called “resonant” state could be achieved in the pyramid using radio wave lengths ranging from 200m to 600m, meaning electromagnetic energy would be concentrated within and underneath the structure.“Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions,” said Dr Evlyukhin.“For example, we assumed that there are no unknown cavities inside, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid. With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications.”The team’s interest in the Great Pyramid was first roused while they were investigating the interaction between light and certain nanoparticles.Light can be controlled at a nanoscale by varying the size, shape and refractive index of the nanoparticles’ source materials.The Pyramids of Giza are near a Pizza Hut and more disappointmentsArchaeologists find 4,400-year-old tomb near pyramids outside CairoNow, the scientists want to find out if by creating nanoparticles shaped like the Great Pyramid, they can get them to interact with light in the same way it interacted with radio waves – concentrating its energy into specific areas.“Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,” said Dr Polina Kapitanova, another ITMO University physicist.This is not the first time the worlds of physics and pyramid research have collided.\u0026nbspIn a 2017 paper published in the journal Nature, scientists used particle physics techniques to discover a new chamber inside the Great Pyramid – the first to be revealed since the 19th century.\u0026nbspGreat Pyramid of GizaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/14/wildflower-meadow.jpg","title":"david attenborough big butterfly count meadow council devon","story":"Created with Sketch.Butterfly species previously spotted\u0026nbspthere include\u0026nbspholly blues, ringlets, commas, marbled whites, peacocks and painted ladiesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEast Devon District Council has apologised and said it would take measures to ensure it would not happen again next yearA council worker has mowed\u0026nbspa meadow being monitored for a wildlife project\u0026nbspspearheaded by\u0026nbspDavid Attenborough,\u0026nbspdestroying the wildflowers that grew there.The site, in Sidmouth\u0026nbspin Devon, was home to eight different species of butterfly surveyed as part of\u0026nbspthe Big Butterfly Count.But an\u0026nbspEast Devon District Council (EDDC) employee tasked with cutting a pathway from a car park\u0026nbspto the gate\u0026nbspaccidentally cut nine acres of the meadow.

The loss would be around £800 under a ‘no deal’ Brexit.”People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIt added: “These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses.”Pro-EU politicians seized on the conclusions as fresh evidence of the need for a fresh referendum on the Brexit deal – which The Independent is calling for\u0026nbspthrough its Final Say campaign.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “These figures make explicitly clear that people up and down the country will be worse off if the UK leaves the EU. That is the truth behind the cost of May’s Brexit.“No one voted to have less money in their pockets. No one deserves to be punished because of the mess created by the Conservatives.”Alison McGovern, a Labour supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “This crucial report demonstrates that it is very hard to see any upside to Brexit.Over 400,000 sign The Independent’s petition for second Brexit voteBusiness group says no to ‘no deal’ Brexit as firms face rising costsBrexit key dates: When is the UK leaving the EU?Ministers ‘misleading public’ over giant lorry park link to Brexit“What’s more, we know that those areas dominated by manufacturing will be worst off of all. And the national economic situation will rob Britain of the chance to invest in decent public services.”Meanwhile, in Vienna, Mr Hunt again claimed the EU would suffer if it failed to back the Chequers plan as a “pragmatic solution”.Speaking after his talks he said on Twitter: “We want the EU to prosper but there is a real risk of a messy orce which would be a geostrategic mistake.”And, having urged EU capitals to force Brussels to offer the UK better exit terms, he added: “Let’s not make this one of those moments where a terrible mistake is made which we are still talking about in 20 or 30 years.”The NIESR said the UK economy would grow by 1.4 per cent in 2018 and by 1.75 per cent in each succeeding year – but only if close to full access was retained.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/14/infact-universalbasicincome.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/14/infact-universalbasicincome.jpg","title":"labour universal basic income john mcdonnell party manifesto corbyn poverty social benefits","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive –\u0026nbspIn an interview with The Independent, the shadow chancellor said: \u0027I think it’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsLabour set to include pilot of radical basic income policy in next manifesto, John McDonnell saysLabour is set to include a plan for the radical policy of a universal basic income in its next manifesto for a general election, John McDonnell has told The Independent.The shadow chancellor – one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies in Westminster – said a Labour-commissioned review into the policy, which aims to transform the welfare state, is expected to be published in the autumn.The concept, which involves ditching the traditional means tested benefits and replacing them with an unconditional flat rate payment to all citizens, has been trialled in various parts of the world, including Finland and Canada.Labour loses overall control of Nuneaton council in blow for partyMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMcDonnell’s attempt to make nice with the City is a smart moveMcDonnell defends Corbyn’s response to Russia nerve agent attackMr McDonnell revealed he had recently discussed the idea with former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was “really keen” on getting a pilot of the scheme in the next manifesto.Asked whether he could envisage a pilot of basic income forming part of Labour’s next blueprint for government, he replied: “It’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try. There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”Last year, Mr McDonnell had told The Independent that Labour had set up a working group to investigate the feasibility of a basic income – led by one of his economic advisers, Guy Standing. During the height of the attempted coup against Mr Corbyn in 2016, the shadow chancellor also suggested he could “win the argument” on the idea within the Labour Party.In the\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent, Mr McDonnell continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”While the finer details of such a pilot are expected to be set out at a later date, a year long scheme involving 2,000 participants was launched in Finland in 2017 with each inidual receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.A poll last year by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath suggested that nearly half of all Britons (49 per cent) would back such a scheme and proponents include the prominent billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson.UK news in picturesDemonstrators against Tommy Robinson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the  former English Defence League leader has been freed on bail by the Court of Appeal after winning a challenge against a finding of contempt of courtFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

I thought we had got to a position where we are able to move on – we’re not – we’ve got to resolve that by September.“The discussion is taking place I think that will enable that to happen.”\u0026nbspPressed for his thoughts on a demonstration earlier this year in Parliament Square, in which hundreds of Jewish people gathered to demand the Labour leader tackle antisemitism in the party, Mr McDonnell said it was “deeply, deeply upsetting”.“I can’t tell you how upsetting it was,” he added. “It really cut you to the core, it really did. You have work these things through.”He continued: “The issue for me is that it’s upsetting but partly because you think how have we got ourselves in this situation, we’ve got to get this sorted it out but also in the life experiences of members of the Jewish community, while we have these disputes going on in the media and elsewhere, there isn’t sufficient campaigning on the ground to tackle those.“You just want to get on with the job of tackling antisemitism – what we should be doing now and I hope we can do is working in inidual communities identifying where the peaks are in terms of the antisemitic incidents, working with the community about how we tackle those that includes working with the police.”On Brexit, he added that there will “almost certainly” be a debate on Brexit at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool this September after the issue had been raised at union conferences and Constituency Labour Party meetings across the country.“There will be a range of policy debates and Brexit is bound to be one of them,” he said. “There’s bound to be debate this year.When pressed on the prospect of a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal – something Labour has consistently refused to rule out – Mr McDonnell said that while the party is “always up for some form of democratic engagement” his preference would be for a general election.“My view is that they should just move over and let us start the negotiations. If they are not willing to do that – general election and let’s decide.”On Labour’s failure to explicitly rule out a fresh referendum, he explained: “Why not? It’s not our policy, it’s not our policy and the worry I have, if you look at the opinion polls, split down the middle still – absolutely split. There’s been movement either way. My worry is that if you go for another referendum we could have an equally spilt vote and ide the country all over again.”Mr McDonnell added that his greatest fear with a second vote would be the “rise of the xenophobic right”, adding: “We’ve already seen that on the Tommy Robinson marches, which has been on a scale that has shocked people and certainly surprised people.“I think there’s a real problem,” he said. “It could be really dangerous if you split the country again and allow that xenophobic right to exploit the issue again. That’s why I’d rather we had a general election and again – as I say – in a general election you’re debating all the issues but you’re also choosing the team who will then go and negotiate.”In the coming months Mr McDonnell said he will be doing what has been promised as an anti-austerity tour of the country in areas he believes the party should have won at the previous election and regions where the party could win next time round. And as part of the Labour’s preparations for the ultimate goal of holding office, he said a Queen’s Speech, linked to a first Budget, was also being planned.But when asked whether he thought the public viewed him as Chancellor-in-waiting, he replied: “You know, I don’t think the public know who I am. We’ve done some polling, as you do, and drilled down into the polling about who knows who. Philip Hammond and myself are hardly recognised – we’re on the same par.“For me, I’m not bothered about personal recognition, it’s whether they understand our policies.“I’m not bothered whether the general public recognise me – we’re not into personality politics. It’s the Tony Benn thing: policies rather personalities. What I am more interested in is making sure people understand our policies, support them, and also we can convince them we have the capability to deliver. In some ways that means being seen as a team overall.He said it’s “not about do I get recognised in the street”, but added: “I do a lot.

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/997210_1.jpg","title":"brexit news france macron jeremy hunt brexit deal transition period EU","story":"Emmanuel Macron\u0026rsquos government has become the fiercest opponent of London within the EU by constantly vetoing any British proposals for the Brexit deal.In fact Paris was the most critical towards Theresa May\u0026rsquos white paper, which put forward a soft Brexit expected to please the EU.But this hardline stance, which aims at poaching businesses and markets from the UK, is leaving France \u0026ldquoisolated within the EU27.An EU diplomat who asked to remain anonymous told The Sun: Not every member state has the same position on everything, especially Brexit.\u0026nbsp                Boris Johnson beats Rees-Mogg as FAVOURITE to be next Tory leader                WARNING TO MERKEL: Change Barnier\u0027s mind on Brexit or Germany will ...There\u0027s one country that\u0027s very hard on the British and that\u0027s France.\u0026ldquoFrance is a little bit isolated in its opinion.They\u0027re the toughest but I don\u0027t know why because the French have much more interest in Brexit than others.This revelation comes as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has appealed to France and Germany to make the European Commission strike a \u0026ldquosensible trade deal with London and avoid a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Emmanuel Macron faces EU backlash over France\u0027s attitude on UK (Image: )According to the newly-appointed minister, the possibilities the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal are \u0026ldquoincreasing by the day.Such an outcome would cause job losses across the whole continent and hit EU businesses based in the City of London, he argued.He told the Evening Standard: \u0026ldquoThe probability of No Deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink.\u0026ldquoThat is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation.\u0026ldquoThere is real chance of No Deal by accident.

And it is very rare to find one that contains inclusions.Rare blue diamonds are famed for their vivid colour (Image: )The analysis showed that blue diamonds were created at least as deep as the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, between 410 and 660 kilometres (254.7-410 miles) below the Earth\u0027s surface.Several stones contained evidence of an even deeper origin below 660 kilometres.Most other diamonds form at between 150 and 200 kilometres.How the blue-tinting boron became incorporated into the gems is still a mystery.One theory is that it combined with water-rich minerals on the ocean floor and was carried far down into the Earth\u0027s mantle by sliding tectonic plates.The research is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/590x/Kepler-452b-997549.jpg","title":"planet life earth cousin","story":"A planet 1,400 light years away really could harbour life, say British scientists (Image: NC)Nicknamed \u0027Earth\u0027s cousin\u0027 it gets just the right amount of light from its sun for the chemical building blocks of life to develop, according to new research.The breakthrough improves the chances of astronomers eventually discovering extra-terrestrials.Known as Kepler-452b it\u0027s the smallest world discovered orbiting in the habitable zone of a star.What makes the planet even more remarkable is the distance is about the same as that of Earth\u0027s from the sun. Both stars also seem similar.Now a Cambridge University team has discovered stars around the same temperature as our\u0027s emit enough light for the building blocks of life to form on the surface.Cool stars, on the other hand, do not produce enough light for these lipids, amino acids and nucleotides to turn into living cells.Planets like Kepler-452b reside in what the researchers have called the \u0027abiogenesis zone\u0027 - receiving enough light to activate the chemistry and being able to have liquid water.Unfortunately it lies too far away to probe with current technology.But NASA\u0027s latest TESS and James Webb Telescopes could identify many more planets that possess these properties.Of course, it is also possible that if there is life on other planets, that it has or will develop in a totally different way than it did on Earth.                Elon Musk net worth: How did Elon Musk make his money? Net worth?                Elon Musk fires back at NASA: Mars CAN be conqueredFirst author Dr Paul Rimmer said: I\u0027m not sure how contingent life is, but given that we only have one example so far, it makes sense to look for places that are most like us.There\u0027s an important distinction between what is necessary and what is sufficient.The building blocks are necessary, but they may not be sufficient.It\u0027s possible you could mix them for billions of years and nothing happens.But you want to at least look at the places where the necessary things exist.The study, published in the journal Science Advances, found the chances for life to develop on a rocky planet are linked to the strength of UV (ultraviolet) light given off by its star.On Earth for instance the sun powers a series of chemical reactions that produce the building blocks of life.Dr Rimmer said: This work allows us to narrow down the best places to search for life.It brings us just a little bit closer to addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe.It builds on the work of co-author Professor John Sutherland who suggested three years ago that deadly cyanide was a key ingredient in the primordial soup from which all life on Earth originated.The breakthrough improves the chances of astronomers eventually discovering extra-terrestrials (Image: NASA)The researchers performed a series of experiments to measure how quickly the building blocks of life can be formed from hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulphite under UV light and in the dark.Senior author Professor Didier Queloz, of Cambridge University, said: There is chemistry that happens in the dark.It\u0027s slower than the chemistry that happens in the light - but it\u0027s there. We wanted to see how much light it would take for the light chemistry to win out over the dark chemistry.In the dark an inert compound developed. The building blocks of life did not form. But in the scenario under lights they did..According to recent estimates there are as many as 700 million trillion terrestrial planets in the observable universe.Prof Sutherland, of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB), said: Getting some idea of what fraction have been, or might be, primed for life fascinates me.Of course, being primed for life is not everything and we still don\u0027t know how likely the origin of life is, even given favourable circumstances - if it\u0027s really unlikely then we might be alone, but if not, we may have company.Nasa has said Kepler-452b - also dubbed \u0027Earth 2.0\u0027 - has a substantial opportunity to host life.If plants were transferred there they would likely survive.The planet is 60 per cent larger in diameter than Earth and is 1,400 light years away in the constellation Cygnus.It is about 1.5 billion years older than Earth - and could be just as rocky."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/995524_1.jpg","title":"Labour news Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell Universal Basic Income trial","story":"A universal basic universal income means every adult in the country would receive money from the Government, regardless of whether they work, funded by taxation.Mr McDonnell said a UBI trial program is \u0026ldquoone of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto.Speaking to The Independent, he added: \u0026ldquoIt will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto - that\u0026rsquos one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.\u0026ldquoThere have been pilots elsewhere.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of it is common sense.It makes no sense that ferry or rail passengers don’t have to give the same basic info to the Authorities as plane arrivals do.It should go without saying that failed asylum seekers should be sent home quickly, without endless costly judicial reviews at taxpayers’ expense.And to avoid another Windrush scandal we must give official papers to those who have been here for years — especially Ugandan Asians, who came in the ’70s and are most likely to be without. Other recommendations require a bit more thought.But at least Policy Exchange are doing some thinking about Britain’s future. On the other hand, the Government is turning drift into an art form.  Even the much-ballyhoed, super-charged no deal plans that were supposed to be released one-by-one this summer are being quietly shuffled away until one day in late August.Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is right to be “alarmed and worried” .The PM’s Chequers fudge is a direct result of our lack of planning, and until we’re ready to go it alone, Brussels will force us to make more concessions. We must see Brexit as an opportunity, and take full advantage.But the clock is ticking.OUR probe into hospital admissions due to knife crime is simply shocking.It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the police are losing control.The new Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has introduced a Bill to Parliament that will see some of the worst weapons taken off the streets.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism. Jezza even risks losing his beloved allotment in Jewish-voting Barnet.What will it now take for decent Labour MPs like Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper to admit Labour is not fit under Corbyn to be an alternative party of government?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In that same period, I didn’t see a single police officer.Since Spice, once a legal high, was made illegal in 2016, its miserable hold on vulnerable people such as street sleepers and prisoners has not weakened up and down the country. At less than £5 a gram - enough for a few hours’ fix - it’s cheap and accessible.The zombie drug, so-called because users often stagger around looking like the living dead, is a particular problem in Manchester and police here say they’ve received 1,300 calls relating to the drug in 18 months.And earlier in the summer, visitors to Piccadilly Gardens - a hugely popular main square in the city centre - were appalled to see a couple, allegedly high on Spice, having sex in broad daylight.The charity Lifeshare estimates that 95 per cent of Manchester’s homeless people take the drug and several users have been hospitalised after taking it.It is highly addictive, with withdrawal symptoms said to be worse than coming off crack or heroin. Users can suffer vomiting, seizures, hallucinations and psychosis. Stocks of the drug are believed to flood into the country through Eastern Europe, having come initially from China.Particularly strong strains are being sold in Manchester compared to elsewhere, which is why spice addicts flock to the city on the Spice Trail, named-so to mimic the historic East-West trade of spices.And the scale of the problem is much in evidence on an ordinary Monday in the city centre. Yards away, just beyond the stench of urine and the sight of Spice being smoked openly on the grass by an emaciated homeless woman with a baby in a buggy, excited children are playing in the fountains.The Spice-smoking mother, no older than 16, has one hand on the pram and a roll-up in the other as she chats and giggles with a toothless man in shorts and nothing else. It’s shocking that illegal drug users are staggering, hallucinating and catatonic so close to innocent kids playing, according to worried mum Angela, 37, from nearby Ancoats.“Where are the police? Angela asks. Two of her children are running together through the fountains, while her third is in her arms. I bring my three small kids here – they’re seven, five and nine months - for a nice day out, only to see Spice users being sick everywhere, running through the fountains all Spiced-up so I have to take the kids away until they’re gone away. “My three are terrified of them. It makes me not want to bring them here. There should be a restriction so the Spice guys can’t come here where the kids are.” Spice user Jed who’s sitting on the steps beneath the Queen Victoria monument, sees it differently.“I’ve got nothing, absolutely nothing, and nowhere to go, he says. I’ve as much right to be here as anyone else.Yes I take Spice, but who wouldn’t if they were living my life? It makes me feel good, it puts me to sleep, it blocks stuff out. It passes the time, and I have a lot of that.”He’s been living on the streets for 20 years, since he was 16, after a chaotic childhood with alcoholic parents and siblings. He looks 20 years older than he is: craggy, pallid and caked in dirt. Most of his teeth are missing and his jogging bottoms smell of urine.He says he started taking Spice when he was in prison for burglary and assault a year ago.“All I own in this world is a sleeping bag, I sleep wherever, usually in shop doorways where the CCTV cameras are. I’ve got four kids so if anything happens to me, the camera won’t lie. I smoke an ounce of Spice a day. That costs me £40. I go nicking to get the money I need. I do some shoplifting.”Jed talks freely for a while but starts scratching himself manically and becomes aggressive, eventually storming off for no apparent reason. Hours later, I see him slumped unconscious on one of the benches opposite McDonald’s.The buyers and sellers of Spice clutter a pavement where customers, often oblivious, are in and out of Debenhams, Halifax, Starbucks and Morrisons. They congregate round the two monuments in the gardens: a strutting dealer aged around 30, dressed head-to-toe in Adidas, a giggling guy in his 20s dancing with his jeans pulled down below his bottom an angry blonde 30-something woman shouting odds at a woman of the same age, slumped double beside a stained duvet. It’s hardly the ideal lunch break setting for people working close by, as three 19-year-old college students explain.“We’ve just had to move away from the monument over there because of the zombies lying round us and the dealers shouting out,” Jess says.“A big, topless, wasted guy was hassling us for money, so we thought it would be safer to move to where all the kids and their parents are. Not nice. We all felt intimidated over there.”A young couple, Grace and Matthew, who have just finished school, say that they often see people asking for money outside McDonalds.A middle-aged woman, Alison, from the Channel Islands, says: “This is my first time in Manchester for 20 years and I’m shocked by what I’m seeing. It’s like watching a horrible documentary about drug taking, but it’s real life and it’s happening 10ft from where I’m sitting on a bench waiting for my daughter to finish a college interview.“I’m angry that there are no police here, and sad for the mess these poor people have got themselves into. What a waste of their lives.”For the many shops and eateries bordering Piccadilly Gardens, Spice is bad for business. Spaced-out druggies, often aggressive, sometimes hallucinating, are off-putting.Lucas, the supervisor in a nearby restaurant, says: “They come in here wanting to use the toilet. One guy came in totally wasted on Spice and fell on the floor in the restaurant and started shaking.We called an ambulance, but when it came he just stood up and walked out.“The Deliveroo and Just Eat drivers don’t want to come here because they can get their bikes stolen when they’re picking up food. Some customers tell us they won’t come into the city centre after 5pm.”A security guard standing outside a café says: “Spice is a massive problem here and it’s a shame that a park that’s at the heart of Manchester is ruined by users. I know the police use Dispersal Orders but that only tends to get rid of them for 48 hours, then they’re straight back.”A store security guard who didn’t want to be named described the Spice problem as a nightmare which fuels shoplifting and puts customers off shopping.“You think someone is dead, they’re so out of their head, but five minutes later you see them begging on the McDonald’s wall, and so it goes on, day after day. Very troubling.”The manager at a hairdressing salon on Tib Street says he’s concerned about the fire hazard caused by street sleepers bedding down in shop doorways with carrier bags, sleeping bags and duvets. Last year the evening newspaper here described Piccadilly Gardens as a dystopian scene of seemingly unending human misery.An impassioned article continued: “This has not happened overnight. That human beings are rotting away in our busiest public square has been evident for a long time. It is a sight that should shame Manchester.”“Tackling spice use and dealing in the city centre is still a high priority for us and we continue to work with our partners to help people get the support that they need and ultimately get this harmful drug off our streets.“Enforcement action has seen us tackle dealers and use intelligence to target organised crime gangs across Greater Manchester - 55 people have been arrested for possession with intent to supply spice since January 2017 in the city centre alone.In addition to this we have also arrested 90 others for being in possession of the drug, with many of these people directed to support services.“It’s crucial that we continue to work with partners, including Manchester City Council’s Antisocial Behaviour Action Team, the CPS and the courts to take dealers off the streets but also with health and support services to refer users to that they can get the help that they need and ultimately help us tackle the issue.“We remain committed to working together to keep Manchester safe for everyone, but we do need the continued support of the community in reporting suspicious incidents through 101, or 999 in an emergency.”Big Issue seller Charlie, 46, is sitting with his dog Monty outside the H\u0026ampM store on Market Street. Charlie has been homeless, on and off, since he was 13, though he recently qualified as a plasterer and now has a flat in Stockport. He says: “I’ve never touched Spice, it’s an idiot’s game, but the problem here in Manchester hasn’t happened overnight – the authorities are just ignoring it. “Spice is giving Manchester a dreadful name. It needs sorting out. That horrible corner of Piccadilly Gardens is like Skid Row.”Back there, Spice business remains brisk. On the hottest afternoon of the year, a woman is comatose in a phone box underneath a duvet. There’s a loud argument going on between two shouting women, both of them emaciated, and four men are unconscious on benches.It’s as depressing a snapshot of life on the streets in 21st century Britain as one could see.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

(Answers at the foot of the page).Big Narstie, who began his chat show run by announcing: “First things first, I just want to say ‘Channel 4, you f***ed up’.”And he really wasn’t kidding.WANT to know what it’s like to be a cocker spaniel, locked in a Nissan Micra for two hours on Southend ­seafront? Try watching BBC2’s Stewart Lee: Content Provider, which was recorded live at the town’sPalace Theatre, in April. You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well. Stupid f***ing c***s.”Good luck selling out the O2, Stew.Mystery objects round, as described by Stacey Solomon’s son Zachary: “They’re louder than like a car beeping. They’re very annoying.

All gappy leers, awkward silences and ill-fitting brown suits, this lot were. My word, though, after the briefest of mobile phone interruptions, the sexual chemistry was fair zinging between Annabel Giles and her first date.“Was that your mum?”“No, my mum is dead.”“I’m probably the same age as your mum. How old is she?” She’s still dead, Annabel.If anything though, romantic developments were even less promising back at the girls’ villa on Naxos, where we learnt: “A goat escaped its pen and spent the night in Ingrid Tarrant’s room. There’s poo everywhere.”Whether the poo belonged to the goat or Ingrid, I’m still not 100 per cent sure, but I’m hoping the local match-maker flagged up “a potential bowel issue” with her first date, George, an absolute ringer forHarvey Weinstein, whose background caused a surprising amount of excitement.“He lives in Crete,” Ingrid squealed down the phone to her daughter.“So do they call them Cretins?” Only if he asks for a second date, Ingrid (ITV, Thursday, 9pm).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities?

In separate bathrooms, they sit on the toilet crying, trying to close the door on him as he continues to hold the camera on them.While this particular video has been removed, others remain, where he cuts their hair and pretends to feed them dog faeces.In one rather brutal video he sets off fireworks in their room as they sleep.As his children start crying, Brady laughs, saying “it’s a prank because they think somebody was shooting!”In “drowning baby prank” he pretends to his partner, Royalty, that her infant daughter has died in the pool. As she comes running out the house, Brady shouts: “It’s a prank, sucker!”In another clip he destroys his son’s beloved PlayStation 3.The gaming console was eventually replaced with a PlayStation 4, but not before the child had a violent meltdown in his bedroom, lashing out at his sister who was in on the joke.Proving that nothing is sacred or private, he also posted a video of his wife Royalty’s miscarriage. The clip shows her devastated and barely conscious in a hospital bed after surgery.In an interview with babe, a child abuse expert condemned Brady’s channel as “horrific.”Dr Kortney Peagram, founder of Bulldog Solution, an anti-child abuse organisation, said: “harming your child on purpose with laxatives is child abuse. That’s child endangerment.”She added: “That [Brady is] harming his children and bullying them to pull pranks on each other is really disturbing.“He’s modelling inappropriate behaviour and encouraging it by laughter … He’s teaching his children that it’s OK to harm each other for a good laugh.”Following the babe.net article, YouTube released a statements, saying “content that endangers minors is unacceptable to us and we have strict policies prohibiting child endangerment and harmful and dangerous content. We remove content that violates our policies as soon as we’re made aware of it.”A version of this story first appeared on news.au"},{"url":null,"title":"funny texts messages grandparents phones","story":"However as these hilarious pictures show, grandparents and technology are not in this group.While grandparents are great at loads of things, sometimes keeping up with the latest technology isnt one of them.Confused relatives have delighted the internet by sharing pictures of their grandparents hilarious technology fails.From sending accidental texts to misusing emojis these pictures will make you laugh and cringe.They also show elderly people still have a sharp sense of humour."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/VP-MUZZED-PARKING.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"parking crusader","story":"It’s a bold statement – but then 43-year-old Sue is waging a one woman war against parking fines of any kind.Most evenings, when the rest of us are settling down in front of the telly, Sue is in the kitchen of her Cardiff home, poring over parking paperwork.Whether shes writing a strongly-worded letter pointing out a legal loophole - or spending a day in court defending strangers who are disputing fines, Sue will do everything in her power to stop people paying pesky fines.And the vigilante - who features in a new Channel 5 documentary airing tonight, Britains Parking Hell - has helped up to a thousand people escape paying parking fines with her British bulldog determination.Of the hundreds of court cases she’s got involved with, she has only lost once, saving the British public thousands and stopping money going to parking companies.I’ve got big balls and I’m holding these people to account, she declares.What they are doing is not right  - it’s disgusting and it’s quite possibly illegal.Theres a parking fine endemic in the UK - with eight million penalties issued here by council wardens every year - and an additional two and a half million from private parking companies.It’s these latter in particular that Sue has firmly fixed in her sights.I want to cut the legs out from under them, she says.They are predators and they are bullies as all they are concerned with is how much money they can make as quickly as possible by intimidating decent genuine people.Sue’s crusade started a few years ago during a difficult time in which two of her three children were hospitalised.A stressed-out single mum, she didn’t always have time to pay the exact parking charges at the hospital, and was issued with frequent tickets.Life was very stressful and what made it even more so was that I was frequently getting parking tickets from the hospital car park, she recalls.Every time a letter popped through the door it made my stomach churn with anxiety.Researching online, she came across a Facebook page set up by a local pensioner to help people in a similar predicament.As I was scrolling through I could see their were hundreds in my position, she explains.The absolute fear people felt made me sick.Many people were on the breadline but being issued with fines for £100 which they couldn’t remotely afford.I just got angry that people could be made to feel like that. It’s not right.So I offered to step in and help and I ended up taking over the group.She started to do her research and found that many of us are labouring under a basic misapprehension.Half of these parking fines aren’t worth the paper they are written on, she says.They’re not even fines. Only the police and councils can issue those  – what private parking companies issue are invoices for an alleged debt – and that debt is not proven until they have gone to court.So a lot of it is speculative. They say you’ve done something – I say prove it.And in most cases, she believes, they can’t.Supermarket car parks are a case in point – people often get fined as they have punched the wrong registration in to the machine, or they are in a rush and haven’t bothered to officially record that they are parking, she says.But they are still doing their shopping so there is no financial loss. The parking companies are just trying it on. It’s bullying.Bullying is a word that crops up time and again.I’ve had people get in touch who have complied and put their details in but they have still issued the tickets as they bank on people being too intimidated not to pay, adds Sue.I had one woman who had a letter threatening court when she hadn’t paid a ticket.She panicked and stumped up £160 and they still issued a court claim which is going to court next month. It’s bullying plain and simple.And Sue believes her experience shows that like many bullies they often back down if you stand up to them.It’s very rare they back down at the first appeal, but by the second appeal they usually cave – they don’t want to spend the money and time on the admin.Another bugbear of Sue’s is the plight facing the increasing number of Brits who lease their cars.If you lease your vehicle and get a parking the fine gets sent directly to the leasing company who pays it off immediately, denying the customer the opportunity to appeal, she says.Then on top of that they pass on their administrative costs to you so before you know it you’ve got a £60 or £120 fine with up to £50 slapped on top for the paperwork.In the show, we meet Daniel, known as The Terminator- Weston-Super-Mares most-feared parking warden.His frequently repeated motto is I can tell you where not to park, I cant tell you where to park, - showing the parking crisis is even felt by those who hand out fines.In another parking dispute - a man now nicknamed the Tulk from Luton, saw a neighbour had parked across his aunts drive and refused to move, so he picked up the offending vehicle and rolled it away.Since a clip of his heroic strength emerged online, hes been flooded with requests from angry residents all over the country.Of course, there are times when fines – or invoices – are legitimate.Most of the time though, Sue believes, greedy private companies are exploiting people.The majority of people are not abusing facilities – it’s people who have gone to hospital to see a loved one and don’t read the signs properly in a blind panic.She tells Sun Online about a woman with a terminally-ill husband who took him to the beach to see his last sunset who got a ticket - stories like these that fuel her crusade.Today Sue’s Facebook group has more than 2,000 followers, a number which is growing by the day - yet she admits that her family and friends are baffled by her obsession.My friends think I’m mad, and my mother and sister think I should ditch this and focus on my life with my kids but I just can’t bear to see people suffering, she says.I’ll just carry on what I’m doing and helping as many people as I can who have unfair tickets.Britain’s Parking Hell, is on Channel 5, 8pm tonightOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Shetland document claims that under a \"no deal\", 86% of sheep farms are expected to be loss-making, compared to half under current arrangements.The increase in losses arises out of the imposition of tariffs on lamb exports to Europe.Almost all councils expressed significant concerns about how the treasury will replace crucial EU structural and regional funds - particularly now the PM has promised any money that might materialise after Brexit to the NHS.But another common feature in the reports is exasperation that councils just do not know what to plan for as they wait for the government to agree a deal.  Some councils said impact assessments were impossible until the government firms up its position.Wirral council, for example, told Sky News: \"Given the lack of detail from government about any proposed deal or arrangements, it is difficult to carry out an assessment that is not purely speculative at this time.\"It did however say once \"firm details\" of any deal were available it would produce an analysis including \"wider general implications for residents such as food costs.\"The government is pondering when to release its own preparedness notices for Brexit.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis.And she\u0027s not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year\u0027s series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show.American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: \"@LoveIsland Jack \u0026 Dani are goals! 😍 #LoveIsland\". There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they\u0027re not real, but it doesn\u0027t matter.\"Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl\u0027s mates.\"It\u0027s on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch.

Mr McDonnell presented a motion in the House of Commons to suggest it should be renamed “Genocide Memorial Day - Never Again For Anyone”. Mr Corbyn, along with three other Labour MPs and Tory MP Peter Bottomley, co-sponsored the motion. Early Day Motions are the Commons equivalent of a petition, a chance for MPs to put on record how they feel about issues of the day. It was tabled on January 27 2011, Holocaust Memorial Day. Politics Home first drew attention to the motion, which called for the definition to be expanded to include the victims of other genocides and their families. It also notes that the Nazis did not only target Jewish people, but also the disabled and Roma, Jehova\u0027s Witnesses, lesbian, gay and bisexual people and others they deemed undesirables.  And it calls on the House of Commons to welcome the Never Again For Anyone initiative, an apparent reference to a campaign promoted by the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN). On its website, the IJAN claims the initiative is intended to challenge the zionist exploitation of the Holocaust for political purposes. It goes on: By exceptionalizing the Nazi genocide, European Jews are set apart from the victims and survivors of that and other genocides instead of being united with them. The Zionist exploitation of this genocide to justify colonization, displacement and apartheid in Palestine is a dishonor to those who survived and those who did not.  A Labour Party spokesman, speaking on behalf of both Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell said: “This was a cross party initiative, jointly sponsored by a senior Conservative MP, to emphasise the already broader character of Holocaust Memorial Day.  “It is not our policy to seek a name change for this important commemoration.” That this House welcomes the Never Again For Anyone Initiative by survivors and descendants of survivors of genocides, which declares that every life is of value  notes that disabled people were the first victims of Nazi mass murder, that working class activists and trade unionists, many of whom were Jewish, were the first to be sent to concentration camps, and that Nazism targeted not only Jewish but also Roma, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, lesbian, gay and bisexual people and others they deemed undesirables  and therefore supports the call for international awareness of all communities and countries who have suffered and resisted mass extermination by renaming Holocaust Memorial Day as Genocide Memorial Day - Never Again For Anyone.” Mr Corbyn apologised today for hosting an event held in Parliament on Holocaust Memorial day the previous year, 2010, organised as part of the same Never Again For Anyone campaign. The star speaker at the event had compared the Israeli government to the Nazis. Mr Corbyn said he was sorry for concerns and anxiety after hosting the talk. The main speaker was Hajo Meyer, a passionate anti-Zionist who survived the Auschwitz Nazi death camp and railed against the actions of the Israeli government.

Jenny McCullough claimed Mr Vaz repeatedly bullied her and undermined her position while he was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, according to an investigation by BBC Newsnight. Mr Vaz denies the claims. Mr Vaz quit his role as chair of the Committee after the Mirror revealed he had hired prostitutes and suggested he was willing to pay for drugs. One alleged incident took place during an official Committee visit to Russia and Ukraine in 2008. Ms McCullough voiced concerns about whether a dinner attended by Mr Vaz had been arranged in compliance with Parliamentary rules.  Emails obtained by Newsnight show she was worried about who was paying for the dinner. “The chairman refused to tell me who we would be meeting or what the arrangements were beyond that we would be dining with Ivan, a friend of his who was (or used to be, I couldn\u0027t find out) a \u0027senator\u0027, she wrote. But, she said when she arrived at the event it was an “opulent” dinner thrown in Mr Vaz’s honour, and she did not know who the guests were. She emailed her manager to say the group did not pay, and did not know who did. When Ms McCullough confronted Mr Vaz over her concerns, she claimed, he launched into a “tirade” in a hotel lobby. She claimed: “He then demanded to know what age I was. He told me that I didn\u0027t know how the House worked and that I didn\u0027t respect the authority of members - that I had an attitude problem.

The social network has banned 32 pages and accounts from Facebook and Instagram as part of its effort to combat foreign meddling in US elections.  The campaign was targeted at voters ahead of November’s US congressional elections. Facebook stopped short of naming the source of the misinformation. But members of Congress briefed by Facebook on the matter said the methodology of the influence campaign suggested Russian involvement. “I can say I think with pretty high confidence I think this is Russian-related,” Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Two U.S. intelligence officials said there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Russia was behind the Facebook campaign, but one noted that “the similarities, aims and methodology relative to the 2016 Russian campaign are quite striking.  A Russian propaganda arm tried to tamper in the 2016 U.S. election by posting and buying ads on Facebook. In February, the U.S. Justice Department indicted 13 Russian nationals, and the St. Petersburg-based ‘troll factory’ known as the Internet Research Agency, for interfering in the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow has denied involvement. Facebook has been on the defensive about influence activity on its site and concerns over user privacy tied to long-standing agreements with developers that allowed them access to private user data. The Atlantic Council\u0027s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which was shown the suspended pages ahead of the takedown, said they showed similarities in language and approach to previously fake accounts from the Internet Research Agency, which is known as the “troll factory” because it stirs up public opinion on social media sites. The lab cited “consistent mistranslation, as well as an overwhelming focus on polarizing issues at the top of any given news cycle.” It said, for example, the posts on the year-old, feminist Resisters page “took a liberal or left-wing stance on issues around gender, race, immigration, and human rights.” Other pages promoted racial pride among minority groups.  Russians charged with US election meddling branded information warfare - including paying someone to dress as Hillary Clinton in prison  The group said the Resisters page was alarming because it was pushing for confrontation at multiple protests, including against Unite the Right 2, with a potential for violence. “Unite the Right” was the name of the march in Charlottesville, Virginia, which saw white supremacists and neo-Nazis take to the streets chanting “Jews will not replace us.” The rally descended into violence, and the death of counter protester Heather Heyer in a vehicle ramming attack.  President Trump did not denounce white nationalists explicitly in his response, instead condemning “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” A follow-up march is due to take place in Washington DC next week. A man who identified himself as an administrator of Resisters, Washington activist Brendan Orsinger, said on a video call with Reuters that he had been invited to help operate the page by someone he knew only through Facebook messages. I definitely had concerns, because people don\u0027t usually invite me to accounts unless they know me, Orsinger said. But at the same time, this was an account we could use. He said that more than a dozen legitimate activist groups were still supporting the counter-rally and would now have to work harder to reconnect with people who had been following it through the Resisters page. Orsinger said he was not yet sure that the account that had involved him was Russian, but that if it was, he was concerned about he and fellow activists being infiltrated and influenced. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u0027s chief operating officer, said on a call with reporters that the attempts to manipulate public opinion would likely become more sophisticated to evade Facebook\u0027s scrutiny, calling it an arms race.  The White House said the administration was supportive of Facebook\u0027s actions. We applaud efforts by our private-sector partners to combat an array of threats that occur in cyberspace, including malign influence, said Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council. U.S. President Donald Trump has come under fire for discounting the threat of interference in the congressional elections.  During his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki earlier this month, Trump appeared to state that he believed Russia was no longer trying to influence the U.S. election process.  Trump later amended that, saying he was very concerned about Russian interference in the election. On Friday, Trump held a meeting with his national security advisers on election security. Facebook identified influence activity around at least two issues, including the counter-protest to the Unite the Right 2 rally set next week in Washington. The other was the AbolishICE social media campaign aimed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Byron Davies became the Government’s General Aviation Champion - a role which pays \u0026pound350 a day after being defeated by Labour at the last election. The lucrative post was not advertised and there appear to have been no other applicants. The Government released details of the appointment in February announcing that they had created the post “help identify a network of UK aerodromes that are most important for non-scheduled flying to flourish”. A Freedom of Information request revealed the post-holder can rake in more than \u0026pound8,000 for just 2 days work a month.  The official response from the Cabinet Office explained that the role did not need to be advertised. It said “the appointment fell outside the formal appointment rules set out by Cabinet Office because it was a time limited one-off appointment” so it did not have to be advertised. Mr Davies, lost his seat last summer in an upset by Labour’s Tonia Antoniazzi who turned the Tories’ 27-vote majority into a more than 3,000 vote lead.

Vikings and former EastEnders star Ivan Kaye said he was forced out of his \u0026pound850,000 flat by the frighteningly angry behaviour of writer, Amanda Lees. Ms Lees, 54, constantly banged on the ceiling of her west London flat and screamed at him and abused his tenants in a terrifying vendetta, said the actor. She also allowed her front garden to grow so monstrously out of control that it blocked the light into his first floor window, he said. Now, after Judge Richard Roberts accepted Mr Kaye\u0027s claims, Ms Lees is facing a compensation bill for up to \u0026pound1 million for what she did. The judge said Ms Lees should have known she was harassing her neighbour and, in letting her garden grow so wild, causing him a nuisance. I find that the aforementioned acts have caused Mr Kaye alarm and distress.....and amounted to a course of conduct which amounted to harassment..., said the judge.  Mr Kaye, 57, told Central London County Court he knew Ms Lees had concerns over noise when he bought the flat above hers, in Ravenscourt Park, in 2013. He did his best to lift her concerns by organising a meeting when he moved in, but she refused to open her door when he arrived, he said. What followed was a long campaign of harassment - which the actor called a vendetta - against him, he said. She shouted and screamed at the slightest noise and even complained to police when he had friends around. In his evidence, Mr Kaye said he had struggled on, but Ms Lees\u0027 shouting and screaming sounded like someone was being murdered. He said he and Ms Lees had enjoyed a drink at his flat one evening, but that days later she blanked him in the corridor and later called police, blaming him for noise. His partner, Beatrix Archer, said: No matter how quietly we moved about the house, she banged, sent emails and threats, yelling constantly. Soon we spent the whole time upstairs, whispering and imprisoned.  Mr Kaye - who plays King Aelle in Vikings and was Dr Johnathan Leroy in EastEnders - said he resorted to camping out on the upper floor of his maisonette with the television, before eventually moving out and renting the flat to students. But Ms Lees\u0027 behaviour continued as soon as his tenants - a group of young undergraduates - moved in, the court heard. Alexandra Skinner, who was a 19-year-old when she moved into the flat, said it had left her and her flatmates crying on the phone to their mothers. The banging and shouting continued every single day, she told the judge. We spent the whole time in fear and Ms Lees\u0027 whole manner was petrifying and harsh.  A previous owner, surgeon Christopher Thorn, said Ms Lees\u0027 behaviour was so bad his partner had moved out with their baby daughter. Mr Kaye explained the terrible effect of the harassment, which he said rendered his flat worthless, because no one will buy it. Not only has she made my life a total misery but she has also inflicted the same misery on all the previous occupiers, upon my tenants, upon the estate agents and everyone who has had any contact with her, he said. This has been going on for over 10 years. Each previous occupier has effectively been forced out of their home by her actions, including me. My property is now effectively worthless, as I do not believe that anyone would be prepared to purchase it due to her actions. I really cannot overestimate the effect that she has had on me and upon my health. Ms Lees - who wrote the Kumari trilogy of teen novels - was not legally represented and did not give evidence during the hearing of the civil harassment and nuisance claims. However, in response to a complaint by another tenant about her behaviour, she had denied doing anything wrong at all, the judge noted.

Especially at the end of a hot summer\u0027s day. But it turns out this could pose a serious threat to our health, if we don\u0027t take certain precautions. Experts have recently highlighted that ice cream is one of the lesser-known causes of food poisoning, and can be just as bad for you as undercooked BBQ food. Amreen Bashir, a Lecturer in Biomedical Science at Aston University, has spoken out about the dangers of the sweet treat.   She told theconversation that around one million people are affected by food-borne diseases in the UK every year.  And the risk is especially high when going on summer picnics or having a BBQ as these remove the safety provided by a kitchen. However a food that can make you just as sick as undercooked BBQ grub is ice cream - but it turns out many people don\u0027t know this. She said: Aside from the well known risks of diabetes and obesity, ice cream really does have the potential to make you very sick.  In 2015, five people were hospitalised and three died after eating ice cream that had been contaminated by Listeria in Topeka, Kansas.   Amreen explained that the most common mistake people make with ice cream at home is refreezing a tub that has already started to melt. Ice cream can also pose a danger after purchase if it has melted and then been refrozen, she said. This often happens when it is taken from the freezer, left out to thaw and then returned to the freezer before being taken out again to eat later. Ice cream melts fairly rapidly at room temperature and the milky, sugary, liquid concoction is a perfect petri dish for bacteria like Listeria, essentially the second time you dig into the tub.  But that\u0027s not all. Another mistake people make with their ice cream is to double dip their spoon. As well as being inconsiderate to other people in your house, Amreen says a dirty spoon is also an invitation to every nasty bug nearby. Those who opt to try making their own ice cream can also be caught out by some of the ingredients.

Tony Sheldon, 58 and bride-to-be Sue Boyce, 67, booked the P\u0026ampO Mediterranean Arcadia cruise for the once-in-a-lifetime wedding and honeymoon. They spent their \u0026pound10,000 life savings on the trip - only for it to be hit with disaster after disaster. Four days after departing Southampton on January 14 this year, Tony fell ill during their first stop in Palma, Mallorca, and was rushed to intensive care with a collapsed artery.  The couple claim they were landed with a \u0026pound32,000 hospital bill after cruise bosses sent Tony to a more expensive private hospital further away in the city instead of a closer public one he claims would have treated him for free with his European Health Insurance Card.  And the pair, from Tamworth, Staffs, claim their problems worsened when they discovered Tony\u0027s AXA holiday medical insurance wouldn\u0027t pay out due to him forgetting to disclose a minor stroke - before discovering the ship and all their luggage had departed without them - just minutes after Tony had been taken ill.  And after facing a seven-day journey home when Tony could not fly, they faced more stress when their luggage was returned several weeks later - and they discovered retired hairdresser and manicurist Sue\u0027s \u0026pound3,000 wedding dress \u0027bundled up as if a child had packed it\u0027. Tony, a semi-retired property and garden maintenance worker, said: We put all our savings together for this once in a lifetime dream cruise - but it turned out to be a nightmare from hell. We thought it was the best way to combine everything in the most affordable way as we didn\u0027t want to get married in a registry office and romantic Venice was our dream. But instead the ordeal caused Sue and I to split, as we couldn\u0027t take the stress and the pain. This should have been our dream wedding and we have been left with a huge bill and no way of getting that money together again. At our age, it would be impossible to earn that amount again. I have never been in debt in my life and now I\u0027ve been left depressed and heartbroken by the whole ordeal. Sue added: We will never understand why Tony was taken to a private hospital when he could have been taken to a public one just around the corner, where he would have been treated for free. Tony and Sue, who met in February last year, fell in love straight away and Tony proposed in June after four months during a cruise to Rome.  The couple set about planning the big day and booked the Arcadia ship from Southampton to Palma - planning to stop to marry in Venice and visit Hvar, Dubrovnik and Gibraltar before making their way home. But after returning to the boat after a day sightseeing in Palma, Tony was feeling ill and returned to the cabin to lie down. Sue called the ship doctor and an ambulance was called - with paramedics suspecting Tony was having a heart attack and would have died without Sue\u0027s prompt intervention. As Tony was rushed into surgery, Sue claims she was ushered into a room to sign paperwork and later forced to stay in a dirty and inadequate room in a care home nearby as she waited for Tony to recover. The couple allege they did not realise Tony had been taken to a private hospital when Tony was asked to pay a deposit from his hospital bed after the first surgery. Tony was then told he would need further surgery at an extra cost of \u0026pound17,000 on top of the bill for his initial care - meaning he was forced to discharge himself and return to the UK for the second op. He said: They came to me in ICU with hands open and told me they needed a deposit so that I could have the second operation.  That\u0027s when we realised it was a private hospital, at no point before this were we told. We were never even asked if we wanted private care or if we could afford it. When they demanded we pay the 36,000 bill in 28 days, we were devastated. They also told us my insurance wouldn\u0027t pay out because I hadn\u0027t updated them about a very minor stroke I had. I had never been given or asked to fill in any medical forms, and had been told by doctors it was just a scare. The dad-of-two was forced to discharge himself and was escorted from the hospital in a gown before the couple found themselves stranded as the ship, along with their luggage had departed without them. Tony was unable to fly after his recent surgery and the couple had no money to get them back to the UK but were helped by family so they could journey back to Barcelona via an eight-and-a-half hour ferry. After two nights in a hotel, they were then able to take an 18-hour boat trip from Santander port, in Spain to Plymouth - but not before they were forced to pay for a \u0026pound900 [ 1056] taxi journey to get to get to the dock. In total, their journey home took them seven days.  Tony said: I was still quite ill but I knew I needed to get back to the UK so I could have my second operation. We were so glad to be home after our seven day trek back to the UK, but felt like we had lived as tramps and were totally devastated that we never got to have the dream holiday and honeymoon we had so longed for. The ship sailed away just three minutes after us being rushed off ship. When we received our luggage back two weeks later and it was ruined and bundled in the suitcases as if a child had packed it. Sue\u0027s \u0026pound3,000 wedding dress was trashed and not all of our items had been returned to us. P\u0026ampO offered us a miserly \u0026pound500 each which is disgusting, the cost of our lost and damaged goods alone would have been at least \u0026pound1,200. With the cost of the hospital bill, the cost of the cruise and the money to get home, we have lost around \u0026pound50,000. A P\u0026ampO Cruises spokesman said: Our priority is always the well-being, swiftest and most suitable treatment for any guest needing medical attention.

The driver comes to a halt and exits the car, wearing sunglasses as the rider shouts: You hit me. You\u0027ve hit me husband. And you\u0027re all on bloody camera. So that\u0027s it. Police phoned. She then moves round with the horse to her husband who is sitting at the side of the road tending to what appears to be an injured arm. The driver tries to apologise to the irate couple, who continue to question him. The rider angrily confronts the driver and says: Why did you try and kill me? Eh? Why did you try and kill me? The driver then tries to explain himself but the rider interrupts: You didn\u0027t make a mistake, you did it on purpose. The video then ends as the woman implores her husband to phone the police. On social media, Jenny Baker-Griffiths said: He was in the middle of the road. Wearing sunglasses and coming out of bright sunshine, I doubt he\u0027d have seen anything on the road. Didn\u0027t matter which side the horse was on, he\u0027d have been temporarily blinded by coming out of the sunlight and the sunglasses. Be thankful it wasn\u0027t a child he hit.

Louis Morgan, 34, was holding his partner Rhiannon Mills\u0027s four-year-old daughter under his arm while he carried out the sick attack on her outside her home in Immingham, Licolnshire. And when confronted by her 66-year-old neighbour Gwen Kaplan, he launched a brutal assault on her too. Ms Kaplan had overheard Morgan\u0027s partner being attacked and dialled 999 before he turned on her and chased her inside her house. After smashing through her locked front door and bay window with a kettle and plant pots, Morgan picked up two knives and went into the upstairs bathroom, where she was hiding. He then repeatedly stabbed Ms Kaplan, screaming am I an animal, am I? in a frenzied attack.  She had to pretend to be dead before Morgan stopped, dropped the weapons on the ground and returned outside to his unconscious girlfriend and her daughter. When police arrived at the scene, blood-stained Morgan was immediately arrested as paramedics attended to his victims. Miss Mills was laid outside the house in a pool of blood, with prosecutor Jeremy Evans telling Sheffield Crown Court police said she was in a dreadful condition and appearing moribund. Morgan left her so badly injured and with such a traumatic brain injury she did not know she had a daughter. Morgan, of west Hull, told police: You were first on the scene. You’re a police officer. You must have seen some bad stuff. I bet you have never seen anything that bad. What I did was horrific.  During an interview, he said: It is not pretty bad, it is very bad. It is serious. It is the worst thing that I have ever done. On the night of the attack, Miss Mills called at the home of her neighbour, 66, just before 7pm dressed in just her night clothes and in a state of distress, asking for the police to be called. Mr Evans told the court she refused to leave her daughter with Morgan, who thought his girlfriend was having an affair. When Miss Mills returned to the house, Morgan then viciously attacked her in a sustained and brutal assault witnessed by neighbours, who heard the woman screaming: No, no, no, get off. As she lay on her back, Morgan punched and kicked her to the body and stomach, before stamping on her head, all the while holding her daughter under his arm. Morgan and the toddler went back into the girlfriend’s home and came out again wearing coats. Morgan remained crouched down at her side with the child on his lap. When Ms Kaplan rushed out to help, Morgan asked her if an ambulance was on the way. She confirmed it was and called Morgan an animal for his sick attack.  But Morgan then turned on the neighbour, storming inside her house after she had locked the front door and chasing her upstairs to the bathroom. A 999 call the woman made that was played out in court heard Ms Kaplan screaming for help and Morgan shouting am I an animal, am I? Trapped between the toilet and shower, she was unaware she was being repeatedly stabbed with two knives. She believed the only way to stop the defendant was to play dead and therefore feigned unconsciousness,”Mr Evans said. Ms Kaplan suffered five cuts to her face and neck, three deep cuts to the inside of her right hand and four deep stab wounds to the outside of her right hand. The only reason Morgan attacked her was for being a Good Samaritan and having the courage to confront him, the court heard. The court heard Miss Mills suffered swelling to her face and eyelids after he had stamped on her head. Scans revealed a fractured right cheek bone and she had to be tube fed. She had two puncture wounds to the back of her head and bruising and grazes to the shoulders, knees and elbows, and bruising to the abdomen. Her skull was also fractured. Medical experts reported Miss Mills had features of a traumatic brain injury with post-concussion symptoms, and she has no memory of the night. For a number of weeks, she did not know she had a four-year-old daughter, said prosecutor Jeremy Evans. The attack was sustained and brutal and was likely to have been instigated by Morgan’s jealousy because he believed she had been unfaithful to him. Speaking in court, Miss Mills said his unprovoked attack ruined her life. She said she feels vulnerable and unable to do household chores and put on her makeup, and is physically and mentally exhausted. I did nothing to provoke this attack, Miss Mills said. What he has done is ruin my life.

Advisors have held at least three top-level crisis meetings planning how to stop the former Hollywood lighting director piling distress on his daughter. The new Duchess of Sussex has not spoken to her dad since she married Prince Harry 10 weeks ago, and a royal source has now told the Mirror there\u0027s one thing which could be the final straw for the family. During an recent interview, Mr Markle referenced Prince Harry\u0027s late mum Princess Diana.  Speaking to the Mail on Sunday , he said: They [the Royal Family] have Meghan treating her father in a way that Harry\u0027s mother, Princess Diana, would have loathed. That\u0027s not what Diana stood for. The duchess was also said to be deeply embarrassed and hurt that her dad mentioned Diana. The Mirror\u0027s source added: This could be the final straw for Thomas. A line has been crossed. Mr Markle has been interviewed several times about Meghan and the royal family in the past. In one interview, which Harry was particualy angry about, he revealed details about a conversation with his new son-in-law including his views on Donald Trump and Brexit.  Today, the Mirror has exclusively revealed the royal family have decided they\u0027ve had enough of Thomas Markle\u0027s public outbursts about Meghan. A source said: Meghan is deeply hurt by what is happening and everything is being done behind the scenes to make sure her welfare is at the top of the agenda. It\u0027s an increasingly desperate \u0026shysituation and now it\u0027s come down to three options being on the table. Firstly, Meghan could contact her father straight away and appeal to him directly to ask him to stop hurting her, but right now she\u0027s decided to cut him off.

City worker Zoe Gladden, 25, who had been drinking, reduced ticket inspector Diana Herban to tears after calling her a f***ing rude bitch and a foreigner. Gladden, who works at a top shipping brokers in the City, began her sickening attack after she was stopped on the platform for not having a ticket. However her defence lawyer Lesley Hayes told Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court the incident wasn\u0027t one-side, adding that there was some degree of provocation. Gladden modelled for fashion company Flawless Furs, which sold glamorous bikinis, dresses and fur products to reality TV stars. According to the Instagram page, since deleted, TOWIE star Amber Turner and Love Island\u0027s Georgia Harrison recently snapped up bikinis modelled by Gladden.  Gladden, who is an operations manager at shipping broker Simpson Spence Young, is said to have harassed Greater Anglia worker Ms Herban at Liverpool Street Station on June 28. The court heard she was stopped for not using a ticket to access one of the train platforms and Ms Herban was called over as the argument became heated. Prosecutor Carly Loftus said: It was approximately quarter past 11 in the evening and the complainant was a Greater Anglia revenue production officer working on platform six and seven. The defendant was stopped by a Greater Anglia staff member at platform six who thought she had shuffled through the barrier. She tried to use her phone to tap through the barriers. She was very rude towards gateline staff and Ms Herban was called over to assist. She attended and said Miss Gladden needed a railway ticket and she would need to go and buy one. She was agitated and angry and shouted at Ms Herban.  Ms Herban smelt alcohol on her breath. She became increasingly aggressive and Ms Herban became worried. The court heard Gladden told the worker: \u0027You\u0027re just a f***ing rude b****. \u0027I travel every f***ing day on National Rail, you can\u0027t tell me I don\u0027t have a f***ing ticket.\u0027 Ms Loftus continued: She then tried to get the train but left and came back. She started shouting at Ms Herban that she had missed her train because of her. She said: \u0027You worthless piece of s***, do you even have papers to work in this country?\u0027 She was telling her to \u0027f*** off\u0027 and also telling her \u0027you\u0027re a f***ing foreigner and you should go back to your own country. Magistrates\u0027 heard that at this point Ms Herban became very upset and walked away from Gladden. A British Transport Police Officer was approached and asked to help, it was said. In a victim impact statement read to court, Ms Herban said she felt the situation had been \u0027very unfair\u0027. She said: You feel like you are nothing. You\u0027re useless, you\u0027re not a human being. It doesn\u0027t matter what gender, colour or religion you are.  It doesn\u0027t make her better than me because she\u0027s English. I started to cry while I was on the platform. People like to humiliate and make others feel horrible on purpose. It makes me feel I don\u0027t belong here in this country. It makes me doubt myself. I just wanted to have a bit of respect. I should not have had to tolerate this behaviour. The court heard Gladden has a previous conviction of a court order for battery in 2011. Ms Hayes, defending, said: What you hear is one side of the argument. What was put forward by Miss Gladden is that this wasn\u0027t one-sided. There was some degree of provocation. She had used her phone to tap in, this hadn\u0027t been seen by someone who worked at the station. She was refusing to listen or accept what was being said by the defendant. An argument ensued. She was very rude to her and she was quite aggressive and insulting. She does accept she was rude back and it was escalated and she used words she shouldn\u0027t have used.

The 2017 Audi RS6 Avant, which can reach speeds of 176mph and only has 4,464 miles on the clock, has been listed for sale on Auto Trader this week.   Royal fans may recognise that it was the same car the Duke of Sussex was pictured driving Meghan to Pippa Middleton’s wedding last year.  Harry was photographed in the driver\u0027s seat next to a royal protection officer, while Meghan sat in the back obscured from view. It\u0027s also been claimed Harry would arrive in the car at Heathrow Airport when Meghan flew in from Toronto.  To avoid being photographed, Harry would have a police escort on to the tarmac at Terminal 2 and would whisk Meghan off in the Audi. And like any car used by the Royal Family, Prince Harry’s old Audi is kitted out with luxury features. The ‘Daytona Grey’ model has a panoramic sunroof, cruise control, heated seats, night vision assist, heads up display, a Bose sound system and seven-inch infotainment screen. Under the bonnet is a twin-turbocharged 4-litre V8 engine which delivers a whopping 552bhp. This gives it a 0-60mph time of just 3.9 seconds and a top speed of 176mph - making it one of the fastest family cars on the road.  The top-of-the-range super-estate was kitted out with \u0026pound11,000 of optional extras, taking the price new to \u0026pound91,500. But just one year later, Derby-based dealer Overton Prestige has bought the Audi and put it up for sale on Auto Trader for \u0026pound71,900. This is a saving of almost \u0026pound20,000 - despite the car having been driven just 4,464 miles. Erin Baker, editorial director at Auto Trader, said: “This is a smashing car perfectly suited to any aspiring Royal. “The Audi RS6 Avant is one of the fastest estate cars on the market doing 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds, and it has a roaring exhaust to excite any petrol head.

Being a member of the Royal Family comes with a LOT of rules, especially when it comes to dress code.  According to childrenswear designer Rachel Riley, who has dressed Prince George, it\u0027s to make sure she never looks out of date.  She said Kate will have chosen to put her in dresses so she looks timeless - choosing print florals and pastel shades.  Riley explained to the The  : If they wear very simple things… it\u0027s timeless in that you can\u0027t really date a specific photo or put them in something that seems out of date.  They have chosen a very traditional look and are a traditional family. It was previously revealed that Prince George always wears shorts for a very specific reason too.

Lee Campbell, 39, ignored warnings from a security guard in the crowd before he plunged off the bridge in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset, during one of England\u0027s World Cup matches. The topless Three Lions fan made the jump during half-time of the England v Panama match on June 24 when Gareth Southgate\u0027s side were 5-0 up. After clambering onto a ledge at the edge of Town Bridge, Campbell proceeded to hurl himself into the water. He was later discovered by police on a nearby pontoon, visibly inebriated.  Campbell was arrested for being drunk and disorderly in a public place and spent the night in a police cell before being released the next day. A video of the incident has since gone viral on social media, receiving over 33,000 views. Appearing at Weymouth Magistrates\u0027 Court, Campbell pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly in public and was handed a \u0026pound120 fine.

She is furious at the response from Sheffield University, claiming that they hand out harsher punishments to people for plagiarising. Meg has been left with a deviated septum which has required surgery and says she will need another operation in December. She also has a scar and is unable to breathe through one nostril. Yet despite this, no charges were brought against her attacker who allegedly bragged on social media about being \u0027Sheffield\u0027s most wanted\u0027.  The student was given a police caution, told to write an apology letter and attend an alcohol awareness course. The 22-year-old victim has now set up a petition urging universities to take violence more seriously, claiming she \u0027wouldn\u0027t recommend\u0027 people seeking justice through a university. A University of Sheffield spokesperson said the \u0027distressing\u0027 incident was considered a serious matter by the university and they are \u0027committed to learning lessons\u0027 from this experience. Meg, originally from Banstead, Surrey, said: It\u0027s disgusting. Dealing with an assault this leniently gives off the message that it\u0027s not important. I want to share just how incredibly disappointing, frustrating and inadequate the university\u0027s disciplinary process has been while dealing with the student that assaulted me.  As a result, I wouldn\u0027t currently recommend people seeking justice through the university. Many female students from different universities have said they have experienced the same thing since I\u0027ve spoken publicly. I\u0027ve now set up a petition which has received more than 5,000 signatures. Universities need to take responsibility for what happens on their campus and the type of graduates leaving their institution. On March 11 Meg attended a club night with friends when she spotted a group of shirtless men covering in paint. Intrigued, she asked one of them why they were painted and the man reportedly snatched her drink out of her hand and threw it over her. As Meg chased him with security in tow, the student reportedly turned and head-butted the bridge of her nose, breaking it. Meg said: I had just arrived at the Students\u0027 Union and we noticed there was a group of topless men with different colours painted on them.  I asked one of them why he had paint on him. He immediately took my drink out of my hand and threw it over me. He ran into the club and I followed him, at the same time getting the attention of security. I grabbed hold of the man\u0027s hand. He immediately pulled his hand away from me, turned around and head-butted me. He smashed his forehead into the bridge of my nose, I had blood pouring out. I went to Northern General Hospital in Sheffield for an x-ray on my wrist which was severely bruised. A week later when the swelling had gone down, it was confirmed at Royal Hallamshire Hospital that my nose was broken. It is permanently scarred from where the force of his skull struck the bridge of my nose, breaking the skin. It remains crooked and hooked despite it being painfully re-broken. My septum is deviated so I need further surgery. I also can\u0027t breathe through my left nostril at all.  After posting about the incident on social media, Sheffield University immediately suspended the student for three weeks, before allowing him to return to his lectures. Three months after the incident he was ordered to attend an alcohol awareness course and write an apology letter.  Meg said: I posted what had happened on Facebook and the university got wind of it.  He was suspended for three weeks then when it came to reviewing his punishment it was decided that he wasn\u0027t a threat to anyone and he was allowed to return to university. I find that really insulting. I was mortified, I expected that I would be safe around campus and walking around the city but was constantly scared I\u0027d cross the road and see him. The Students\u0027 Union has always been really helpful and banned him - the problem is with the university. The man was found by security staff at the Students\u0027 Union and was arrested, spending the night in a police cell. Meg said he was then released on caution after she claims police told her he would receive that punishment in court, despite her wanting to take it as far as possible.

Georgia Groom, 20, was horrified when boyfriend Jack Norman, also 20, suddenly stopped breathing and collapsed at their home. But she remembered seeing CPR performed by her favourite actors in the BBC show and sprung into action. Georgia called 999 and gave CPR to her asthma-suffering boyfriend to save his life at their home in Stevenage, Herts. Paramedics said she was a hero and told her if she had left it just another 30 seconds Jack would have died.  Brave Georgia said: “As you can imagine, I thought I had lost my boyfriend. “I could never, ever, ever have been able to live with myself if I didn’t know how to resuscitate him.” Jack woke up gasping for breath in the early hours of last Thursday and told his girlfriend he was “going to die”.

She said: “I was crying, there were so many emotions racing through my head. “The last thing he said to me was, ‘Georgia, I’m going to die’. He dropped to the floor and went completely white, stone cold. “It was awful. I laid him on his back and performed CPR. After about three to five minutes his heart started beating again. “I honestly thought I had lost him. I learned through watching Holby City. I knew what to do from watching it on TV. “I do feel so proud and I never thought I would’ve been in a situation like that. “I was not calm but I was calm enough to know what I needed to do to save the person that I love.”  Relieved Jack said: “If she didn’t act as quickly as she did I wouldn’t be here. “It was a normal week day. I got up early but I was finding it really hard to breathe. “I had some of my inhaler but it wasn’t giving me any relief. “Then I started deteriorating quite fast.

Scottish waitress Larissa Bell, 21, from Glasgow, was filmed waving her arms in the air and wiggling her hips as she stood on the emergency vehicle. She was spending a weekend in London with friends when she was recorded being cheered on by booze-fuelled Three Lions fans. Police say the restaurant worker, who was identified after the footage went viral following the match, was not formally arrested. She must also wait to learn if she will be charged over the incident as the investigation is ongoing. This week, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: A woman has been interviewed under caution.  The investigation is ongoing. Other supporters were also seen mounting the car, including a woman who flashed her bra and a Gareth Southgate lookalike. It is understood that Ms Bell had been staying with friends in Orpington, south east London, and travelled into the heart of the capital to watch England beat Sweden 2-0 on Saturday July 7th.

These devastating - yet also moving - images show the spot where little Levi Cole Ellerbe was allegedly left to die after being set on fire. The youngster was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after he was found with severe burns in Louisiana, USA, one night in July. He died from his injuries the next day, police say. His mum has since been charged in connection with his \u0027murder\u0027, while another woman was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder.  The touching blue-and-white memorial wreath was placed at the charred spot, near train tracks, by a retired law enforcement officer last week. Sharing the heartbreaking images of the cross online on Thursday, Tim Key said he had placed it at the location with a very heavy heart. He wrote: This is the hardest thing I’ve ever posted. Today I placed a wreath with a very heavy heart on behalf of the Natchitoches Police Department, Natchitoches Sheriff’s Department, Natchitoches Fire Department, Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office, Louisiana State Police, Northwestern Police Department, 911 Dispatchers and Natchitoches Regional Medical Center Emergency Room Staff. Tim, formerly of the sheriff\u0027s office, thanked each and every person that had worked nonstop on the case, adding: Also a special thank you to the Staff at Jeanne’s Country Garden for the beautiful wreath.  He finished: R.I.P. Baby Levi. Commenting on the Facebook post, one user responded: Tears flowing. Another wrote: A picture speaks a thousand words. And a third added: The most heartbreaking thing to see. Levi was discovered with obvious burns following a report of a blaze. It was claimed he had been kidnapped less than 90 minutes earlier when two people turned up at his mother Hanna Barker\u0027s trailer door. Barker, 22, told officers the pair \u0027beat\u0027 on the door, before she was sprayed in the face with a chemical substance she believed to be mace. She claimed she immediately fled her home to escape from the alleged attackers, but when she returned, she discovered Levi missing.  Officers received a 911 call at around 9.10pm on July 17, sparking a massive search for the young child in the Natchitoches area. Just over an hour later, at about 10.20pm, Natchitoches Police Department (NPD) received a report of a fire near railroad tracks. Arriving at the scene, they discovered Levi. The \u0027smiley\u0027 youngster was taken to Natchitoches Regional Medical Center, fighting for life, before being airlifted to another hospital. He passed away from his injuries on July 18, NPD said. Last week, the force said a woman from Natchitoches had been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder over the death of Levi. Felicia Marie-Nicole Smith, 25, was booked into the Natchitoches Parish Detention Center on Saturday, July 21, it added.   And in a later statement, the force said Levi\u0027s mum had been arrested and charged with principal to first-degree murder over his \u0027killing\u0027. Barker was booked into the detention centre awaiting a 72 hour hearing, according to the statement, posted on Facebook last Wednesday. The Natchitoches Police Department and the Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office have worked tirelessly together in order to learn the facts behind this Homicide, the statement read. The two agencies have worked as one since this investigation’s conception through extremely long days and nights with little to no sleep. On July 25, 2018, Hanna Barker, W/F, 22 years of age, was charged with Principal to 1st Degree Murder in the killing of her 6 month old baby boy, Levi Ellerbe. It added: Earlier this week, Natchitoches resident Felicia Marie-Nicole Smith was arrested for 1st Degree Murder in the case. An additional charge is expected to be brought against Smith.  According to local media, Barker and Smith have both since been charged with criminal conspiracy. Police said the baby had been found set on fire off Breda Avenue. In an earlier statement, they said: At approximately 9.10pm on July 17, NPD received a 911 call in reference to a 6 month old baby being taken from a residence in Mayberry Trailer Park. Officers arrived and spoke with the mother of the child who advised that two unknown subjects came to her trailer and began beating on her door. She stated upon opening the door she was sprayed in the face with a substance she believed to be mace. She immediately fled the residence to get away from the attackers and upon circling back discovered the baby missing. They added that officers began immediately searching the area, with the help of additional officers from other precincts. Meanwhile, firefighters attended the scene to check Barker out.

Despite living in Sheffield the couple flew to Jessica\u0027s home city of Chicago to say their vows, right in the middle of their sweltering hot summer. The couple and their families spent the day running around trying to get everything sorted so when the time finally came, they were all overjoyed when they were declared husband and wife. But as the photographer captured their first kiss - he also captured Kevin\u0027s sister Grace fainting in the background.   Kevin shared the comical photo, taken by photographer Sean Cook , on social media to mark their third wedding anniversary.  Speaking to the Mirror, he said: We\u0027d been out on the lake in the sun all afternoon taking pictures and then the ceremony was at 6pm in this converted loft with giant floor to ceiling windows. The venue looked incredible when we viewed it in October, but on a boiling summer\u0027s day in Chicago it had turned into a bit of a greenhouse. I think we were all running around so frantically that day that none of us had probably consumed enough food or water, so I think the heat ended up winning the day over my sister\u0027s ability to stay conscious through the ceremony. It was immediately after the judge said \u0027you may now kiss the bride\u0027, we were making our first embrace as a married couple and all of a sudden heard a thud. It took a moment or two to clock what had happened and then we looked down and saw my sister on the floor. Jessica\u0027s dad rushed forward, and before long everyone was gathered around Grace.  Kevin, who met Jessica at university, said: Everyone was stunned, initially we were all scared for her thinking it could be more serious than just a quick fainting. We all gathered around her, she came back to consciousness within 30 seconds. We were all just glad she was ok. Grace was a little flustered/embarassed and kept screaming that she\u0027d ruined our wedding - we assured her she hadn\u0027t and we were all laughing about it ten minutes later. After a quick break and a glass of water, they continued with the ceremony - but Grace was sitting down this time. Kevin said: We had our first kiss for the second time and then everyone enjoyed the rest of the night. The \u0027proper\u0027 first kiss photograph (second kiss) without my sister\u0027s ass and legs sticking out is kind of amusing in itself since there are a few flower petals still on the floor from where she\u0027d knocked over some flowers as she fell.

Sexually active people have been reminded by the health protection agency to use a fresh condom for each new sexual act. Research shows that around three percent of people in the US alone have tried to reuse condoms, while half have either put a condom on too late or removed it too quickly. If used correctly, condoms reduce the risks of contracting sexually transmitted infection sand help prevent pregnancy. Which is why the American agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has sent out the reminder that condoms should only be used once. CDC posted on Twitter this week: “We say it because people do it: Don’t wash or reuse #condoms! Use a fresh one for each #sex act.”  While condoms have been around for around 200 years there have been a number of surprising ways they have not been used properly. Washing or reusing condoms are particularly common. Between one and 3.3 percent of people have attempted to reuse them, according to one meta-analysis published in 2012. While there is only one way to use condoms correctly, there are several ways for it to go wrong. The same study shows that the most common errors when using a condom are putting in on too late, being around 50 per cent, or taking it off too soon, which is up to 44.7 percent.  Effectiveness can also be undermined by unrolling it before putting it on instead of unrolling it onto the penis. Partially unrolling it and not leaving space at the tip for semen collection is also a common mistake, as is failing to use lubrication. Storing condoms in unsuitable conditions, getting in contact with a sharp object or oils from lipstick can also damage them. As after one use, a condom has already been unrolled, and friction from sex has weakened the rubber. They are also no longer sterile after use after coming into contact with bodily fluids - and soap won\u0027t help.

The little girl, Veronika Khlopina, was marooned on the narrow 30 inch surface for ten hours - mostly in darkness - before her screams were heard. A massive search had been underway for the girl in the Russian city of Ufa after she vanished yesterday evening. There were fears she had been kidnapped after her father took her to the building site where he worked because he had no childcare at home.  She was last seen on the third floor of the unfinished high rise apartment block. One report said the girl was “bored” and wandered off. Somehow she fell out of an open window on the 15th floor. Miraculously, she landed safely on the ledge which had no barrier preventing her fall to the ground 150 ft below. She was found this morning when a new shift reported for work at the building site and heard her soft cries.  Her father Vladimir Dmitriev, 42, climbed down to care for her while rescuers arrived. Emergency ministry climbers plucked the child to safety - as seen in the dramatic video. She was reported to be “very scared” and had suffered an injury to her leg. Reports about the missing child had been posted on social media platforms. These showed her picture and described her as having blue eyes, dressed in jeans and a purple blouse, light colour sandals, and carrying a light-blue backpack. A full scale search had been underway across the oil-rich city in the Urals.

The man - seen from different angles in two separate video clips - taunted the animal from what he presumed was the safety of a wooden platform. In the first video recorded in the village of El Poble Nou de Benitatxell, near Valencia, the victim appears to be filming. The video shows the bull running down the street and then charging the person, who leapt onto the wooden platform. The animal is clearly annoyed and is seen scraping its feet on the ground, but is unsure how it can reach the man who is on the platform.  The man can be seen taunting it by coming to the edge and waving his hand. After sizing up the options, the animal reacts and charges straight at the man, jumping onto the stage as the camera turns black and screams and shouts can be heard from onlookers. The second video shot from further back shows the bull jumping over the wooden stage, knocking the man to the ground before flinging him into the air with its horns. The victim is a 45-year-old English speaker but neither his name nor his nationality have been reported.

Kepler 452b, discovered in 2015, lies in the middle of a newly identified abiogenesis zone where the right conditions exist for life to be spawned by starlight and chemistry. The planet, which has a radius 1.5 times that of Earth, also orbits inside the habitable or Goldilocks zone with temperatures not too hot and not too cold to permit liquid surface water. Almost 4,000 planets have now been discovered orbiting stars other than the sun. Of these, only about 50 are known to occupy their star\u0027s habitable zone.  However, just one - Kepler 452b - also falls inside the abiogenesis zone. A planet in the abiogenesis zone is bathed in the right level and type of ultraviolet radiation from its star to kick-start chemical reactions thought to have given birth to life on Earth. Scientists at Cambridge University coined the term after conducting a series of laboratory experiments mimicking the creation of life\u0027s building blocks. A leading theory for the way life began on Earth is that it emerged from chemical reactions involving hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulphite, powered by sunlight.  Duplicating earlier work conducted in 2015, the Cambridge researchers created the precursors of lipids, amino acids and nucleotides - all essential components of living cells. They then went a step further by comparing the UV light used in the laboratory to that generated by different stars. Generally the most sun-like stars were found to emit the right sort of light to trigger the formation of life\u0027s building blocks on planets. Kepler 452, in the constellation of Cygnus, is about 20% brighter than the sun and some two billion years older. The planet 452b has been called Earth\u0027s cousin. Computer simulations suggest it has a thick atmosphere, liquid surface water, and active volcanoes.  Lead scientist Dr Paul Rimmer, from Cambridge University\u0027s Cavendish Laboratory, said: This work allows us to narrow down the best places to search for life. It brings us just a little bit closer to addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe. Most known habitable zone planets orbit close to cool red dwarf stars. Occasional violent flares from the stars could provide the radiation needed to spark the birth of life, but may also destroy genetic material, said the scientists. The new research is published in the journal Science Advances. According to recent estimates, there could be as many as 700 million trillion Earth-like planets in the observable universe.

As soon as my dad walked in, I just felt like I was going to burst into tears at any point.“I had to have a tissue in my hand when I got married just in case.“I am not usually emotional but that day I just kept on crying.”Waiting at West Park Hotel was Lewis with best man Ryan Bruce and ushers James Simpson, Gavin Smith and Euan McCafferty and Lisa’s nephews Ellis and Luis Mordente who were an usher and page boy respectively.By her dad’s side, Lisa was piped down the aisle to the tune of Highland Cathedral.It’s not unusual for Godfrey to be seen at weddings as he is a well-known Dundee photographer.Lisa said: “It was amazing having my dad walk me down the aisle and then he became the photographer for the day too.“Because my dad has been doing wedding photography for so long he knew a contact for every part of our big day so that made it a bit easier.“All of the suppliers were amazing and I can’t thank them enough for helping put our wedding together.”After, the pair, who live near Tannadice Park, said “I do” the evening reception got into full swing.Local band Pepper Pot got everyone up on the dance floor, which is exactly what the bride had dreamed of.“I didn’t want a boring wedding – I wanted everyone to get up and have a good time,” she said.“I first saw the band at my sixth year dance and always said I wanted them to play at my wedding as they were such good fun. Luckily, my dad knew them too.“They played our first dance song Somewhere Over the Rainbow on a ukelele, which was lovely.“Ever since, people have been telling us that it was the best wedding they have ever been to and I have to agree.“I wouldn’t change a thing about the day – it went absolutely perfectly.“I am so happy to be married and want to thank everyone for all they did to make our wedding the best day ever.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b5b4652e80e1.jpg ","title":"dundee people every dog has its dayat errol show","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPooches put their best paws forward at the Errol Dog Show, held in glorious sunshine.Breeds including Irish wolfhounds, greyhounds and rottweilers were strutting their stuff with their owners as part of the event.The animals proved that every dog does indeed have its day as they enjoyed an array of activities in the summer sun.Some of them glammed up to stand out from the crowd, with a plethora of extravagant accessories on show.Despite pets coming in all shapes and sizes, the event went off without a hitch, attracting people from Dundee, Perthshire and Fife.Pictured are an array of dogs who weren’t afraid of “puperazzi” attention.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Nottingham-British-Finals-2018-Gold-2-x-silver-and-a-Bronze.jpg ","title":"dundee people gymnasts take a successful tumble","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA number of local gymnasts enjoyed success at the NDP British Championships in Nottingham.Five members of Dundee Gymnastics Club 2K travelled to the championships which saw them tumbling down a 25-metre track giving a display of back flips, somersaults and other gravity-defying skills.Earlier last month saw seven of the clubs tumble squad head to Birmingham to represent Scotland in the NDP British semi-finals.Five of these gymnasts qualified, for of those returning with medals.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page

development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness

airport for many years but none of them has gone ahead yet,\" he said.\"I think that most of the hotel operators prefer locations in or close to the city centre rather than out at the airport.\"However, it seems that IABP have now found a hotel operator willing to take the risk of the airport location.\"Inverness Airport has done very well in recent years and the hotel investment

They secured a 1-1 draw at Pittodrie last week, and headed to Aberdeen Airport after training at the stadium this morning.\u0026mdash Aberdeen FC (@AberdeenFC) August 1, 2018They will meet Burnley at Turf Moor tomorrow night.The current television deal with Sky Sports and BT Sport to screen 60 live Scottish Premiership games between them is for £18.95 million. It expires at the end of the 2019-2020 season.Scotland’s £18.95m is a pittance compared to the £5.14 billion the same two broadcasters are ploughing into the English Premier League over a three-year deal.There are similarities between the Dons and Burnley – two provincial clubs with stadiums of around 20,000 capacity and operating against bigger spending clubs.Yet the knock-on effect of that disparity in television deals saw Aberdeen receive £2.3m for finishing runners-up in the Premiership and Burnley £120m for seventh in England.In the 1-1 Europa League draw at Pittodrie the Dons attack was led by Sam Cosgrove, a £20,000 signing, while Burnley fielded £15m striker Chris Wood.But McInnes remains confident the Reds can bridge that gap over 90 minutes tomorrow to progress to the third qualifying round. He said: “When you talk about differences, there is not a big difference between the two clubs.“However, the huge gap between what we can do and what Burnley can do comes just because of the league they are operating in.“Burnley can grow and be the animal they are now because of the league they are in.“They have done brilliant to get there and the financial chasm is huge.“You see that when there is a £15m striker (Chris Wood).“Until television companies and finance change we can probably only do so much at times. However, in Aberdeen we have a proud tradition, are a proper club and will continue to be as competitive as we can be.“Burnley is a game we can win.”Scotland’s broadcast deal lags way behind nations such as Greece (£50m per season), Denmark (£46m) and Norway (£35m).The gulf between finances in England and Scotland, perhaps Celtic apart, was in the spotlight when Aberdeen sold top scorer Adam Rooney to Salford City, in the fifth tier south of the border, for a six-figure sum.However, Scottish football received a welcome boost last week with all four teams in European action registering decent results.Aberdeen drew with top-flight Burnley while Celtic, Rangers and Hibs all won their Euro ties.If the Dons could win the Battle of Britain with Burnley to set up a third round showdown with Istanbul Basaksehir it would surely silence some critics of the Scottish game.McInnes doesn’t care.All that concerns him is Aberdeen progressing to set up a trip to Istanbul.On possibly changing perceptions of the game in Scotland, he said: “I really couldn’t care less what people think who don’t watch Scottish football.“It probably still won’t change a lot of people’s opinions, to be honest.“But I know where we sit.“I know we are a good team.“I know our capabilities that we are good enough individually and can be organised as a team, that we can be really competitive.”Aberdeen today arrived in Burnley and were set to look around the stadium.They opted to train at Pittodrie this morning before flying down.McInnes played in England with West Brom and managed Bristol City and believes the perception down there, with those who actually watch the Scottish Premiership, is not all negative.He said: “I speak to enough players, managers and people within the game in England to know there is still a healthy regard from the majority of people in the game for our league.“And rightly so.“Players have moved from the Scottish Premiership to top clubs in England and will continue to do so.“What other people’s perception of the Scottish league is I really couldn’t care – it is not important to me.“Our focus is on getting a result at Turf Moor and I have the players to take the challenge on and try to win that game against Burnley.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/SNS-15257867-ABERDEEN.jpg.jpg ","title":"weve had a conversation with swansea aberdeen boss mcinnes confirms approach for scott mckenna","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen boss Derek McInnes today confirmed Championship side Swansea City have made an approach for defender Scott McKenna.However, McInnes has warned Swansea, and any other interested clubs, that they will have to come in with a massive offer to test the Reds\u0026#8217 resolve to retain McKenna who he hailed as the best defender in Scotland.McInnes reckons McKenna is as good as £18 million man Alfie Mawson who Swansea recently sold to Fulham.McInnes accepts the 21-year-old, who is contracted until 2023, will eventually move on from Pittodrie but hopes it is not this summer.And he is convinced the defender, who captained Scotland this summer, is so good he can  bypass the Championship to ultimately play in the English top flight.Talking at Burnley\u0026#8217s Turf Moor ahead of tomorrow\u0026#8217s Europa League tie, McInnes said: \u0026#8220We’ve had a conversation with Swansea.\u0026#8220There’s not been an official approach.\u0026#8220They asked about Scott’s availability and that was it.\u0026#8220I don’t expect them to make an offer but if they do it’s not something we would be encouraging.‘That was the gist of the conversation.\u0026#8221After banking £18m for the sale of Mawson to Fulham, the are Swans ready to test Aberdeen with an offer.Swansea only have a week to secure McKenna as the transfer window in England closes on August 9.Aberdeen rejected a bid in excess of £1m from Hull City for McKenna during the January transfer window.‘We are not saying he is not for sale,\u0026#8221 said McInnes.“But any offer for McKenna will need to be way over the top \u0026#8211 whether that’s in this window, the next window or a future window.‘It’s not a matter of if Scott McKenna leaves Aberdeen.“ It’s when.

You might not inherit anything if they died without having written a will.If you’re living together but not married, you could think about writing a cohabitation agreement.This is a relatively simple legal document that can cover all manner of things in terms of shared financial responsibilities, children, how things would be shared if you split, ownership of joint assets or debts, to name a few.A high street solicitor can draw one of these up for a few hundred pounds.Having kids is amazing/awful (depending on who I ask and when!) but certainly comes with more than the immediately obvious responsibility of keeping the wee one alive.Update your will (or write one!) – you should choose a  for your child if you / and your partner if you have one, were to pass away – getting ship can be onerous for loved ones if you haven’t made your wishes known in advance.Why not think about opening a savings account for your child when they’re born?

Diversification = don’t put all your eggs in one basketWhen it comes to markets that means:Using a straightforward investment portal that has transparent charges, and choosing a fund which is not expensive (over 0.50% per year is expensive in my book).Not logging in and fiddling every day. Set up a regular investment and check it as little as you can. Every year if you can bear it.Choosing a fund that invests globally, not just in the UK.Betting on the World Cup or playing the lottery is the complete opposite of all of these things:The bookie or the lottery company take a cut, (even if it doesn’t look like it at first, it will be built into the price you pay in some way).They are designed to give us a short-term high, to change our mind about the winning team or number and place another bet (or five).You bet on a single team out of dozens, or worse, for your one in 14,000,000 chance to win.That is why stock market investing, when done right, is not a gamble.And why you shouldn’t be staking your future on the next trip to the bookies.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jargon gets lost in translation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery industry has it, to one extent or another.

That meant so much to my mum and to all of us.“I think sometimes the staff are overlooked and so I wanted to raise money to give back.”Blair, who works as a baker on an offshore rig, has overhauled his lifestyle to train for his mammoth cycle in September.He said: “I did do Tough Mudder a couple of years ago for charity, but this is the biggest and hardest thing I’ve done – I didn’t even own a bike this time last year.“My family was quite worried when I first told them, especially my granny, but they are all really supportive. I’ve made big sacrifices for the training, the biggest being quitting smoking which has been hard because I’ve been a smoker for 15 years.“Training has been harder in the heat, and fuelling has been trial and error, but cycling definitely reminds you of the beautiful countryside we have around us.“Thinking of my mum gets me through and reminds me why I’m doing it, plus it’s for such a good cause.“You have to become stronger after things like this, but it’s not been easy.“She will never meet my future wife or my children but it’s made me appreciate life more and look at the bigger picture.”A group of Blair’s friends and family will meet him at the finish line, including dad Stanley, brother Craig, sister Nicola and girlfriend Katy.He added: “I think afterwards Katy and I will head to a spa to recover.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council staff get set for a great day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil staff are lacing up their running shoes for the Great Aberdeen Run.Some 50 workers from across Aberdeen City Council (ACC) are in the final stages of preparation for the Great Aberdeen Run, taking to the streets of the Granite City on August 26.Jenny Laing, co-leader of ACC, said: “We’re very excited about the return of the Simplyhealth Great Aberdeen Run to the city.“It’s fantastic that council staff are getting on board to be a part of the event and also embracing the charity opportunities the day provides.\u0026#8220We are immensely grateful to every one of our fundraisers for all their efforts.”Among those council workers taking up the challenge are Robin Dillaway, from the finance team, Donna Cuthill from the education department and Ka Kuen Mo from the resources team.Robin praised the community feel among ACC runners.He said: “With many of us taking part from Aberdeen City Council there will be no shortage of friendly colleagues around for moral support at the start line.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/ee-db27072018-1-22.jpg-847x564.jpg ","title":"msp in littered underpass call to city council","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen MSP has raised concerns over the state of a littered underpass used as a route for school pupils.Mark McDonald, MSP for Donside, has been contacted by constituents over the condition of the Millhill Brae/Stoneywood Brae underpass which is littered with rubbish, broken glass, discarded cans and dog mess.Locals, who have concerns about school pupils using the underpass ahead of the new term beginning next month, contacted the MSP in a bid to see the area cleaned.The underpass does not belong to the local authority but Mr McDonald had asked the council to find out who owns the site.Mr McDonald, who says the underpass has been in a “poor state for “some time”, was initially told by council officers that they do not hold information on the current owners and that there are various companies who could undertake a private search on behalf of a constituent to try to establish ownership – a move which could cost money.But a spokeswoman for the local authority later said it was working to identify the owners and would take “appropriate action” to ensure they maintain the site.The Independent MSP said: “I am glad the council has finally seen sense, after initially suggesting that my constituents should be paying themselves to find out who owned the underpass.“The council should be reacting to concerns from residents and ensuring routes to school, as this underpass will be, are clean and safe.“Rather than having to be effectively shamed into doing so.”A local authority spokeswoman said: “Aberdeen City Council does not own the Millbrae/Stoneywood underpass and therefore it is not responsible for its upkeep.“The council does not hold information on the current owners.“It is in the process of identifying the owners and will take the appropriate action to ensure the owners maintain the underpass.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"playgroup is helping kids learn","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east playgroup provide a nurturing environment for children to play and learn, inspectors have said.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Monymusk Playgroup at Jubilee Hall on June 20 and have now published their report.The group can look after up to 30 children aged two and three.Inspectors rated the group “good” for care and support – the third best of six possible ratings.“Monymusk Playgroup staff’s welcoming, sensitive and friendly interactions created a nurturing environment for children to play and learn,” said the report.It added: “Children were comfortable and confident in staff’s company and readily approached them for help and support.”One parent told inspectors: “I am extremely happy with my daughter’s playgroup.

He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters week 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 16/06/18, 5:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe Now[Usual Science Matters logo]The battle for survival between native red and invasive grey squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

The drama and uncertainty of the Yot Spot era can now be forgotten in Ardrishaig, as the new Steamer Terminal cafe opens. If it is managed properly and folk work together, there is surely enough cafe business to go round everyone in Ardrishaig.Then there are the school awards. Well done to the Tarbert pupils and staff, hot on the heels of the Lochgilphead presentations a couple of weeks back.As for good news, we can\u0026#8217t go much beyond the weather.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

We’ll never know – but hopefully our newspaper will survive to provide some information. For an Ayrshire Post is among items going into a new time capsule at the top of the Burns Monument at Alloway. Also included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank \u0026pound10 note, with a picture of Burns on it. Poignantly, there’s also a drawing of Robert Burns by National Trust for Scotland volunteer Isla Grant, 17. And there’s a letter by NTS trainee Parris Joyce on what The Bard means to her. Hopefully, the monument will survive well into the future as a result of a near \u0026pound500,000 restoration.  The old capsule turned up when workers removed the gilded urn that sits atop the monument. The urn is being regilded, and a new airtight-sealed time capsule will take the place of the old one. NTS staff suspected there might be an old capsule there.  That’s because of an old letter from a Thomas Hamilton to a John Connel (building contractor) on April 23, 1823. The letter mentions enclosing a hermetically-sealed glass bottle soldered into the tripod, and containing various items. As it happens, the Burns enthusiasts of the time chose a copper container, as the one that came out of the urn was covered in verdigris. Items inside included two Ayr newspapers of the day – an Ayr Advertiser and a West Country Journal – dating from 1816 and 1815 respectively. Although now in a poor state, these appear to have been chosen for stories they carried about proposals for a Burns Monument. The original capsule also contained a silver sixpence depicting George III. Spookily, the urn containing that capsule was erected following a parade to the then new monument on July 4, 1823. And the old capsule saw the light of day again, on July 4 this year.  The monument was built by public subscription and fundraising, and the restoration is also being funded  by donations.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"electrical raiders short circuit ayr","story":"NewsElectrical raiders short-circuit in AyrThieves forced to pull plug on sneak raid at CurrysPCWorldShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:09, 1 AUG 2018Updated13:29, 1 AUG 2018NewsSecurity was breached at the temporary fence on the right (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSneaky thieves used an empty shop to try to reach a lucrative haul of household appliances. They easily got into the half-open unit — then smashed their way into the Currys PC World store right next door. But the hundreds of thousands of pounds of electrical stock inside remained intact. The daring thieves smashed down a fire door to get into the stockroom — but all the expensive items were locked inside metal cages. And they did not get access to the showroom at the front. Store staff called in police at opening time on Saturday after discovering the mess they made. One source said: “This was an audacious attempt to clean the place out of valuable goods including computers, TVs and kitchen goods. “But they got absolutely nothing.” The raid happened in the early hours of Sunday, with the raiders exploiting the empty store next door. It used to be part of the electrical and computing chain, but is being turned into the 24-hour, no-frills PureGym. But access is simply over a seven foot high metal fence. The source added: “There were no extra security measures and no alarms, it was easy to get in and most of the entrance was open to the four winds. “The gang used hammers and cutting gear to batter down a fire exit door. They made a right mess but staff are glad they didn’t penetrate the sales floor.” Police forensic teams remained at the site most of Saturday and a security guard has now been put in place until it is properly secured. Ayr police confirmed the break- in and a spokesman said: “As yet there are no suspects and nothing has been stolen. We will be looking at CCTV and the incident is currently being investigated.” Currys PC World said: “We can confirm there has been no stock loss and the investigation into this incident is continuing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPC and Mac"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13014611.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS158038312.jpg","title":"new arrivals bring light parents","story":"NewsNew arrivals bring a light to parents\u0027 livesWe wish all the best to the new happy families, and any other recent newborns.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:56, 1 AUG 2018NewsNew arrivals in AyrshireGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA number of new arrivals have been welcomed to Ayrshire.

A Morrisons spokeswoman said: “Due to a higher than normal demand one day this week, our Ayr store ran out of 10p bags. They have received a delivery since.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSupermarketsAyrKilmarnockTroonAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"teen golfer cards course record","story":"NewsTeen golfer cards course record and gets hole-in-oneHe scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston14:44, 1 AUG 2018NewsHe\u0027s number one Glenn Wilson of Dalmilling golf club (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 15-year-old boy has equalled the golf course record at his club ... carding a hole-in-one along the way. Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"wilton-lodge-is-flying-flag-for-borders-parks","story":"HAWICK\u0026rsquos Wilton Lodge Park has become the first in the Borders to be awarded a coveted Green Flag, following its \u0026pound3.64 million revamp.\nThe 43-hectare park is only the second in the south of Scotland to pick up the award, which is the benchmark standard for publicly accessible parks and green spaces across the UK and around the world.\nJudges acknowledged the work carried out to improve the park as part of a regeneration scheme, which is due to be completed this summer.\nFunded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Scottish Borders Council, the face-lift has delivered a number of new facilities including a play-park, Zandra Elliot Bandstand, caf\u0026eacute and the McLaren Bridge.\nThere have also been improvements to the walled garden, waterfall walk and Hawick Museum, alongside the busy summer events programme which saw Hawick favourites Scocha play to more than 600 people earlier this month.\nThere has also been a number of other works carried out to the various shelters and memorials within the park, including the Cenotaph, Boer War Memorial, MacNee Fountain, Jimmie Guthrie Memorial, Laurie Shelter and Henderson Shelter.\nThanks to \u0026pound100,000 from SUSTRANS, improvements were made to the surface of footways, lighting and signage, along with a further \u0026pound20,000 from Smarter Choices, Smarter Placed fund to promote cycling.\nTree planting and improvements to the park\u0026rsquos main entrance, the Common Riding ceremonial area and Gilbert Davidson Fountain are also part of the regeneration project.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.

Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

Users will be able to set themselves time limits and receive alerts when that time is up.  They will also be able to mute all Facebook notifications for set periods if they do not want to be distracted during that time.  Facebook director for the UK and Ireland Steve Hatch said the tools, which start rolling out to users worldwide on Wednesday, would help raise user awareness of how they are spending their time online.  \u0026ldquoWe all recognise that technology is playing a greater role in our daily lives, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe feel a responsibility to help ensure that time on Facebook is time well spent.  Earlier this year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the firm was committed to improving the \u0026ldquomeaningful time people spent on the site, even if that meant less time spent on Facebook overall.  It comes as the social platform continues to face intense scrutiny over some of its practices, including how it polices content and users.  In response to the new tools, children\u0026rsquos charity the NSPCC said the site is still not doing enough to protect young people.  Laura Randall, the charity\u0026rsquos head of child safety online, said: \u0026ldquoFacebook and Instagram state they want to ensure their platforms are safe but to do so, they need to tackle serious problems within their sites.  \u0026ldquoTime limits do not address the fact that there are still no consistent child safety standards in place. Apps, sites and games continue to allow violent and sexual content to be accessed by children and sexual predators are free to roam their platforms, targeting and grooming young people.  \u0026ldquoThis lack of responsibility is why the legislation the Government has committed to must include a mandatory child safety code with an independent regulator to enforce consequences for those who don\u0026rsquot follow those rules.  Facebook\u0026rsquos new tools are similar to digital well-being features being introduced later this year by both Apple and Google to their mobile phone platforms.  Both, like Facebook, will show users how often they use their phone and the various apps, with time limits able to be set to help them cut down.  Mr Hatch said digital health is an \u0026ldquoindustry-wide issue that requires an industry-wide response, and that there is an expectation on Facebook as a leader in the field, to be part of that response.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not just about the time people spend on Facebook and Instagram but how they spend that time, the Facebook blog post on the new tools said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos our responsibility to talk openly about how time online impacts people \u0026ndash and we take that responsibility seriously. These new tools are an important first step, and we are committed to continuing our work to foster safe, kind and supportive communities for everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"migration-helps-scotlands-population-reach-record-high","story":"  Statistics from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) show there were 5,424,800 people living in Scotland halfway through 2017, up by 5% in the last decade.  Its report found migration is the \"main reason\" for the increase in recent years, with almost 24,000 more people coming to Scotland than leaving in the year to mid-2017.  While the rate of population growth has slowed, Scotland\u0027s population is still expected to rise to 5.58 million in 2026 and 5.69 million by 2041.  The document stated: \"Scotland\u0027s population continued to grow over the latest year to mid-2017 and is projected to keep growing ... The population has increased every year since 2000 and in 2017 was the largest ever seen.\"  Statisticians found that \"natural change\" - the number of births minus the number of deaths - has not contributed to Scotland\u0027s recent population growth, since there were 3,800 more deaths than births last year.  The report said: \"Migration is the main reason for Scotland\u0027s population increase.  \"In the year to mid-2017, 23,900 more people came to Scotland than left. This contributed to the increase in Scotland\u0027s population.\"  The trend is projected to continue over the next quarter of a century.  The latest net migration figure was, however, down on the previous year when it stood at 31,700 people, statistics show.  Most people moving to Scotland were found to come from the rest of the UK (47,600 people). In contrast, the number of people coming to Scotland from overseas decreased (32,900, down from 40,400 the previous year).  EU nationals make up 62% of the non-British population of Scotland and Polish is the most common non-British nationality.  Last year, there were 99,000 Polish nationals living north of the border - 2% of the total resident population.  In further findings, experts predict the population will continue to age over the next 25 years, with the fastest growing group those aged 75 and over.  In 2017, about one in five people (19%) were aged 65 and over but this is expected to rise to one in four (25%) by 2041.  The number of births in Scotland is continuing to fall, the figures show. There were 52,861 births registered last year, 3% fewer than in 2016 and 22% fewer than in 1975.  Meanwhile, the number of deaths registered in Scotland increased in 2017. There were 57,883 deaths last year, up 2% since 2016 and the highest number since 2003.  While life expectancy in Scotland has risen over the past three decades, it has \"stalled\" in recent years.  Amy Wilson, director of statistical and registration services at NRS, said: \"This year\u0027s review shows that while the population of Scotland is at its highest ever, at 5.42 million, and has grown by 5% over the last decade, this growth rate has slowed.  \"Over the latest year, Scotland\u0027s population has grown at a slower rate than on average over the past 10 years.  \"This is because of reduced migration levels as well as an increase in the number of deaths and decrease in the number of births.  \"However, Scotland\u0027s population is still projected to increase to 5.58 million in 2026 and to continue rising to reach 5.69 million in 2041.  \"We expect this growth to be entirely reliant on migration, as the number of deaths are projected to continue to be higher than the number of births.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8147350.jpg?type=article-full","title":"advertising-feature-lets-do-brunch-in-glasgow","story":"  Partick Duck Club has quickly been recognised as 1 of the best places to do breakfast \u0026amp brunch not just in the West End but in Glasgow and beyo.

The Society\u0026rsquos celebrants leapfrogged the Kirk\u0026rsquos ministers thanks to an eight per cent increase in ceremonies in 2017, compared to a 14 per cent fall in the Church\u0026rsquos marriages.  The figures were released by the National Records of Scotland as part of their annual round up demographic trends in Scotland.  The statistics confirmed a long-term collapse in religious services in Scotland, with exactly half of the 28,440 marriages last year being civil ceremonies.  In 1975, the Kirk conducted 16,849 marriages, the largest number by any organisation, and more than the 13,906 civil ceremonies that year.  However last year, Church of Scotland marriages were down to 3166, compared to the Humanist Society Scotland\u0026rsquos 3283.  There were 1182 Roman Catholic marriages last year, compared to 6,002 in 1975.  Although humanist weddings of all varieties have eclipsed religious weddings for several years, 2017 was the first with the HSS as the biggest single provider.  Former Socialist MSP and convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan recently announced he is training to be a humanist celebrant.  Lynsey Kidd, HSS director of services, said: \"These latest statistics are a major vote of confidence in the charity\u0027s meaningful and personal ceremonies.  \u0026ldquoWe know from couples that it is very important to them to have a ceremony which reflects, and is delivered by someone who shares their beliefs and values.  \u0026ldquoHumanist Society Scotland are now the number one provider of marriage ceremonies, more than any religious group or other belief body.  \"These numbers also reflect a wider trend of a decline in religious identity within the Scottish population. While it is important to recognise that faith plays an important part in a significant number of people\u0027s lives, Scotland has become a nation where it is now the the norm, not the exception, to have a non-religious Humanist approach to life.\"  Rev Norman Smith, convener of the Mission and Discipleship Council of the Church of Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoAlong with our sister churches, the majority of religious or belief\u0026ndashbased marriages in Scotland today continue to be from the Christian faith.  \u0026ldquoWhilst the rise of secularism means that fewer people may choose a religious ceremony, many people still find it meaningful to acknowledge the place of faith in their lives at such an important occasion.  \u0026ldquoWe would encourage anyone considering marriage to approach their local parish minister when thinking about their very special day."},{"url":null,"title":"toxic-weight-loss-chemical-seized-by-food-standards-scotland","story":"  Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said its food crime unit has recovered \"a quantity\" of powder believed to be the highly-toxic substance DNP.

The move would see rates reach their highest level since March 2009, when they were slashed from 1% to the emergency low of 0.5% in an effort to contain the fall-out from the financial crisis.  Investec economist George Brown said he is \"fairly confident\" the Bank will move to raise rates and is pencilling in an 8-1 vote in favour, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only dissenter.  Mr Brown believes the economy has performed in line with the Bank\u0027s last forecasts in May, when it backed off from a widely anticipated hike to wait and see how the economy recovered after a weather-hit start to the year.  The Bank also edged a step closer to pressing the button in June when its chief economist Andy Haldane joined two fellow policymakers in calling for a rise.  Howard Young at the EY Item Club believes the vote may be less definitive, given that inflation figures recently came in lower than expected - unchanged at 2.4% in June, while wage growth has also been weak.  It has become an even closer call after survey figures on Wednesday signalled a weaker performance from the manufacturing sector in July, according to Mr Archer, but he said this is \"unlikely to deter\" the MPC from raising rates.  He said: \"We believe that the odds still favour the Bank of England lifting interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75% on Thursday after the August MPC meeting - most likely following a split vote.\"  He added: \"With interest rates down at 0.50%, the Bank of England would clearly likely to gradually normalise monetary policy given that it is essentially an emergency low rate.  \"Furthermore, inflation remains above target and the labour market looks relatively tight with the MPC considering that there is little slack left in the economy.\"  The decision to raise rates would come as a blow to some borrowers on variable rate mortgages, but would offer relief to savers who have seen paltry returns on deposits since rates have languished at 0.5% or below since 2009.  It is thought the Bank\u0027s latest set of forecasts in the accompanying inflation report will reinforce the case for a rise, with many economists expecting growth to have recovered to 0.4% in the second quarter after slowing to 0.2% in the previous three months.  The Bank had already predicted in May that this would be the case and its latest set of forecasts are set to confirm its outlook for the year ahead.  But the Bank is likely to increase its inflation forecasts, with a weaker pound and higher oil and energy prices pushing up the outlook and further justifying the need for a rise.  The Bank\u0027s last move to raise rates in November from 0.25% to 0.5% was the first such move for more than 10 years, but merely reversed the cut made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  Mr Brown believes if it does raise rates again on Thursday, it will be the only increase in 2018.  But he predicts a quarter point rise every six months until rates reach 1.5% in 2020.  \"We think the bank wants to raise rates in a gradual way and that would be consistent with the next one in February,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-a-huge-geo-strategic-mistake-says-foreign-secretary-jeremy-hunt","story":"  Ramping up the government\u0026rsquos rhetoric in the face of EU resistance to the Chequers plan for a soft Brexit, Jeremy Hunt said his warning was not \u0026ldquoproject fear but \u0026ldquoproject reality.  Mr Hunt made the claim in Vienna alongside his Austrian counterpart Karin Kneissl.  However Ms Kneissl, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, downplayed the prospect of the UK and Europe failing to reach a deal on trade and customs by March 2019.  \u0026ldquoFrom the [European] commission\u0026rsquos side there is a clear-cut schedule, so an accident is not really something people are working for, she said, calling her talks with Mr Hunt \u0026ldquoexcellent.  But Mr Hunt was adamant the UK would not blink in negotiations, despite Europe saying parts of the Chequers plan are unworkable and a potential smugglers\u0026rsquo charters.  The UK\u0026rsquos proposal would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods, but avoid current restrictions on services and migration, something the EU regards as cherry-picking.  Mr Hunt said: \u0026ldquoWe have to make a decision on Britain\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU by the end of this year and we have to be very honest with ourselves about the choices that we face. At the moment we are heading for no deal by accident.  Despite Theresa May insisting a no-deal Brexit would be better than a bad deal, Mr Hunt said a no-deal legal and regulatory cliff edge would be a \u0026ldquohuge geo-strategic mistake with \u0026ldquoa profound impact on the relations between Britain and EU countries for a generation.  His comments coincided with Sky News revealing dozens of internal council plans to cope with a no-deal, including preparing for the possibility of social unrest.  Dover District Council and Kent County Council are preparing for a 13-mile lorry park on the M20 southbound for at least four years to cope with tailbacks at ports.  Pembrokeshire is concerned about food supplies, East Sussex fears care staff would quit the country, while Bristol says its top-line threat is \u0026ldquosocial unrest or disillusionment.  One of the most common complaints among councils was a lack of direction from Whitehall.  Kevin Bentley, chair of the Local Government Association Brexit Taskforce, said leaving the EU would have a \"significant impact\" on councils.

Theresa May, who interrupts her holiday tomorrow to visit France\u0026rsquos President Macron to push the Chequers plan, will have to make \"significant\" concessions to get a deal, a respected thinktank said.  The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the PM would have to pay more cash to the EU and accept higher migration, and warned an \u0026ldquoepidemic of uncertainty was already affecting the nation and its economy.  It said a no deal Brexit would end up costing the UK economy \u0026pound800 per person per year in lost output, while even the softer Chequers plan would cost \u0026pound500 per head.  SNP MP Peter Grant MP said the warning had \u0026ldquofallen on deaf ears in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe comments from the Foreign Secretary that the likelihood of a no-deal is increasing by the day, and that the UK government will not blink in its negotiations with the EU, are unbefitting of the office he holds.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Joining them in almost equal numbers will be the performers – including many stand-up comics such as myself. We’ll be the less enthusiastic ones with a slightly haunted look who haven’t seen sunlight for a long time as we’ve been working on our shows like pit ponies only for you to ignore our feeble attempt to hand over a flyer.             And previews are tough. Especially when your material is all untested, rambling and you’re performing to eight people in a sweatbox. One preview went so badly a nice elderly lady asked me if was the first time I had ever tried stand up. Everyone’s a bag of nerves right now. Will I remember my show? Will anyone will come and see me? Should I have brought a proper coat? The festival is the place to ponder big questions. Last year it was Brexit and I’m sure there will be much more of the B-word, but one of this year’s big themes is sexual harassment and feminism as a result of the #MeToo campaign. The revelations about Harvey Weinstein, which were the catalyst for the campaign, were shocking. Especially the bit about what he did in the plant pot. Gross. He’s surely the only person to get a life-long ban from Homebase.It was a big moment because, for the first time, it was okay for women of to speak about the sexual harassment or abuse they had encountered over the lives – much of it in the workplace. Before Me Too, you weren’t meant to say what had happened to you. It wasn’t the “done” thing and was seen as vulgar. Obviously grabbing your arse was fine – but workplace etiquette can be odd that way.             Then it all came out thanks to the brave women who had the courage to break that rule and go public. And so the veil of secrecy which had protected these men and given them impunity was lifted. And yes it was mainly men – because men are still mainly in charge in society and so much of this behaviour was not just about sex, it was about power.The #MeToo campaign went viral and it was like this lid had been lifted. Social media exploded with women of all ages, races and walks of life telling their stories and you realised that pretty much every woman had been affected by this kind of behaviour at some point in her life.READ MORE: Ayesha Hazarika: Emotion over reason is the new politicsThen we had Times Up and, of course, Donald Trump – you wait your whole lifetime for a big juicy gender equality campaign, then three come along at the same time.

Instead of women coming together to fight the patriarchy, it now looks like we came together to fight each other. I was hoping it would be like Made in Dagenham, sadly it seems to have gone a bit Prisoner Cell Block H.Whenever you turn on the television or radio or look at social media, women are always having a go at each other about feminism, which is what I explore in my show Girl on Girl. Whether it’s the gender pay gap or women on boards or up-skirting, the media (which is largely still run by white chaps) loves nothing more than seeing women taking lumps out of each other and shrieking – it’s like porn for the patriarchy, plus it keeps us women in our place and preserves the status quo. I have had some horrendous experiences after being made to debate women which feel more like a freak show or a dog (bitch) fight, than a considered discussion about important issues.             And of course, women don’t have to agree on everything – men certainly don’t. Men are allowed to have really diverse opinions and even if there is disagreement, they are allowed to be authoritative and respected.Their opinion may be challenged, but their right to hold it isn’t – especially by their opponent. There’s a mutual respect. Women, on the other hand, are pitted against each other on often highly sensitive gender-based issues and encouraged to get emotional and personal with each other.

How can you have a row with Childline?The #MeToo campaign is important but the job of feminism is far from done and the same issues still endure today that the Suffragettes campaigned on – better pay and conditions, childcare, women’s health, violence against women and, of course, women and power. Some women first got the vote a century ago, but women’s voices are far from being heard and respected in the same way men’s are.

The accusation was made by former Labour MP Brian Wilson who said the last months of Mr Kennedy\u0027s life were disfigured by the “disgraceful” campaign pursued by the SNP.            Mr Wilson said Mr Blackford led a campaign that “unleashed a torrent of abuse” against the former Lib Dem leader.            Mr Kennedy lost his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat to Mr Blackford in the 2015 General Election after a bitter and deeply unpleasant campaign. Shortly afterwards the former MP died in Fort William following his long battle against alcoholism.Writing in The Times, Mr Wilson was responding to an interview with Mr Blackford carried by the newspaper at the weekend.When questioned about the campaign, Mr Blackford said he was “proud” of the way the SNP conducted the campaign. He claimed to have no regrets when Mr Kennedy died claiming there was “absolutely no issue” between the Lib Dem and himself..But Mr Wilson said: “Nobody has sought to draw a direct link between Charles\u0027s death and the behaviour of Mr Blackford and his supporters during the campaign. But what is beyond doubt is that the closing months of Charles\u0027s life were disfigured by a vendetta that was as disgraceful as it was unnecessary.“As soon as Mr Blackford was selected as prospective SNP candidate in January 2015 he launched the hashtag `#Where\u0027sCharlie?\u0027, which became dog-whistle politics that undoubtedly unleashed a torrent of abuse.            “Anyone paying attention knew exactly where Charlie was. He was battling alcoholism. He was mourning the death of his parents. He was grieving the early demise of his closest friend. He was desperate to spend time with his young son. And he still had a better Commons voting record than any SNP MP.”Read more: Charles Kennedy\u0027s Scotsman obituaryIn the Times interview, the SNP MP was also asked about a now notorious incident when he marched angrily into Mr Kennedy\u0027s office during the election campaign and demanded that the Lib Dems remove a description of him as a “well-funded banker” from their campaign literature.Mr Blackford, a former senior executive at Deutsche Bank, had asked Mr Kennedy to “lay off” the personal attacks on him.“With the benefit of hindsight, which is a wonderful thing, perhaps it would have been better not to do that, but that’s what happened and the Liberals have sought to characterise it in another way,” Mr Blackford told the newspaper.            Mr Blackford went on to claim that he was the victim of a “nasty” campaign.He said: “I did not enjoy the election campaign in 2015 but that was more to do with the characterisation of me from the Liberals. I’m not in any way blaming Charles, who was the MP. It was the campaign against me. It was pretty nasty.”Read more: SNP official quits over Charles Kennedy online abuseBut Mr Wilson described this version as an “odious attempt to re-write history”.Within days of Mr Blackford launching the “#Where\u0027sCharlie?” hashtag, Mr Wilson said the chairman of the Skye SNP branch Brian Smith was tweeted about whether Charles “has a `problem\u0027 that stops you going to Westminster.”According to Mr Wilson, Mr Smith bombarded social media and Mr Kennedy\u0027s constituency office with invective.            Replying to a tweet from the SNP MP Pete Wishart, Mr Smith once described Mr Kennedy as “our own arch-Quisling”.A member of Mr Kennedy\u0027s staff worked full time to delete abuse from social media.Mr Wilson said: “Mr Blackford, undisputed author of the `Where\u0027s Charlie?\u0027 campaign now invites us to believe that he had no knowledge of these activities and no power to call off the dogs. I don\u0027t believe him.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen.

At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"115 north road lerwick 2 ","story":"OFFERS OVER £320,000\nEnjoying a commanding position and having the living area on the first floor affords this 2 storey house stunning panoramic sea views over Lerwick Harbour.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GAELIC-DRAMA-SUMMER-SCHOOL-18-8.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It was a fantastic opportunity to meet with like-minded individuals and share information regarding our available resources and capabilities. We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday. Those stations will also be open to the public on the weekend of 28th and 29th July between 10 am and 2 pm.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over.

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

sale after the club rejected a bid from Irish League champions Crusaders.\nIt is understood the offer would have smashed the Irish League transfer fee record which remains the �50,000 Linfield paid for striker Glenn Ferguson in 1998.\nMcGonigle (22) has been the Stripes\u0027 top scorer in each of the last two seasons and notched 20 goals in the 2017/18 season.\nThe Dungiven man\u0027s eye-catching performances saw him nominated for the Ulster Footballer of the Year Award while he was named in the NI Football Writers\u0027 Team of the Year.\nThe bid being rejected is absolutely the stance that we have taken, Bannsiders\u0027 boss Kearney told The Chronicle.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this

Pilgrimage 90 (GP90), takes place between August 5 and 9 and will be one of the largest in the charity’s history.

They will join more than 2,200 other Legion representatives and dignitaries, including Civic and military guests from the UK, Commonwealth and Northern Europe who are taking part.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOnce at the Menin Gate, Fred will lay a wreath on behalf of the Loughbrickland community.\n\nFred Cairns of the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion explained: “Great Pilgrimage 90 is a unique opportunity for the Legion community to come together and bear our Standards along the same route in Ypres taken 90 years earlier by the veterans and widows of the First World War. The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8578786.1532509495!/image/image.jpg","title":"nikita in the frame in specsavers contest","story":"\nDromore woman Nikita Harron is in the frame to be crowned Spectacle Wearer of the Year after making it through to the regional finals of the Specsavers popular annual competition.\n\n                \nNikita. who is a customer of the Lisburn branch of the opticians, was chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for the nationwide competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nNikita, who is shortlisted in the 16 - 24 category. could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning £10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual Spectacle Wearer of the Year Awards. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe was recently invited to the Lisburn store to a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a £125 glasses voucher.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“Hearing that I was shortlisted for my category was fantastic.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36707179.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/012-_Read-Only_%202.jpg","title":"revealed gcse league table for northern ireland 2018 where did your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts part of m1 reopened after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"facebook launches investigation into moderation of disturbing content","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

has launched an investigation into a contractor after it instructed its moderators not to remove extreme, abusive or graphic content from the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nCompany executives said they will review and change its processes and policies to make the social media site more safe and secure.\n\nNiamh Sweeney, Facebook Ireland head of public policy, told a parliamentary committee that suggestions the tech giant turns a blind eye to disturbing content were “categorically untrue”.\n\nIt came as Facebook apologised for allowing disturbing content to remain on its site.\n\nMs Sweeney and Siobhan Cummiskey, head of content policy of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, appeared before the Irish Communications Committee to answer questions about its content moderation policy of violent and harmful content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook executives, Niamh Sweeney (left) and Siobhan Cummiskey appeared before the Irish Communications Committee (Oireachtas TV/PA)\n\n\n\n\nA documentary on Britain’s Channel 4’s The Dispatches programme, Inside Facebook, used hidden-camera footage to show how content moderation practices are taught and applied within the company’s operations in Dublin.\n\nAn undercover reporter worked at Cpl Resources in Dublin, Facebook’s largest centre for Ireland and UK content.\n\nIt emerged in the investigation that Facebook moderators were instructed not to remove extreme, abusive or graphic content from the platform even when it violated the company’s guidelines.\n\nThis included violent videos involving assaults on children, racially charged hate speech and images of self-harm among underage users.\n\nMs Sweeney told the committee she and her colleagues were “upset” by what was reported in the programme.\n\n“If our services are not safe, people won’t share content with each other, and, over time, would stop using them,” she said.\n\n“Nor do advertisers want their brands associated with disturbing or problematic content, and advertising is Facebook’s main source of revenue.”\n\nFor six weeks the undercover reporter attended training sessions and filmed conversations in the offices.\n\nOne video showed a man punching or stamping on a screaming toddler.\n\nThe moderators marked it as disturbing and allowed it to remain online and used it as an example of acceptable content.\n\nMs Sweeney admitted disturbing content of violent assaults and racially-charged hate speeches that were allowed to remain on its platform was a betrayal of Facebook’s own standards.\n\nShe said the social media giant was not aware a video of a young toddler being assaulted by an adult was being used as an example to the type of content that was allowed to remain on its site.\n\n\n\nWe are in the process of an internal investigation to understand why some actions taken by Cpl were not reflective of our policies\nNiamh Sweeney, Facebook Ireland head of public policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“We understand that what I am saying to you has been undermined by the comments captured on camera by the Dispatches reporter,” Ms Sweeney said.\n\n“We are in the process of an internal investigation to understand why some actions taken by Cpl were not reflective of our policies and the underlying values on which they are based.”\n\nShe told the committee that Facebook is investing heavily in new technology to help deal with disturbing content.\n\nMs Sweeney also said the guidance given by trainers to its moderators were incorrect.\n\nThe committee heard that while the decision not to remove the video of the three-year-old was a mistake, there are a “narrow set of circumstances” in which Facebook would allow the video to be shared.\n\nShe explained this would happen if the child was still at risk, and there is a chance the child and perpetrator could be identified to law enforcement.\n\nHowever chair of the committee hearing, Hildegarde Naughton TD, said it was not acceptable that Facebook would be the “sole arbitraries” in relation to what can and cannot remain online.\n\n\n.\n@1Hildegarde\n: Social Media cannot regulate itself any longer\nhttps://t.co/bLgOCic5ih\n\n— Fine Gael (@FineGael) \nAugust 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\nShe said: “To say they will leave harmful, abusive and illegal material online to find the perpetrator is not acceptable and not acceptable to the people who see it online.\n\n“It’s up to the law enforcement agencies and up to Facebook to contact the relevant child protection agency, all of those procedures need to be set up.”\n\nAfter the programme was aired, Facebook said it has made changes to its processes and policies.\n\nThis includes flagging users who are suspected of being under the age of 13 and putting their accounts on hold while their policy on removing child abuse videos is also under review.\n\nMs Sweeney went on to say it is carrying out an internal investigation with Cpl to establish how the “gaps between our policies and values” and the training Cpl happened.\n\nThe staff at the centre of the Dispatches show were also “encouraged” to take time off.\n\nOther steps taken by the tech giant include retraining Cpl trainers, revising their training materials, introducing new quality control measures and holding an audit to identify any repeat failings by Cpl over the last six months.\n\nMs Sweeney added that while a number of issues were raised in the Channel 4 programme, their system was “working”.\n\nShe continued: “I wouldn’t like to say that the system is broken entirely. We have had some amount of success in regulating areas.”\n\nShe said their most effective has been in child sexual exploitation.\n\n“The vast majority people on Facebook don’t use it in the way we are listening to today,” she added.\n\n“They don’t encounter the type of people we are discussing.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"justin mcaleese faithbased objections have no place in secular marriage","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

said.\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/republic-of-ireland/justin-mcaleese-faithbased-objections-have-no-place-in-secular-marriage-37176761.html\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/incoming/article37176757.ece/9fd5b/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_d04b5cb3-15eb-470d-9716-f53a2753758c_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaith-based

[]).push({})\n\n\nIt is the only part of the UK in which what campaigners term marriage equality has not been legalised due to religious-inspired opposition from its largest party, DUP.\n\nJustin McAleese was a prominent campaigner in the Irish Republic’s watershed referendum campaign in 2015, when he discussed his experience growing up as a gay man.\n\nMr McAleese said he had a “huge problem” with the level of leadership in the Catholic Church but urged advocates of change to engage in difficult conversations with those who think differently.\n\n\nCampaigner Justin McAleese (third from left) will address a Pride event in Belfast tonight. ⁦\n@PA\n⁩ \npic.twitter/msQYqz5wI0\n\n— michael mchugh (@mmchugh02) \nAugust 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe said: “Faith has no place in secular, registry office marriage.”\n\nThe campaigner attended an event in Belfast as part of the annual Pride festival.\n\nThe Democratic Unionists, Prime Minister Theresa May’s close allies, hold that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman and have used a parliamentary mechanism at Stormont to veto efforts to legislate in Northern Ireland.\n\nMr McAleese said the Church of Ireland and Catholic Church was entitled to its definition of marriage but should not be able to force that view on everyone else in the secular world.\n\nHe said: “Coming at this debate through the prism of one definition of marriage from the tradition of religion is simply not good enough when you are talking about civil registry office marriage in secular Northern Ireland.”\n\nHe added: “We need to talk about marriage… one kind of marriage, everyone equal, that would be progress.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin McAleese, second left, with his mother Mary, second right (PA)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the now-suspended Stormont Assembly was operating its members voted in favour of change, while public opinion polls show a majority of above 70% back social liberalisation.\n\nFormer president Mary McAleese was an outspoken advocate for same-sex marriage during Ireland’s referendum campaign which saw such unions legalised.\n\nHer son Justin has said he wanted to win a seat in the next Irish general election.\n\nHe called for a proper debate around sexual health and education in the Republic, claiming the authorities were “away behind” on addressing some of these issues.\n\n“You should leave school knowing how you can ensure your own sexual health.\n\n“There is a lot of work to be done but nothing has happened since the referendum.”\n\n\nToday we have announced our support for civil marriage equality in NI: \nhttps://t.co/QiWj44IcXe\n We believe everyone is different but equal \u0026 marriage equality should be a right regardless of sexual orientation \n@barnardos\n \n#BelfastPride\n \n#bproud2018\n \n@belfastpride\n \n#LGBT\n+ \npic.twitter/qGgTWlcrqn\n\n— Barnardo\u0027s NI (@BarnardosNI) \nAugust 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Barnardo’s became the first children’s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nWith devolved government at Stormont remaining in suspension since January 2017, earlier this year Labour MP Conor McGinn tried unsuccessfully to force the policy through Westminster via a private members bill.\n\nKoulla Yiasouma, Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, said: “It is clear the current situation in terms of same sex marriage in Northern Ireland is untenable and legislation needs to be enacted as soon as possible to address this discrimination and its direct and indirect effect on children and young people.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"part of a human ear discovered on a dublin street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n
