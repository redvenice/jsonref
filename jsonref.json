Sometimes I’ll cut what I can to make her feel better, but it’s usually just one or two long pieces.’Evelyn did not have any hair when she was born and her straw-like strands didn’t start growing in until two months before her first birthday.(Picture: Nicole CubbedgeCaters News)Her mum said: ‘She was bald as a baby and her hair didn’t even start growing until she was about ten months old.‘From the first day that it grew in, it just stuck straight up and she didn’t have a full head of hair until she was two years old.’Nicole tries putting Evelyn’s hair in a pony tail with hairspray, but even that doesn’t keep it from sticking up for long.Though Evelyn understands that her hair is different to most, it doesn’t bother much.Nicole said: ‘She’s starting to realize the difference between her hair and everyone else’s, but it doesn’t phase her much.‘Sometimes she sees the other girls’ hairstyles and wishes that hers could look the same.’And for the time being, Evelyn’s family is going to keep her hair how it is, and will continue to encourage her to love her uniqueness.Nicole said: ‘It’s what makes her unique. We’re not going to do anything about it unless it bothers her more as she gets older.’MORE: 9 things you never knew about gin botanicals and their health-boosting propertiesMORE: Sex is still important when you’re over 65"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10483187.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"nasa launches spacecraft bound mars","story":"The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas-V rocket with the NASA InSight spacecraft onboard (Picture: EPANasaBill Ingalls)Nasa has launched a spacecraft bound for Mars, the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the West Coast of America.The Mars InSight lander launched Vandenberg Air Force Base in California today to explore the mysterious insides of the red planet.Facebook \u0027to consider monthly fee to use add-free version of site\u0027It will take more than six months for the spacecraft to complete its 301 million mile journey and start its unprecedented geologic excavations.The lander will dig deeper into Mars than ever before – nearly 16 feet, or 5 meters – to take the planet’s temperature.It will also attempt to make the first measurements of marsquakes, using a seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface.It is the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the West Coast of America (Picture: Bill IngallsNASA via AP)The Atlas V (five) rocket holds a pair of mini satellites meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration.The robotic geologist – armed with a hammer and quake monitor – will drill deep into the crust where it will explore the rumblings of Mars in a bid to uncover the secrets of its ancient history.Once settled, the solar-powered craft will spend one Martian year – two Earth years – plumbing the depths of the planet’s interior for clues to how Mars took form and, by extension, how the Earth and other rocky planets came into being.While Earth’s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars – about one-third the size of Earth – is believed to have remained relatively static for more than 3 billion years, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes over the course of the mission, producing data that will help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet’s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it and the outermost layer, the crust.InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a Mars lander designed to study the ‘inner space’ of Mars (Picture: Bill IngallsNASA via Getty Images)MORE: Someone smuggled 50 crocodiles on a UK-bound flightMORE: Facebook ‘to consider monthly fee to use add-free version of site’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10491038.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"someone smuggled 50 crocodiles uk bound flight","story":"They were destined for a farm in Cambridgeshire, where they were to be bred for their meat.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.          Pictured: The rear view of York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk complete with conservatory\u0027It\u0027s not too late!\u0027 Meghan Markle\u0027s brother Thomas pens...Royal Wedding: The American traditions Meghan Markle will be...Share this articleThere were not enough bathrooms and nobody had an en-suite. Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/07/4BCB952700000578-0-image-m-15_1525327815445.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

Czech Republic president Milos Zeman (pictured) is known for his pro-Kremlin viewsMeanwhile, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent were used in the attack on Skripal and his daughter Yulia.Ahmet Uzumcu told the New York Times the amount of Novichok used - around half a cup of liquid - suggests it was created for use as a weapon rather than for research purposes.Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were left fighting for their lives in hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4.The inquiry into the nerve agent attack in the Wiltshire city has involved 250 detectives who have gone through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and interviewed more than 500 witnesses.Mr Uzumcu told the paper the Novichok could have been applied as a liquid or aerosol.He said: \u0027For research activities or protection you would need, for instance, five to 10 grams or so, but even in Salisbury it looks like they may have used more than that, without knowing the exact quantity, I am told it may be 50, 100 grams or so, which goes beyond research activities for protection.\u0027It\u0027s not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse.\u0027He added the samples collected suggested the nerve agent was of \u0027high purity\u0027.          Moscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze. Army officers are pictured removing the bench where the Skripals collapsedMoscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze.The Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko previously suggested that Sergei and Yulia Skripal may have been injected by British authorities with nerve agent produced at Porton Down.However the UK has previously stated its conviction that only Russia had the means and motive to target the former spy.Karen Pierce, the UK\u0027s representative to the United Nations, told a meeting last month there was \u0027no plausible alternative explanation than Russian State responsibility for what happened in Salisbury\u0027, suggesting Russia had the ability, operation experience and motive to carry out the attack.

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BB4F23700000578-5691219-image-a-71_1525436953731.jpg","title":"Who Candace Owens Kanyes favorite free thinker","story":"    After being praised on Twitter, Candace Owens and her boss Charlie Kirk secured a meeting with Kanye West and the trio met in CaliforniaReturning to the social media platform after a breakdown in 2016, Kanye tweeted: ‘I love the way Candace Owens thinks,’ and followed up this tweet with one reading ‘Only free thinkers.’Frank Ocean parodied this tweet by posting: ‘I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.’ But who is Candace Owens?Who is Candace Owens?Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Candace is an American writer and conservative commentator.While she was in high school, she received a number of racist phone calls that were later traced to a car in which the son of Governor Dannel Malloy was present.Candace’s family sued the Stamford Board of Education and won a $37,500 settlement.

Gorton, Eddie Hausner, Paul Hosefros, Bob Klein, Larry Morris, Gary Settle and Joyce Dopkeen, who was the first woman hired as photographer for The New York Times. \u0027These were really top notch photojournalists who were combining a sort of documentary sort of feel but were also sort of combining artistic sensibility. The photos are all color which is good because, I suppose the predominant motive of photographing at that time would have been black and white,\u0027 Kuhn said.It\u0027s unclear how long they worked for the Parks Department or how much they were paid.

You know, I guess the subways are another venue where everyone is brought together in a different way, but in these pictures clearly represent to some extent a revolving demographic of New York. But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity,\u0027 Kuhn added. The above image shows the Fiesta Folklorica at the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, Manhattan. This is one image in the collection where it\u0027s unclear which photographer captured this historic moment          Joyce Dopkeen, the first woman hired as a photographer for The New York Times, captured the above image of park revelers at park in the Bronx. For years she worked as the only female photographer for the newspaper          The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park. Photographer Gary Settle captured the above image showing a woman happily holding her shoes while walking in the water at the Unisphere inside Flushing Meadows Corona Park in QueensThe New York City Parks and Recreation Department employs their own staff photographers who go out each day and capture images inside the city\u0027s parks. But those images are \u0027more official and show construction or playgrounds or openings and so forth,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So these images from the Times photographers are very different,\u0027 he added. \u0027I\u0027ve always been intrigued by how parks represent our society at large.

But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity.\u0027Some are obvious and common, like people swimming at the beach, some are less common like cricket or a guy roasting a whole pig – which by the way is not a legal thing to do in the park.\u0027The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park.          Kuhn noted: \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978.\u0027 Photographer D. Gorton captured the above image of a boy petting a cat during the Cats on Parade inside the Central Park Mall in Manhattan          Photographer Paul Hosefros snapped this image of two boys playing handball at Seven Gables Playground in Queens          Photographer Paul Hosefros captured the above image of a young woman resting after swimming at Red Hook Pool in Brooklyn          Photographer Ed Hausner captured the above image showing a family trying to salvage a picnic table inside of an unidentified park One of the many captivating images in the exhibit shows a little boy barefoot and sitting on an abandoned ing board at an empty pool in Red Hook.\u0027The pool is filled with liter, wood and debris and this boy climbed up onto the ing platform barefoot, which I don\u0027t think we would let someone do this today,\u0027 Kuhn stated.\u0027Clearly this picture tells you a lot. It\u0027s saying that this place was no longer fulfilling its function, it\u0027s telling you that there was no body minding the pool at the time and that they let a young kid in. And yet he\u0027s sort of there sucking his thumb in this poignant picture.\u0027 Other images show women in their swimsuits walking along a boardwalk, children playing on a playground, teen boys running while playing handball and more. \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So the narrative I saw with the images though starkly was that here\u0027s this year considered one of the worst in the city\u0027s fiscal history, in terms of it\u0027s ability to manage itself, and yet people are still joyful in many of the pictures and engaging actively with their parks. \u0027Sort of creating a sense of that they are essential no matter what.\u0027 1978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project will be on show at Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"Six story deep sinkhole length two football fields opens New Zealand cow farm","story":"A sinkhole the length of two football fields and the depth of a six-story building has opened up on a New Zealand farm  A worker stumbled upon the chasm before dawn when he was rounding up cows for milking on the farm near the North Island town of RotoruaHe says the area often develops sinkholes due to degrading limestone rock beneath the ground\u0027s surface.GNS Science volcanologist Brad Scott told Newshub the sinkhole was three times larger than any he\u0027d seen before. He says an underground cavity would have developed over decades.Tremain says he\u0027s planning to install a fence so livestock don\u0027t fall into the sinkhole.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The narrowness of the target made a direct hit from the air almost impossible and even if it were, no conventional bomb dropped by the RAF would smash such immense structures.Nor were standard naval torpedoes of any use, since each dam wall was protected on its reservoir side by heavy netting.But one fertile mind was determined to solve the problem. He was English scientist and inventor Barnes Wallis, and his answer was a bouncing bomb.RAF Dambusters squadron loses its red, white and blue logo...Falklands hero\u0027s bravery medal and logbooks from iconic...Medals won by Dambusters hero whose plane was last out and...Share this articleAs a senior designer at the Vickers aircraft company, Wallis had already displayed his gift for invention before the war through his work on the R100, at its launch the largest airship in the world, and the Wellington bomber, whose innovative airframe, made of a lattice structure of interconnected metal beams, proved magnificently robust in combat.\u0027In my whole experience of aeronautical engineers and inventors, I have never come across one I consider more able,\u0027 says Fred Winterbotham, the Air Ministry\u0027s Director of Intelligence.Born in 1887 in Derbyshire, Wallis was the son of a doctor who contracted polio in middle-age, leaving him permanently disabled and his family in straitened circumstances.          Wallis himself was a brilliant child, not just in his academic studies but also in his talent for making models.At 12, he won a scholarship to the public school of Christ\u0027s Hospital in Horsham, yet he shunned the obvious path to university. He left school at 17 to become a marine engineer, a discipline that gave him a profound understanding of fluid dynamics and led Vickers to hire him as an airship designer in 1913. There he remained for the rest of his career.Although devoted to his work, Wallis was no lonely obsessive. He loved to play sport despite his short-sightedness, and he was happily married, producing four children.His daughter Mary, who inherited his need to wear glasses, married the son of Marie Stopes, the renowned birth control pioneer and fanatical eugenicist who was appalled at the match because she feared that her grandchildren would also have imperfect eyesight.Barnes Wallis, in true British fashion, had his eccentricities too. For breakfast he ate exactly three spoonfuls of porridge and eight prunes. When he arrived home in the evening, he always had a bowl of cold rice pudding.He also had a streak of arrogance, calling senior air staff officers \u0027singularly stupid\u0027 and boasting that \u0027it is the engineers of this country who are going to win the war\u0027.From late 1940, Wallis increasingly focused on dambusting. His first idea was to use a ten-ton \u0027earthquake bomb\u0027, which he theorised would crack the structure if dropped into the reservoir within 150 feet of the dam wall.Because there was no RAF bomber at the time which could carry such a load, he proposed building a huge new six-engined plane to be called the Victory. The scheme was rejected but Wallis did not give up.          The growing availability of the Avro Lancaster, the heavy bomber which entered RAF service in December 1941, was a boon to Barnes Willis and contributed to his successHe then turned to the concept of dropping a missile that could reach the dam in a series of ricochets, just as a stone skims across the surface when thrown with a low trajectory.He was partly inspired by the exploits of Horatio Nelson, whose ships extended their firing range by skimming their cannon balls off the water into the enemy. Wallis was also helped by his Vickers colleague George Edwards, a cricketer who explained how a ball imparted with backspin will have greater bounce.Using this information, Wallis began experiments at his Surrey home using an old washtub filled to the brim, a catapult and a set of children\u0027s marbles.\u0027We had to count the number of bounces and he would adjust the distance of the catapult,\u0027 recalled his daughter Mary.The results were encouraging enough for Wallis to continue. He was helped by two fortunate developments. The first was the growing availability of the Avro Lancaster, the heavy bomber which entered RAF service in December 1941.The Lancaster was ideal for an attack on the dams not only because, with its huge bomb bay designed for torpedoes, it had a greater loading capacity than any other RAF plane, but also because it was highly manoeuvrable, a vital quality for low-level flying.          The Lancaster was ideal for an attack on the dams  because of its huge bomb bay, great loading capacity and because it was highly manoeuvrableThe second development was the breakthrough made by the scientist A. R. Collins, an expert in concrete engineering from the Road Research Laboratory.Collins had also been analysing the dams problem and in scale test he found that the destructive effect of an underwater explosion was far greater if the bomb were in direct contact with the wall. Otherwise, the shockwaves from the blast risked being absorbed by the water.This discovery further emphasised the need to put backspin on the bomb to ensure it hugged the face of the dam.Wallis and Collins started to co-operate. With Government support, further successful experiments were conducted in the summer of 1942, in a large ship tank at Teddington and a disused dam in Wales.So positive were the findings that official approval was given for airborne tests, to be carried out at Chesil Beach on the Dorset coast in a Wellington bomber from December 1942.          Pictured is Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who was the brave leader of the Dambusters raid which earned the gratitude and admiration of the nationAt this stage, Wallis believed the bouncing bomb should be spherical. At first the Chesil tests went badly as the bomb shattered on impact with the water.Then, after further modifications, everything came together on 23 January 1943. Flying at 283 mph and an altitude of just 42 feet, the Wellington released the bomb, spinning at 485 revolutions per minute.It bounced 13 times without breaking up. Further tests were even more fruitful, one prototype reaching 1,315 yards.With the footage from Chesil Beach, Wallis pressed the air establishment to agree to equip Lancasters in advance of a full attack on the Ruhr dams.A decision was urgently required, since air intelligence revealed that the waters in the reservoirs would be at their peak in mid-May after winter and spring rains.Wallis ran into opposition from senior air figures. But rescue was at hand. The shrewd Chief of the Air Staff Sir Charles Portal, who had now seen Wallis\u0027s research, over-ruled the objections of his subordinates.The Dambusters raid carried a heavy price for the RAF, as 53 crewmen from 617 Squadron were killed in the attack.Wallis was shattered at this death toll. \u0027He was desolate for the rest of his life. They were his boys,\u0027 recalled his daughter Mary.When in 1951 he was given a grant of £10,000 by the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors for his war work, he handed it to Christ\u0027s Hospital in Horsham to set up a trust to educate the children of RAF personnel killed or injured in action.With the arrival of peace, the ideas continued to flow. Before he was forced to retire in 1971 at the age of 83, Wallis was involved in plans as various as swing-wing aircraft, hypersonic travel, large cargo submarines and radio telescopes. He was knighted in 1968.But it was the bouncing bomb for which he will always be remembered.In a touching letter to Roy Chadwick, designer of the Lancaster Bomber, just a week after the raid, Wallis said: \u0027May I offer you my very deep thanks for the existence of your wonderful Lancaster, for it was the only aircraft in the world capable of doing the job, and I should like to pay my tribute of congratulation and admiration to you, the designer.\u0027          The crew of 617 squadron\u0027s G board the Lancaster bomber, from left to right: Trevor-Roper, Pulford, Deering, Spafford, Hutchison, Guy Gibson, Taerum"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/05/13/4BDFFA9C00000578-5693961-The_97_tonne_plane_which_would_have_240_passengers_on_board_if_i-a-1_1525522962863.jpg","title":"Panicked residents plane fly just 2 000 feet test flight","story":"    An aeroplane\u0027s test flight flew as low as 2,000 feet over Bristol, sparking fears it was crashing          The 97-tonne plane, which would have 240 passengers on board if it was full, can be seen banking and flying low over treesThe plane, which will not complete any commercial flights until the end of 2018, flew low over Filton, Patchway and Almondsbury in South Glos on Thursday as part of a noise test.One of the videos posted on Facebook shows the plane moving slowly over the top of some houses while another shows it slanted to one side near some trees. One local resident said: \u0027Was so low to my mum\u0027s house, she was home alone and panicked.\u0027Caroline McMichael commented on Facebook: \u0027Not good for those who have anxiety.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

They also believe a white shroud will make it harder to spot on the skyline, sparking claims the tragedy could be forgotten.Instead they want it to be green, which is the colour that has been adopted by Grenfell survivors and campaign groups during vigils and marches, and on social media. Pulling down the sheeting and replacing it with a green one would cost up to £400,000, sources say.Officials had previously promised that the charred tower would be covered by early this year after psychologists warned that the sight of it was worsening the trauma of those living nearby.Scaffolding was put up in August – two months after the fire ripped through the building, killing 71. The first plastic sheets were put up in October and officials planned to cover up one floor every week.But the construction has been painfully slow and has stalled since the row erupted last month.

The anniversary is coming up and this is already a traumatic time for those affected by the fire. Now we will have to commemorate the dead with the charred remains still dominating the skyline. Once again, we have been ignored and neglected.’A group called Grenfell United – which represents many of those affected by the inferno – claims it asked for the shroud to be green back in December.It is understood to have copies of emails to officials proving this. A spokesman for the group said: ‘The tower should have been covered months ago.     The fire at Grenfell Tower in the Lancaster West Estate in North Kensington on June 14, 2017 caused 71 deaths and over 70 injuries\u0027Survivors, bereaved and the community agreed with the Government two things last year – that the tower would be covered and would be covered in green to reflect the wishes of the community and ensure that what happened would never be forgotten. \u0027Despite this agreement a white covering was put up without ever explaining why.\u0027Approaching the one-year anniversary the Government needs to resolve this quickly so that we can all keep moving forward with rebuilding our lives and our community.’Survivors voiced their concerns over the colour of the shroud in meetings last month with Home Office minister Nick Hurd.Last night a source close to him said: ‘He understands that there are concerns over the colour of the plastic sheeting and has met survivors to listen to their views.’Responsibility for the charred remains lies with a body called London Local Authority Gold.An LLAG spokesman said it has received some new proposals from the community recently and will ‘make a decision on the best way forward...in due course’.He added: ‘We continue to consult closely with the community.

The late comedian Linda Smith was born in the same town. She once said: “Erith has a suicide pact with Dagenham.” Dagenham is directly opposite Erith, on the north side of the Thames.My father was the managing director of an old-fashioned department store: Mitchells. Although I was often in Erith, we didn’t live there. Our house was in Barnehurst, a very ordinary outer London suburb a mile or so to the south. Erith is mentioned in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, when the protagonist sails past it on his way down the Thames at the start of his journey to Africa. As for Barnehurst in literature, the only thing I can think of is a poem of mine that refers to the bus depot and the Wimpy Bar in the adjacent parade of shops. There was some culture going on there during my childhood. My friend Dave Gelly, the jazz musician and writer, who grew up in the same area, told me that the Red Barn pub near Barnehurst station was the centre of the postwar revival of British jazz. I was entirely unaware of it.In Erith there was a theatre. I appeared there as a small child in a rabbit costume when my ballet class put on a performance. And we often went as a family to amateur operatic productions. The lasting result of this is my love of Gilbert and Sullivan. It wasn’t instant – at first I was often dragged along reluctantly. But as I became familiar with the tunes and old enough to appreciate the humour, I began to enjoy them. I’m still annoyed by people who are snooty about G\u0026ampS. Sullivan wrote wonderful tunes and Gilbert was a genius. He has certainly influenced my work. I’ve written several poems that borrow forms he used, most recently one called “At 70” that goes to the tune of the Major–General’s song from The Pirates of Penzance.Erith was not prospering in the 1950s. Its riverside location reduced the catchment area and many shoppers preferred its nearby rival, Bexleyheath. Mitchells closed down in 1960 and shortly afterwards the town was redeveloped. My parents moved away in 1963. When I visited Erith a few years later, it was unrecognisable. Barnehurst had remained stolidly the same.Although the family was based in the area until 1963, I only lived there full time until I was sent away to boarding school at the age of seven. After that it was just the school holidays. As a teenager I took advantage of the half-hour train journey to central London, where I would meet school friends and go to the theatre, most often the Old Vic.When I began writing poetry I was troubled by a vague feeling that a poet needed to have grown up in a beautiful rural environment, or at least somewhere exciting. Then I read Philip Larkin’s poem “I Remember, I Remember” about his childhood in Coventry, “where I did not invent  Blinding theologies of flowers and fruits”. His lines helped me to believe that maybe I could be a poet, despite having grown up in an unremarkable suburb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de93e2bb8e15114d970b1f9417fe0c842e0e2e41/0_67_5202_3122/master/5202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71d4c4a71dc1f58c275249c0c1703f2","title":"royal wedding prince harry meghan markle 80m economy","story":"Pubs, retailers and landlords hopeful of bumper weekend to celebrate Harry and Meghan Markle’s weddingThe royal wedding could provide a shot in the arm of more than £80m for the country’s slowing economy as retailers, pubs and hoteliers look to cash in on Harry and Meghan’s looming nuptials.The tourist authority VisitBritain said about 50,000 Americans were expected to be among the crowds lining the roads in Windsor and soaking up the atmosphere in the capital when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot later this month. Pubs have been given special permission to stay open late while retailers in London’s shopping district are anticipating a £60m mini sales boom on the back of tourist spending sprees.“There could be a modest boost to GDP growth in the second quarter from the royal wedding and the football World Cup starting in mid-June,” said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to economic forecasting group the EY Item Club. “There may well be a temporary boost to retail sales from people buying souvenirs and also to tourism.”Airbnb said that with around 42,000 guest arrivals expected in London, hosts were set to rake in £12m from renting out their properties. In Windsor residents can earn £353 from the wedding weekend alone by using Airbnb to let their properties. The couple’s decision to get married in the grounds of Windsor Castle had also turned Slough, Maidenhead and Reading into rental hot spots, the company said.The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship.News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating.\u0026nbspKensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.\u0026nbspMarkle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public.\u0026nbspMarkle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.\u0026nbspThe engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.”\u0026nbspMarkle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart.\u0026nbspIt emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace.\u0026nbspThe prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018.\u0026nbspMarkle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement.\u0026nbspClarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.With pub landlords given special permission to stay open until 1am on the eve of the nuptials, as well as on the day itself, the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association thinks the extended trading hours could deliver a £10m sales boost.“Relaxed licensing hours for pubs will be welcomed by pub-goers and provide a real boost to the pub trade,” said Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the BBPA – which represents the owners of 20,000 pubs. The wedding clashes with the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Chelsea, but while the wedding kicks off at noon the action does not start at Wembley until teatime – avoiding potential tussles over the big screen.Tim Martin, chair of JD Wetherspoon – which runs nearly 900 pubs, is less optimistic that the wedding will be good for business. “No disrespect to Harry and his missus but I can’t see the royal wedding moving the dial for the pub trade,” he said. “The public wish them all the best, but I feel the nuptials’ significance is overplayed.” There is optimism that the good weather ushered in by the bank holiday will hang around for the next fortnight: 19 May is too far away for the Met Office to have honed its forecast, but it warns that “confidence for a continuing warm dry spell is low” on its website. Online gambling firm Betway is offering odds of 1001 that the mercury will hit 100F (37.7C) on the big day.The country’s beleaguered retailers have been limbering up for the event since the engagement was announced at the end of last year with merchandise running the gamut from twee £12 tea-towels at John Lewis to Argos’s £14.99 rip-off of Markle’s engagement ring in cubic zirconia rather than diamonds.Markle has also been boosting the fortunes of British fashion retailers by mixing high street names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Jigsaw into her designer wardrobe for public engagements.The big supermarkets are also expected to benefit as Britons host street parties and use the event as an excuse for a get-together. It is not clear how many street parties are taking place nationwide but the figure is likely to be in the hundreds, with Hertfordshire county council alone reporting 51 applications. VisitBritain said the pomp and pageantry associated with the royal family was part of the country’s appeal to overseas visitors, with the bride’s nationality an added bonus because American visitors are the UK’s highest spending overseas group.“We are looking at it as a showcasing moment on TV stations around the world,” said VisitBritain director Patricia Yates. “Our history and heritage is a huge draw internationally and this is an opportunity to reach a younger audience with a contemporary story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"labour fudge brexit local elections leave remain corbyn","story":"It’s the May bank holiday weekend, and all is just as tradition demands. The sun is shining, the local election results are in, and Ken Livingstone is on the television talking about Hitler. To complete the spring picture, partisans and pundits are out in force, frantically spinning or interpreting the results of last night’s council contests in England, hoping to ine what the votes in 150 local authority areas portend for the nation’s future.So Tories can celebrate that not only did they hold on in key London boroughs that had seemed vulnerable, they also made gains outside the capital, from a bellwether like Redditch, in Worcestershire, and across the West Midlands, to Basildon and Peterborough. Labour can comfort itself with gaining Plymouth, and the fact that in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster it won more seats than at any time since 1986. But both parties would surely be wrong to read too much into any of these results, given that we’ve all seen how a completely different picture can emerge a matter of weeks later.Now, it’s true that you’d expect an opposition party to be trouncing a government in power for eight years and rocked by serial resignations, a visible inability to handle Brexit, and the shaming scandal of Windrush. But we know that Corbyn didn’t have the broadcast attention that clearly helped him last year, and that plenty of voters are simply not that engaged by local ballots. People may want to declare we’ve reached “peak Corbyn”, but it’s a stretch to do that on the basis of these results.Instead, you can make small, discrete observations about specific local situations. I’ll offer just one, related to the row over antisemitism in Labour. Plenty of those who’d always insisted the whole thing was invented, and a smear, also said that the mainstream Jewish organisations did not speak for the Jewish community when they sounded the alarm, that they were guilty of exaggerating the fears they claimed to represent, and that many Jews were, in fact, quite happy with Corbyn-led Labour. Well, now we have some pretty compelling data suggesting otherwise. In Barnet, but also in parts of Salford, Bury, Gateshead and Leeds, Jewish voters, including many who’d long backed Labour, told canvassers they could not vote for the party. And they didn’t.Labour’s base is more split, thriving with the younger, the more educated and the urban, many of whom are passionately anti-Brexit, while trying to hold on to older voters in post-industrial towns who backed leave with enthusiasm. There was more evidence of that fault line on Thursday, as Labour advanced in pro-remain Trafford but fell back in pro-leave Nuneaton and Derby.Until now, Labour has sought to ride these two horses at once, with the policy of “strategic ambiguity”. Last June it seemed to work, as Labour held on to its leave-voting seats even as it picked up remain strongholds like Canterbury and Kensington. But strategic ambiguity could be about to run out of road.The calculation here is not chiefly electoral, and certainly not based on these latest results. Rather it is based on both principle and practicality. Put simply, Labour will soon need to come off the Brexit fence – both because it should do and because it will have to.The practical urgency is that a series of Commons votes are looming in which Labour will have to take a clear stand. Even ahead of the crunch decisions in October, the Lords will vote on Tuesday on an amendment that would keep Britain in the single market. If that passes and comes before the Commons, would the Labour front bench move against it? If they did, what would their anti-Brexit supporters make of that: Labour acting to keep Britain out of the single market, with its protections of environmental and workers’ rights? The one option that won’t be available to the party leadership is more fudge.The principled case is more obvious. Labour is a pro-European party and understands that leaving both the single market and customs union would be a disaster for this country. It can argue that leaving the EU while staying in those institutions, in a kind of Norway-plus arrangement – with acceptance of free movement in principle, while working to modify its effects in practice, as other EU members do – would be a fair reflection of the 52-48 verdict of 2016. Out, but a little bit in.But wouldn’t that be electoral madness? What about all those leave areas represented by Labour MPs? As it happens, polls show that even among those Labour voters who backed leave, a plurality want Corbyn to commit to permanent membership of the customs union and single market. After all, breaking from those bodies was not on the ballot paper.Ambiguity served Labour well for a while. But it has outlived its usefulness and could soon become actively harmful, a worst-of-both-worlds position that pleases neither leavers nor remainers. Those who want Brexit will vote for the real thing, which means voting Tory those who oppose it will start looking around for a party that will do the same. In politics, “neither one thing nor another” has limited appeal: before long it begins to look a lot like nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef18c212914acb3793cd11af8e5ea4baaf0838/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a2ece390669cfd242d33f11af29318c","title":"identity politics veered ideals kimberly foster","story":"A misuse of identity is not just a conservative problem – it affects well-meaning people on the left, tooIdentity politics have become a convenient scapegoat for the deepening political isions in the United States. Though evidence for the claim is thin, detractors blame Hillary Clinton’s presidential loss on her choice to provide a platform for discussions of identity and inequality during her campaign.In the months leading up to 8 November 2016, Clinton differentiated herself from her opponent by becoming the candidate who cared about America’s underserved groups: women, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, black and Latino voters, and the many people whose identities  multiple categories. Her supporters rallied behind the Big Tent slogan: “Love Trumps Hate.” But on election day, it did not. In an interview with 60 Minutes last fall, Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for the White House and chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, warned, “The longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em.”A skittish left might view Bannon’s words as an imminent threat. But identity politics are not to be feared. Their effectiveness as a progressive political strategy, however, is undermined by their misuse.When a group of black feminists called the Combahee River Collective coined the phrase “identity politics” in 1977, they imagined that the “seemingly personal experiences of inidual Black women’s lives” would provide the foundation for a politics that is “actively committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression”. Their ideology began with self, but it was not self-obsessed. Ultimately, they knew their work would benefit everyone.Since then, identity politics have veered away from Combahee’s foundational ideals. We should return to them, not to appease the right wing but to reaffirm the importance of a progressivism that touts liberty and justice for all. Identity politics become flimsy when they devolve into shallow back-and-forths that conflate lived experience with sound political analysis. A worldview that moves us closer to equality doesn’t stem from living in a certain kind of body. It emerges from pursuing a certain kind of politics.When identities can be invoked to assert an unquestionable authority, marginalized people can get by making dubious or completely false claims because of their “lived experience”.As secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, has endorsed delays of anti-discrimination regulation in housing and called poverty “a state of mind”. Carson, himself, grew up impoverished in Detroit. He documented his journey to becoming a renowned neurosurgeon in a widely read autobiography, Gifted Hands. Because of his personal story, Carson is held up, by himself and his supporters, as a testament to the supreme importance of hard work. But the belief that grit is the key to escaping poverty is contradicted by decades of social science research. Poverty persists because of a crumbling social safety net not a culture of dependency.Carson’s anecdotes are compelling, in part, because our lives do matter. Marginalized people gain a unique insight into systemic inequality because we face it every day. For too long those stories have been doubted or dismissed by claims that only an “objective” or “dispassionate” viewpoint can be trusted.But lived experience is one form of knowledge that should be considered alongside others, and stories are most useful when assessed within a broader context of structural inequity. The Combahee River Collective argued that one’s political consciousness colors how one will interpret life events thus, similar experiences can lead similarly situated people to draw ergent conclusions. For example, every black American who grew up like Carson and went on to be successful will not share his views. In fact, based on the racial makeup of the Republican party, most do not. So sweeping generalizations about the lives of oppressed people that are backed up only by stories of iniduals should always be interrogated because so many of those conclusions collapse when examined more closely.A misuse of identity is not just a conservative problem. In the #MeToo era, women are empowered to call on their experiences with bias and sexual assault and create change within industries that facilitate abuse. But those traumas are not a pass for women to avoid difficult questions about the substance of their activism. Actor Rose McGowan emerged as a sexual assault activist in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal that upended Hollywood’s silence on the mistreatment of actresses. When a trans woman confronted McGowan about her past transphobic comments at a book event, she responded angrily. On Twitter she charged that the audience and her staff failed to protect her during the exchange, and she refused to apologize for the statements. Instead, the actor-turned-author cancelled the rest of the book tour. Though McGowan’s identities as a woman and a victim of sexual assault are central to her activism, using them to shut down criticism is unproductive for the movement she advocates. Trans women are also victims of discrimination in employment, housing and healthcare, and an inclusive feminism must invest itself in recognizing all who are vulnerable. These sorts of oversights are easily correctable if acknowledged, but treating identities as credentials discourages critical self-reflection.Thoughtful conversations and meaningful activism require a measure of openness that the current paradigms for identity politics don’t always allow. We have to make sure that our exchanges do not reproduce oppressive power dynamics, but every challenge is not oppressive. An identity politics that is not principally concerned with dismantling all forms of inequality quickly devolves into a never-ending game of oneupmanship where self-satisfaction is all that’s won.For marginalized people, our power comes from seeing identity as a starting point, not the end.

It begins filming next year.“It’s a series I’ve wanted to make for a long time because I think the porn industry is a really interesting environment through which to look at power and how we behave in the workplace,” Kirkwood told the Observer. “It’s not a simple subject and I found the grey areas, such as the fact that it’s one of the few workplaces where women earn more than men and one of the few industries that allows women to juggle work and childcare demands, really fascinating.”Jolene is a mother of three who has built a two-decade career in the industry. “She’s not quite Jenna Jameson, but she has a following,” Kirkwood explained, referring to the prolific American star known as “the queen of porn”. Jolene finds her world turned upside down after coming into contact with a younger woman, Amy, an aspiring dancer who turns to porn while recovering from an injury.“I wanted to look at the way the industry has changed in recent years – there’s a very high turnover of actors working very intensely over a short period now, and that obviously has had a seismic effect,” Kirkwood said. “Jolene considers herself a very maternal person, not only to her own children but also in the way she looks after other women on set, and one of the things that the series considers is how women take care of other women and the culture of complicity and silence that can occur. What it means if you fail to stand up for someone or listen to them when they tell you what has occurred.“It’s also not a straightforward series. The quality of writing on television these days means that you can’t deal in cardboard cutouts. I wanted people to be sympathetic to these characters, but for questions to also be raised.”Kirkwood, whose plays Chimerica and The Children have won multiple awards, researched the subject by talking to industry performers and directors as well as feminist anti-porn campaigners. The writer has a reputation for tackling difficult subjects, from geopolitics and particle physics to sex trafficking, and stressed that the industry’s darker side wouldn’t be ignored. “It’s a subject about which I have all manner of feelings,” she said. “It’s easy to just get angry about porn and the way in which it affects lives, but I don’t think it’s very helpful to simply dismiss another woman’s lived experience in that way.“It’s one thing to sit in a bar and argue abstractly about how porn affects us and quite another to talk to a woman whose life this is. I wanted to look at that sympathetically but not softly. I don’t think this is a subject that you can simply take a single strident position on. There’s a lot to be said about how porn is the product of a capitalist mindset and will always have people who, out of necessity or out of choice, are willing to provide it.”The series is sure to draw comparisons with The Deuce, a period piece by David Simon, the creator of The Wire, about the growth of the porn industry in New York in the 70s, although Kirkwood stressed that she had a slightly different focus in mind.“I really admire the way in which The Deuce focuses on the economy and the way in which it drives the porn industry and it’s interesting how little has really changed in the most basic sense once you remove the changes in technology,” she said. “But in some senses comparing the British porn industry to the American porn industry is like comparing the British film industry to Hollywood. There’s a sense that it’s less mechanised and more of a cottage industry in Britain and I wanted to reflect that.”Most of all though she hopes that Adult Material will force audiences to look at the industry in a fresh way. “It’s a story about women navigating their way through a difficult and constantly changing world and I hope that if anyone is dismissive of porn actresses at the beginning then they will reconsider that by the end,” she said. “What I would love is for everyone to feel that the industry has been fairly represented, but also that watching it you have been pushed into areas that you might not always want to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a35926c08e4137460045c2f3d6345f19d5ba781/0_15_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35607ab2ae5955e226c045f897c93720 930w","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040.”The motor industry responded angrily to the news, saying it was disappointed to see policy being communicated by leaks.Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports.“We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance.”When the 2040 ban was announced last summer, shortly after a similar plan by France, the UK government declined to be drawn on whether it covered hybrids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1cdb9b79a1c875dfcfbf2e9334b69c6e7161ad2/423_1872_3097_1858/master/3097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9052ecebcfae5870d22524cd7cf72e9","title":"sean penn some of my best laughs have come out of the worst reviews","story":"The actor turned author speaks his mind about critics, ‘arrogant’ aid work, the ‘mania-led’ #MeToo movement, and why Madonna finds him boring. By Emma BrockesSean Penn walks into a low-key restaurant not far from his house and slides undetected into a seat at the back. It is a misty day in Malibu, 15 miles north of LA, and the actor appears in familiar, I-don’t-care guise: beat-up leather jacket, brushfire hair (which, in light of the views he will air about female vanity in Hollywood, I feel bound to report may be more vibrant than nature intended), with the jittery energy of a man who has stood for too long next to very loud speakers. The 57-year-old greets me affably, to my surprise: while Penn may be long admired for his acting, he is denigrated for almost everything else. He is known to be pugnacious, short-tempered, long-winded, a man who yells at photographers and smokes on TV. And now he has written a lunatic novel. “It’s the most fun I’ve had professionally,” he croaks and leans back in his chair.A few days before our meeting, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff was the subject of a full-page newspaper ad in which the publishers, rather cleverly, ran lines from the book’s worst reviews and asked readers to make up their own minds. The novel, which follows the adventures of its eponymous hero as he goes around selling septic tanks and murdering old people, is a satire of American consumer culture and the cult of image, and for weeks its excesses have been gleefully documented. Penn writes as if every word has been put through a thesaurus: for “face”, read “dermal mask” for “quiet”, “lingering symphony of silence” a man with good hearing has “extraordinary auditory augmentation efficiency”. So it goes on, until we reach: “Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.”Was he edited?“He wasn’t looking to change anything,” Penn says cheerfully. “But he did send me great notes which said, ‘I don’t understand this. Do you want me to?’” (In most cases Penn replied “yes” in some, “not so much”.) The suggestion he was indulged because of his celebrity is one he finds baffling. “No, because I wouldn’t have done it any other way. When people listen to the advice they get, it usually robs the soul of the piece. In the movies, they’re not thinking about whether it has impact on them they’re thinking about whether it will impact the box office.”This rather quaint view of publishing – as an industry devoid of commercial principles and certainly not the kind of business that might judge a book by a famous actor to have greater value as a car crash than as something more credible – is the main source of Penn’s enthusiasm for novel writing, which he sees as a less mediated form of expression than acting. But why would he trade in something he is indisputably world class at – Penn has won two Oscars, for Milk and Mystic River – for something he is indisputably not? The answer is burnout, what he calls “my great source of alienation from my peers, actors who would rather sell a movie than make one”. Where these actors are “brands”, and where even a movie he loves “is the sum of compromises at its best”, Bob Honey, by contrast, is “all mine. It’s been said you never complete a film, you abandon it, and I didn’t abandon this. I stand by every line exactly how I wrote it.”Has he seen the worst reviews? “I have a sense of them. It’s keep-your-day-job shit. A bunch of children, schadenfreude, whatever. And in the end, some of the best laughs I’ve got have been the one-liners that have come out of the worst reviews.”Through long espousal of leftwing politics, including vocal protests against the Iraq war and support of Hugo Chávez and Raúl Castro, Penn is used to being unpopular. Does it hurt to be mocked? “Well, mocked means the person’s an idiot.” Penn smiles crookedly and shutters his lids. “I’m not vulnerable at all.”There are two images of Sean Penn that rival the memory of his greatest screen roles. Up there with Carlito’s Way, or Dead Man Walking, or his role as Harvey Milk – the 2008 biopic of California’s first gay elected official and a performance for which one could almost forgive Penn any amount of bad behaviour off-screen – there is the shot of him in a boat rescuing survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and the one of his handshake with Mexican drug lord El Chapo.The gung-ho activism is more complicated and, on closer inspection, much more admirable than the caricature suggests. If there is precedent for Penn wading into a job about which he knows nothing and nailing it through sheer bloody-mindedness, it is here, in his experiences with aid.In 2010, Penn went to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake and set up the JP Haitian Relief Organization, an agency that has, by all accounts, been enormously successful and helped thousands of Haitians find shelter and medical relief. In a piece in the New York Times in 2011, by which time Penn had been in Haiti for almost a year, veteran aid workers lined up to praise him. The question of what he was doing in Haiti in the first place has roots in his inability to find equilibrium at home. The most persuasive passages in Bob Honey are those in which Penn writes of his character’s insomnia. When I ask if this comes from experience, he takes a big breath. “So this goes back as far as I, or my mother, can remember. I was born at 3.45am and I generally fall asleep at 3.45am. I’ve been to Zen centres, done sleep studies, everything. I could never get myself to go to sleep. I’d get up, sometimes, with no sleep at all. And I was getting older, so I wasn’t able to push through this thing mentally.” Eventually a doctor prescribed Ambien: “But it doesn’t work like it used to. It doesn’t keep me asleep, but I get to sleep and at least get three hours. Then you’re watching the clock for the time you have to get up, and it’s getting closer and closer.”Some of Penn’s wilder behaviour makes more sense, perhaps, when looked at in the context of a man who has never had more than three unbroken hours’ sleep.“Yuh. Judgment issues,” he says, raising his eyebrows in what is almost certainly a reference to the time, in 2009, when a court made him attend anger management classes after an altercation with a photographer.It probably didn’t improve your temper, I suggest.“No. Nor the thoughts that lead to a temperamental response.”One result of this is that Penn often feels himself to operate best in crisis mode. He quotes a line from Cutter’s Way, a movie from 1981 starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard in which a woman kills herself to get away from her alcoholic husband, and the final line of which is: “You know, the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy, I take straight.”“There’s been a lot of that in my life,” Penn says and he relates it, obliquely, to how he is able to function effectively in a destabilised environment such as Haiti after the earthquake. “I think tragedy can also be urgency. I find myself going calm, and being demanding. I can bring an American arrogance to anywhere in the world.” He smiles. “Look, in the movie business you tell your crew: ‘I need this set done yesterday.’ When I got to Haiti and I saw how NGOs worked, it would be like: ‘This patient needs this, now, and this is the person to get in touch with.’ Then I had six other people asking me six other things. When I circled back half an hour later to the first one and said, ‘Did you get it?’ they said, ‘We’re waiting for a response, we sent an email.’ I said, ‘You sent an email? Give me your phone, I’m going to call.’ And it drove me fucking mad.”Pretty quickly, Penn’s outfit became known as an agency that got things done quicker than the NGOs and he calls it “the easiest kind of work to do in an emergency, because it’s emergency related”. It was triage. He nods. “It’s the easiest, commonsense work. There’s a kid in the street, a truck’s going to hit it, do you know that the sidewalk is clear of paedophiles? No. I’ll make my apologies later.”It is fascinating that the self-important urgency of a Hollywood movie set can be translated to a disaster zone, but think about it, Penn says: “It’s the same business, the stakes are higher.” There’s even overlap with the sanitation logistics of shooting a movie. “You’ve gotta get porta potties for people.”Was he surprised when allegations were made last year that aid workers, including Roland Van Hauwermeiren, the head of Oxfam in Haiti, used sex workers? “I don’t know why it wasn’t a bigger scandal earlier. I was reading about it in the Haitian press when I was in Haiti in the beginning. Roland Van Hauwermeiren was probably the best country director of an organisation there. Of course, you’re not the best anything if you’re looking the other way on that stuff. Or, worse yet, if you’re participating.”In his own organisation, Penn had a policy of “no tolerance” right down to the rule that “if you smoke one joint, you’re fired”. In fact he ended up relaxing the drugs rule for his indigenous workers, because “how am I controlling that when my local workers went back to their homes at night? I stopped being an idiot with that.” For the imports, mostly Americans or Brits, however, “You don’t come to this country to break its laws.”And when someone in his organisation did break a rule? Well, Penn says, “There’s no organisation, including my own, where you don’t have something happen. And you deal with it you certainly want to take it transparent.” The cover-up, he says, is the biggest problem. “I’ve known of situations where big organisations discovered something and did an investigation, and fired somebody – and because they didn’t want a lawsuit from that person, another organisation would hire them it’s like passing on priests. In our organisation, I’d get on the phone to whoever the violator was and say, ‘If I hear you are ever trying to get a job in one of these organisations, I’m coming to your home town, and I’m going to rent out the movie theatre and show a documentary about you and make sure your parents are there.’”Why does he think an aid worker, who presumably starts out with good intentions, gets to the point of exploiting desperate women this way? “I can have theories,” Penn says, “but they’re the same theories one would apply to someone who abuses their children. How do you do that?”In light of these life-or-death stakes, Penn is unsympathetic to what he seems to regard as more trivial abuses closer to home, particularly those involving celebrity exposure. A week before we meet, he appeared in the gossip columns for dining with Charlie Rose, the disgraced former TV host fired from PBS and CBS for inappropriate behaviour around female staff. Penn is not, it is safe to say, on board with #MeToo, which he describes as “not intellectually honest”, “a movement led by mania” and full of “self-aggrandisement and venting”. At the end of Bob Honey, he writes a poem defending Charlie Rose and appearing to lament the demise of Louis CK.Clearly, I say, Penn thinks his friend was mistreated.“He says one thing happened other people said another thing happened. I wasn’t there. What I do think is we maybe should be very careful for example, are we now going to say we will never celebrate Thomas Jefferson again: slave holder, that’s all you are? Charlie Rose provided one of the only sophisticated dialogue programmes, and I don’t know what the percentages are, but I know that there are some lies that have been told publicly about people I know of some serious omissions. I’m talking about women towards men.” This is a personal issue for Penn, who in 2016 won a court-appointed apology from the director Lee Daniels, who erroneously implied the actor was guilty of domestic violence.Romantic relationships don’t seem to be Penn’s strong point. The worst bits of Bob Honey are those involving the character’s ex-wife, a harridan called Helen, about whom he is so vicious, I had wondered whether Penn’s own ex-wife might have commented on it. Penn gives me a dry look. “Which ex-wife?” he says.Oh. I had momentarily forgotten about Madonna, to whom Penn was married from 1985 to 1989. “The mother of your kids,” I say. (Penn and Robin Wright, who were married for 14 years, have Dylan and Hopper, both in their 20s.)“No these characters are amalgamations of a lot of things and she’s not a character in the book.” Penn pauses. “I don’t think the book would be either one of my ex-wives’ cup of tea. They both thought that I talked too much in ways that were too complicated.” He laughs. “I don’t have a lot of conversations with my most recent ex, but my first ex, we have a close friendship.”What does he think Madonna would say about the book? “I think if she was reading it, she’d say, ugh, I’ll read this some other time.”Anyway, Penn says, returning to the subject of #MeToo, “I don’t ever want to be in a movement. I don’t trust any movement. The anti-war movement did not sustain. We’re back in wars.”There is a libertarian streak in Penn that is impossible to miss. I repeat a wince-making line from Bob Honey, which Penn almost certainly considers to be a liberal statement: “Getting older in America is tough on a woman seeing what she’ll do to avoid it is tough on a man.” I assume Penn approved of Frances McDormand’s unadorned style at the Oscars this year?He takes a big breath: “When my kids were growing up, there was a thing called the surgery channel and I would watch this thing and get into hysterical laughter. One slice and you’re a human body! We’re the fucking same! But where I really became a giggling 12-year-old girl was volunteering for cosmetic surgery: you have someone who’s anaesthetised, and they’re doing the most vile things to them, and I would get so hysterical. You bring up Frances McDormand. What do you do to be more beautiful than that? That fucking woman walks into a room and you don’t know if you want to kiss her, eat her farts or bite her toes off, you just want to be around that energy.” As opposed, he says, to “the vanity that errs on the side of violence against oneself, physical violence. It’s crazy.”Does he understand why his countrymen voted for Trump?“I have a pretty good idea. We became celebritised,” he says. “I don’t buy People magazine. But when people complain that someone took a picture of them or that their privacy is being invaded, I’m like, yeah? Fuck you. I just spent my entire adult life with you telling me that because I want to express myself as an actor, that that comes with the territory. Well, it comes with the territory for you, now, and you bought those fucking People magazines. You made that happen.” He is jabbing his finger at me across the table. “When I go like this, I’m not at my best,” he says. “So two sides that are not at their best, it gets very shallow.” Penn has a disdain for the idea of the personal brand. “Branding is being! Branding is being! The algorithm of modern binary existentialism,” he writes in Bob Honey, a line I read out to him now.“Yeah,” says Penn, lowering his eyes and looking sage.What does “the algorithm of modern binary existentialism” mean? He snaps his eyes open. “Well. Binary – two components. When you’re taking an algorithm that’s going to identify the two components, and, there are, I think I talk about in the book also… it’s America today.” There follows a long story about how easy it is to buy components for a bomb in the US.“I’ve just gone off on the word binary. But I think it’s self-explanatory, in there. Huh.”Anyway, he says, the reason people voted for Trump is “because I think there’s a mental health problem in this country. It’s rage over reason. There’s a lot going on that was going on in Nazi Germany we’re finding scapegoats, groups to hate, whether it be of a race, or so-called lefty Hollywood, so that’s part of why I want to write something – I only have my sense of humour to offer. I didn’t want to just be angry all the time.”And he isn’t. There is an underlying humour to Penn’s rants that is often lost in translation and while I find much of what he says preposterous, arrogant and occasionally delusional, to my surprise, I also find him likable and funny – a genuine American eccentric.As we get up to leave, I can’t help laughing. “Sorry. I keep thinking about the fact that Madonna thought you were boring.”“I love her,” Penn says, and laughs. Is she a good egg? “Such a good egg.”We go outside to his pick-up truck and he introduces me to Flyboy, his six-month-old golden retriever. After Penn has gone, I call a friend with a degree in philosophy. “Does ‘the algorithm of modern binary existentialism’ mean anything?” I ask. After the laughter has died down, he says, “I think he means… in modern life everything is black and white. But existentialism refers to a specific tradition in philosophy he surely just means existence.” No matter Penn has a lot more to say. Before leaving he told me: he is hard at work on Bob Honey, the sequel. • Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff by Sean Penn is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster at £14.99.

The defeat left the manager questioning whether his players were as desperate as he is to secure a top-two finish.“It was not good enough,” said Mourinho, who had made six changes to his lineup and asked those selected to impress before the FA Cup final. “The players who replaced others did not perform at a good level and, when iniduals do that, it is difficult for the team to play well. “Maybe now you will not ask me why A, B and C do not play so much. People always ask: ‘Why always Lukaku?’ Well, now they know why always Lukaku, and why always this player and why always that player. We are probably not as good as people think we are inidually.“I knew what was going to happen, and I told them, but that is what we got. Brighton had one target, to get the point and celebrate their Premier League survival. Our target was to get points to help us finish second and they clearly showed that, for them, it is more important for them to stay in the Premier League than for us to finish second. They showed it from the first minute and we didn’t show that. We were not able to motivate ourselves.”Mourinho added: “For me that’s always disappointing because that’s not me. And if my players want to be honest and fair, which I think they want ... if you ask them they will tell you how long I spoke ... during the week, trying to anticipate the scenario and trying to persuade them that the only way to compete against a team like Brighton is to have the same commitment and ambition they have. “We were not ready to prove that second position is important for us. I am disappointed because second is important for me. I’m not sure every one of my players is disappointed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c1e5feeb84c3b4e495090631ba42f62222c315/0_117_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd2e9f927d25f0e2f5d24c281c2029f6","title":"stoke crystal palace premier league match report","story":"Exactly a decade ago on Friday, Stoke City won promotion to the Premier League with a tense draw against Leicester City. Their ten season spell in the top flight is now over, after a 2-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace confirmed their relegation.At full-time they remained three points from safety with one game to play, but because Swansea face Southampton on Tuesday, one of those teams’ tally will increase beyond what is available to Paul Lambert’s side.Xherdan Shaqiri had given Stoke both the lead and a bit of hope, but second-half strikes from James McArthur and Patrick van Aanholt, combined with an anaemic display in which the Potters looked absolutely terrified of their fate, sent them down.The sun burned bright and so, surreally enough, did the floodlights at the Bet365 Stadium. The home fans did their best to intimidate, booing every slight delay of a Palace throw-in as if the taker had spat on the statue of Stanley Matthews that stands outside the ground.Before the game Lambert admitted his team “lacked a cutting edge in the final third”, something of an understatement that he emphasised with his choice of strikers: Mame Diouf and Peter Crouch have two goals between them since January.Diouf had Stoke’s best chance of the early stages, heading over from the edge of the six-yard box, but this was, bitty game that neither team looked capable of getting hold of. Palace initially looked promising - Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Yohan Cabaye both curled shots just wide from the edge of the area - but they were careless in possession and created few clear chances.Lambert spent most of his time doing shuttle runs along the edge of the technical area, jawing in the ear of the fourth official, his face turning a curious shade of puce. Or, if you prefer, looking every inch the nervous manager.But his nerves were calmed just before half-time: Loftus-Cheek carelessly upended Shaqiri around 25 yards out, right of centre, the Swiss hitched his shorts up his vast thighs and whipped the ball into the top corner. It might have flicked off Loftus-Cheek in the wall in the way in, but nobody cared: Shaqiri skipped into Lambert’s arms, and there was hope in the Potteries.Yet the problem with a struggling team taking the lead is that it can often exacerbate the nerves, rather than necessarily calm them. After the break, Palace’s play didn’t really improve that much: they still made silly mistakes, still gave the ball away too much, still wasted opportunities.But they were allowed to attack as much as they liked because Stoke’s defensive line dropped virtually onto Jack Butland’s toes. Aside from the odd counter-attack, they looked like a team trying to hold on for 45 minutes, whether that was the plan or not. Lambert has tightened their defence since arriving in January, but it seemed a risky approach.And so it turned out, although ironically Palace’s equaliser came after one of Stoke’s few attacks. Wilfried Zaha led a counter, fed Loftus-Cheek who waited, waited, waited then slipped in McArthur. He bobbled a left-footed shot into the corner of the net, and shoulders slumped around the stadium.Stoke needed a goal, and it showed. Tension filled muscles, mistakes became even more frequent, defending more skittish. An argument briefly broke out between Ryan Shawcross and Badou Ndiaye after the former told the latter off for not going to the referee while being booked.The inevitable came with four minutes left. Zaha played what was actually a terrible pass looking for Van Aanholt, which Shawcross looked to intercept put poked it straight into the Dutch full-back’s path, and he slotted the ball beneath Jack Butland.Cruel, perhaps, that the final error came from the man who has been with Stoke since they came up to the top flight. But in some ways it might be the kindest thing: even with a victory Stoke might still have gone down this weekend, so at least this curtailed their pain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d982a4f95be6c413dce352d8c3e36435c82609e/42_91_3410_2047/master/3410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c14af1938c767e1847767dbf9aaff8e","title":"womens fa cup final arsenal chelsea jordan nobbs","story":"Jordan Nobbs’s Arsenal have recovered after losing their way and would ‘like to show everyone it’s not all about Chelsea and Manchester City’ in front of a record 45,000 at WembleyBy the time the final whistle approaches, the evening sun will have dipped, casting long shadows across Wembley’s wide expanses. As the television cameras zoom in to capture the starkly contrasting emotions of winners and losers, the answers to a series of questions should become clear.Will Arsenal’s renaissance under their Australian coach, Joe Montemurro, result in a 15th FA Cup win? Or might his Chelsea counterpart, Emma Hayes, clinch the first part of the domestic league and cup double she aims to secure before giving birth to twins next month?Can Katie Chapman, Chelsea’s captain, lift the trophy for a record 10th time in a 21-year career during which time she has produced three children? If so, Chapman will need to hold her own in a duel with Arsenal’s England midfielder Jordan Nobbs.Chelsea’s Fran Kirby wants to remind everyone why she has scored 22 goals in 31 games this season while also collecting virtually every inidual award going. Wembley seems the perfect stage for her to showcase the talent that has led the forward, who as a teenager overcame severe depression, to be dubbed England’s mini-Messi.“We can rely on Fran, she’s world-class,” says Chelsea’s England goalkeeper Carly Telford, who hopes to oust the regular first choice, Sweden’s outstanding Hedvig Lindahl, on Saturday. “She’s brilliant at playing between the lines.”Montemurro, a clean-sheet specialist, aims to fulfil a hope nurtured by cheering on Arsenal men while watching two-week-old editions of Match of the Day and The Big Match during his childhood in Melbourne’s northern suburbs.An anticipated record attendance for a women’s FA Cup final will gather beneath the forecasted strong May sun to see whether the 48-year-old can outwit Hayes and collect his second trophy since taking charge last autumn after Arsenal controversially sacked Pedro Martínez Losa.“After a difficult few years when we lost our way a bit we’d like to show everyone that it’s not all about Chelsea and Manchester City,” Nobbs says. “We want to show Arsenal are back and ready to really challenge again.”Once imperious in their domination of the women’s game, they have fallen behind Chelsea and City, who are once again vying for the title but Montemurro has tightened Arsenal’s defence appreciably and his side have beaten City to win the Continental Cup.“Before Joe arrived, our team wasn’t all on the same page,” Nobbs says. “Players were performing as iniduals but he’s taken us back to basics, made things very simple and created a strong framework in which we can develop our passing game and play the Arsenal way.“He’s a lovely, really positive, guy and he’s allowed me to focus on the more attacking, creative role where I feel I’m at my best.”Whereas Montemurro describes the prospect of leading out Arsenal at Wembley as surreal and fantastic, Hayes will sit things out on the sidelines, leaving her assistant, Paul Green, to do the honours.Eight months pregnant, the 41-year-old knows her limits. “Physically, it’s uncomfortable and I’ve been advised to take it easy so I’ll stay in the background,” she says. “It’s better for my babies if I sit down. I don’t mind. I’m a woman. I don’t have a big ego.”Telford is impressed how Hayes manages the assorted egos in a highly competitive Chelsea squad. “As others have said, I’m sure Emma could do very well at a high level in the men’s game,” she says. “But I think Emma’s happy in women’s football. She realises its fantastic potential in England.”Hayes also knows responsibility can be safely delegated to Chapman. Now 35, Chapman first won the FA Cup as a 14-year-old at Millwall. “I’m excited,” says the former England midfielder, whose side will want to banish the disappointment of last Sunday’s Champions League semi-final defeat by Wolfsburg by winning their second FA Cup. “Lifting the trophy again would be wonderful.”With more than 45,000 tickets sold and the match televised live on BBC One for the first time, Chapman would do so in a spotlight brighter than ever before.If the crowd should exceed the record 35,271 who watched Manchester City overcome Bimingham in last year’s final – a far cry from the disappointing 4,998 gathered at Doncaster’s Keepmoat Stadium when Arsenal beat Bristol Academy in 2013 – soaring interest in women’s football has brought increased scrutiny, not all of it entirely welcome.Behind closed doors, the wounds inflicted by Mark Sampson’s sacking as England manager last autumn after Eni Aluko’s well-documented complaints still fester. Aluko, an infrequent Chelsea starter this season, is likely to be a substitute. With her contract ending this summer, the future remains uncertain for a striker no longer on speaking terms with several former England team-mates and so far overlooked by Phil Neville, Sampson’s successor.At 31, this could be Aluko’s Wembley swansong. Might a figure who polarises opinion like no other in the female game step off the bench to goalscoring effect?Nobbs trusts it will be Arsenal’s day, with England’s Beth Mead, Montemurro’s leading scorer, or the Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema possibly registering the winner. “We’ve got a lot of experience,” she says, pointing out that Sari van Veenendaal, Danielle van de Donk and Dominque Janssen featured, like Miedema, in the Netherlands Euro 2017 triumph.“Joe’s made sure our mentality’s strong,” Nobbs says. “Winning the FA Cup would be the perfect way to prove we’re all back on the same page.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11197bba067c1d26367031af4382889bcbce773/26_128_4887_2933/master/4887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77292290db39699627e904e12e5bf77f","title":"how sheikh mansour decade long spree turned manchester city into aristocrats","story":"When Liverpool went to the Etihad Stadium for their smash-and-grab victory over Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final second leg it was odd to hear their fans sing the straight version of We Shall Not Be Moved – “just like a team that’s going to win the European Cup”.City fans’ version of that anthem was lyrically adjusted 19 years ago, when supporters who grew up on a team of internationals in the early 1970s found themselves trailing around League One while Manchester United were on their way to the treble. Watching in disbelief defeats that 1998-99 season by Lincoln City, York City and Wycombe Wanderers, standing in Blackpool’s Bloomfield Road, which had two sides condemned, some City wags reworked the words to: “We’re not really here.”It is still sung every game, the same statement of disbelief, but now at the spectacle of a world-class team in sky blue, the most expensively assembled squad in football, and the sport’s most coveted coach actually managing Manchester City. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a senior son in Abu Dhabi’s ruling dynasty, bought the club 10 seasons ago, nine years after City squeaked up from League One on penalties following Paul Dickov’s 94th-minute equaliser in the Wembley play-off final against Gillingham.On Sunday, in the stadium built with public money for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, then handed to City the year after and now sponsored by the Abu Dhabi state airline, Pep Guardiola’s team will be handed their third Premier League trophy since Mansour landed. In 116 years before that – the club was formed in 1880 as a form of social work by Anna Connell, the vicar’s daughter at St Mark’s Church – City won the league title twice. They won the League Cup twice after it began in 1960, first in 1970 during the 1968-70 era that was previously the club’s best ever, then in 1976, Dennis Tueart’s dashing overhead kick winner having to sustain a generation for 35 years of loyalty and, mostly, cock-ups.The new incarnation of Manchester City have won the League Cup three times in the past five seasons, a triumph now barely registered. This season’s third was picked\u0026nbspup on the way to winning the Premier League but Guardiola’s specified target of succeeding in Europe was challenged by losing to\u0026nbspLiverpool.So this decade of Abu Dhabi mega-investment has not been a reclamation of past supremacy – as Liverpool’s resurgence now feels – but rather a whole new ball game.When the takeover was announced in August 2008, there was understandable wariness about whether it was real and there were guffaws at first about the idea that Manchester City were going to buy the world’s best players and be rebuilt along the lines of Barcelona. The seriousness of that intention has been inexorably accepted over the decade, with £1.2bn invested from Abu Dhabi, the players recruited, trophies attained, stadium expanded to 55,000 capacity, the power-projecting academy and “Etihad campus” built next to it – and Barcelona’s former chief executive, director of football and coach working for City on Ashton New Road.When Mark Hughes was sacked as manager in December 2009, news of Roberto Mancini’s pending appointment having leaked before Hughes’s final game in the sleet against Sunderland, there was widespread ridicule of City’s official explanation that Hughes had failed to reach his “targets”. There were fewer sneers by 2013 when City said the same about targets as they sacked Mancini, who the previous season had delivered their first Premier League title with Sergio Agüero’s 94th-minute winner against Hughes’s QPR.The club’s hierarchy plays down the apparent conclusion that this is an Abu Dhabi state project, expanded now to City-owned clubs in New York and Melbourne, and ownership too of Girona, Yokohama Marinos and the Uruguayan club Atlético Torque, as well as partnerships to polish young players from the Netherlands to Venezuela.City, the hierarchy maintains, is a private investment by Mansour – they present the holding company City Football Group as the owner, not Abu Dhabi itself. They point to the emirate not being overtly promoted in this most globally broadcast of its ventures, although its tourist authority, Visit Abu Dhabi, is a sponsor on the City billboards and the Etihad name is hardly hidden under a bushel.Students of football history have always learned that a key achievement of Herbert Chapman’s visionary building of Arsenal in the 1930s was having the Gillespie Road tube station renamed after the club. Now the Etihad campus has its own link station taking supporters to the ground, so in modern football Manchester City have secured a transport stop named after the club’s sponsor.The very start of the takeover was different. It did look like a private purchase then, even something of a whim by Mansour, who already owned a football club in Abu Dhabi. The City deal was fronted by Sulaiman al-Fahim, a Dubai property developer, who boasted about the stars City were going to sign and the “very deep pockets” of the club’s new owner.This vulgarity did not play at all well in Abu Dhabi, whose ruling family has sought to marry the windfall of oil billions to a dignified national style. Fahim was moved aside in days and a senior figure in the country’s business and government institutions, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, assigned to chair the City investment and its reputation-shaping implications.It is a testament to how carefully Mubarak and his executives have approached it that, while there have been persistent objections, particularly in Europe, to their claiming football success by vast spending of a country’s resources, they have also won friends at home.They understood that, for all its new money, English football is still rooted in supporters’ loyalty and expected to be a community activity and that the stadium and Commonwealth Games were intended as catalysts for economic revival in post-industrial east Manchester. The Abu Dhabi investors donated 5.5 acres of the 80 cleaned up for the campus, valued at £18m, and contributed a further £3m towards an excellent new public leisure centre and swimming pool next to it. A new sixth-form college named after Anna Connell also sits on the land, next to the new Manchester Institute of Health and Performance, which is used by the club and community and in the rehabilitation of some victims of the Arena terror atrocity last year.There has not been notably vocal support in Manchester for the protests raised by campaign groups over human rights in Abu Dhabi, which have focused on the conditions of migrant workers and the 2011 crackdown on dissenters following calls for more democracy.In 2016 Manchester city council’s leader, Sir Richard Leese, declined a request by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to condemn the abuses, replying in a letter that “the alleged issues are beyond the remit of the city council”. Then and now the council’s assessment of their Abu Dhabi investors, who are also involved in residential projects, is: “They have made commitments not only to develop a successful business but also to invest in the regeneration of the city. They have honoured every commitment and we have found them to be exemplary partners.”At the end of 10 seasons that began with the then barmy-seeming aspiration to be “Barcelona plus” Guardiola, given £200m to spend on players last summer and £57m for Aymeric Laporte in January, is expected to be further furnished this summer with a central midfield player, centre-back and forward. The aim over the next 10 years is to become “Barcelona plus plus” and nobody doubts anymore the seriousness of that, however improbable it still feels at Manchester City, for all of this to be really here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f142e57ee64ce74cf7a0a3e1990d015b63264032/0_19_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed5f1a0c4d1b1bcdb5811877cb132836","title":"stoke city v crystal palace premier league live","story":"Roy Hodgson, who has experienced some tough times of his own over the years, makes sure not to rub it in when he shakes hands with Paul Lambert. A grim, apologetic face as he offers commiserations to his opposite number. It’s a small thing, but a classy touch, especially as Palace have completed their own escape today. Jack Butland is in floods of tears as he claps the Stoke support, who never stopped believing ... well, for 86 minutes, anyway. The bittersweet love is returned by a large crowd who have stayed behind to thank their team, despite it all. Xherdan Shaqiri, who had given Stoke hope with his first-half free kick, simply looks stunned.That’s it, all over for Stoke City. They’re relegated after a ten-year stay in the Premier League. Crystal Palace’s win ensures the survival of the south Londonders.90 min +4: Shaqiri makes a little space down the left for a cross. Shawcross, desperate to make amends, sends a header softly over the bar.90 min +3: Benteke twists and turns in the Stoke box, but can’t shoot or win a penalty.90 min +2: Palace play the corner backwards, then hold onto the ball awhile. Their fans give it the olé!s, which is really adding insult to injury.90 min +1: Benteke barrels down the left and earns a corner off Bauer.90 min: Five extra minutes. Five minutes to save Stoke City’s Premier League life.89 min: Shaqiri is booked for an appalling rake down the back of Loftus-Cheek’s leg. He should be sent packing. Loftus-Cheek is in a lot of pain.88 min: That goal will also confirm Palace’s continued membership of the Premier League. Townsend is repalced by Schlupp. The Stoke fans are beginning to make their way home, the jig nearly up.Benteke plays the ball wide right for Zaha, who looks to deliver it back into the centre for Van Aanholt. Shawcross tries to intercept ... and manages only to take the pace off the ball and tee it up for Van Aanholt. The Palace defender takes a stride and slams the ball under Butland and into the net. Is it the goal that relegates Stoke City after their ten-year stay in the Premier League?85 min: Pieters is booked for an earlier tug on Zaha. Then Sobhi twists, turns and earns Stoke’s first corner down the left. But the set piece is wasted. And then ...84 min: Townsend and Zaha exchange crisp passes down the right, before releasing Loftus-Cheek, who tries the spectacular from a tight angle. Nope! Zaha was free in the middle, too, waiting for a tap-in.83 min: Townsend dribbles with purpose down the left and earns Palace’s sixth corner of the afternoon off Allen. Nothing much comes of the set piece. Ndiaye then clatters into Loftus-Cheek. You usually see yellows for that leg-hanging clumsiness: he’s very lucky to still be on the park.81 min: Ndiaye is booked for a late tackle on Townsend.80 min: Benteke, dropping deep down the left, tries to return the favour. He’s close to finding Zaha with a fine diagonal pass. But there’s a little too much power in the pass, and it flies through to Butland.79 min: Zaha finds Benteke inside the box from the right. Benteke can’t control, but the ball nearly squirms into the bottom right anyway. Stoke are living very dangerously now.77 min: Campbell comes on for Johnson. An attacking substitution for Stoke, but within seconds they’re nearly losing, as Townsend breaks down the left and pulls the ball back for Zaha, who must surely bury it from the penalty spot. But he leans back and balloons a wild one deep into the stand. Stoke could see ten years of Premier League life flash before their eyes then.76 min: Sakho plays an awful ball out of defence, allowing Ndiaye to intercept and attempt to slip Shaqiri free. Shaqiri is dozily flagged offside.75 min: Townsend crosses low from the left. Benteke gets ahead of Pieters, but instead of flinging himself for the cross, opts to flop to the floor instead, looking for the penalty. The referee isn’t having it.74 min: A free kick for Stoke out on the left. The home heroes load the box. Shaqiri hoicks long. Allen, of all people, rises highest to win a header at the far post. But he can only send it harmlessly over the bar.72 min: Stoke’s nerves are beginning to betray them. From the Palace corner, the ball is worked to Zaha, 25 yards out down the right. Pieters comes through him. Free kick. Milivojevic curls deep. Tomkins should plant his head on the ball, on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, but Diouf does just enough to put him off.70 min: Stoke won’t be relegated if this match ends in a draw ... but they’ll be in all sorts of trouble, with Championship football next season more than likely. Accordingly, they press forwards. Shaqiri tries to find Zouma in the Palace box with a ball from the right. Nothing doing. Palace break, and they’re two on two! Fortunately for Stoke, Townsend overplays a bit, and nobody gets a shot away. But they do earn a corner on the right.Stoke ship yet another lead! Zaha romps through the middle of the park. He slips the ball to his left for Loftus-Cheek, who shuttles it on further. McArthur, on the overlap, slides the ball across Butland and into the bottom right! It had been coming.67 min: Sobhi comes on for Crouch.65 min: Milivojevic tries to get his head onto the free kick, but nothing significant occurs. Pieters clatters Zaha. Nerves are jangling now. This is all very edgy.63 min: Bauer is booked for a fairly basic challenge on Zaha. Before the free kick can be taken, Benteke comes on for Cabaye, and there’s some playground shoving on the edge of the Stoke area. Johnson, 33, and Tomkins, 29, are booked.61 min: Palace push Stoke back. But suddenly Stoke break out. Allen rolls a fine pass down the right to release Shaqiri into acres of space. The ball’s rolled inside for Diouf, who should power clear but can’t sort his feet out. Then Crouch tries to take up possession on the edge of the area, but he goes over instead of getting a shot away. What a chance to put some daylight between themselves and Palace!60 min: Milivojevic chips the free kick over the Stoke back line, but Tomkins, coming in from the left, can’t stop the ball from going out for a goal kick.57 min: Zaha turns crisply down the left and slips a pass down the wing for Townsend. Townsend flashes the ball across the face of goal, where Zaha and Loftus-Cheek look to poke home, but the winger had gone early and is rightly flagged for offside. A totally unnecessary mistake, and Palace are currently burning chances to get back into this match.56 min: ... a short-corner routine goes badly wrong. Van Aanholt tries to rescue the situation with a shot from distance, but his effort flies miles over the bar.55 min: Milivojevic has a dig from 25 yards. The ball’s deflected wide left for a corner. From which ...54 min: Shaqiri makes to chip the ball past Milivojevic, who raises an arm to block it. The Palace midfielder is booked for deliberate handball.53 min: Allen tries to release Shaqiri down the right, but there’s too much juice on the ball.51 min: We go again. Sakho and Crouch tussle under a high ball. Crouch is penalised for being overly aggressive. He’s got Sakho’s face in his hand at one point, as he shoves him backwards to the ground. He’s very lucky not to see yellow. Some referees, on a hair-trigger, might even have flashed red. An unnecessary risk, given the predicament his team is in.50 min: So much for that lively start: Zouma spends a couple of minutes getting treatment.48 min: Palace string together some pretty triangles in the middle of the park. Suddenly Cabaye slips one down the left channel for Loftus-Cheek, whose shot from the edge of the area is stopped by a sliding Pieters. The ball ricochets off Loftus-Cheek and out for a goal kick it hasn’t been his day so far. But Palace nearly sliced Stoke open there. A lively start to the half.47 min: Shawcross lifts the ball long. Crouch, on the edge of the D, heads on to Diouf, who has his back to goal but a chance to flick Shaqiri free to his right. The flick doesn’t quite come off, but that was a sweet move, proof that long-ball football can be beautiful too. It would have been a fine goal.We’re off again! Stoke get the party restarted. No half-time changes.Half-time reading: It’s the Women’s FA Cup Final later today. We’ll be covering it here, so get up to speed with Louise Taylor’s preview of the big Wembley showdown between Chelsea and cup specialists Arsenal. See you at 5.30pm for that one!Stoke haven’t been particularly coherent. But Xherdan Shaqiri, with a little help from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, has given them a precious half-time lead. As things stand, their survival bid remains a live prospect! 45 min +2: Zaha dribbles down the left, momentarily bothering Stoke. Then Kelly tries to find someone in the middle from a position out right. Ndiaye sticks out a leg to block and takes a sore whack. He’s down getting treatment.45 min +1: That goal has given Stoke a huge lift, as you’d expect. Pieters launches into the Palace box. Shawcross is causing the visitors concern. Hennessey just about deals with the situation.45 min: Loftus-Cheek played a big part in Palace’s downfall there. He tries to make amends immediately, chesting down a Townsend cross from the right. But he can’t sort his feet out, ten yards from goal, and Stoke clear. There will be four added minutes of this intriguing half.44 min: Stoke haven’t been very good. But that was a delicious free kick. And the stadium explodes into life! Shaqiri and Lambert cavort on the touchline accordingly.Shaqiri curls the free kick into the top right! The ball took a little deflection off the eyebrows of Loftus-Cheek, sending it right into the corner. Hennessey would have had little chance of saving Shaqiri’s effort anyway, but that deflection definitely took it out of his reach!42 min: Loftus-Cheek tries to break upfield from deep. Allen robs him and feeds Shaqiri, who is upended by Loftus-Cheek. A free kick, just to the right of the Palace D. One for Shaqiri, who springs up in excitable fashion with a view to taking the set piece.40 min: Ward, injured earlier, can’t continue. Kelly comes on as he limps off.38 min: Ward dallies over a throw. Oh, it’s not Palace’s! He takes his own sweet time to give the ball back to Bauer, who has steam coming out of his ears. Palace are pressing Stoke’s buttons this afternoon. The crowd respond accordingly. Magnificent pantomime.36 min: After Zaha is bollocked by the referee for moaning about the minor incident with Johnson, Palace work their corner in from the left. Cabaye tries to fire a spectacular one into the top right from the left of the D. The effort just about stays inside the stadium."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e34cdd569eba5f0e826e3ced230e63c9acc775b/0_148_3920_2352/master/3920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f6a9733d1f36daf4034c7266182fbc","title":"west brom v tottenham bournemouth v swansea and more clockwatch live","story":"“No Hart or Chicharito on the bench for West Ham,” notes Ian Sargeant. “Story?”Hernandez has a knee injury.

Her mother, then 16, joined them in 1963, finding work, a Jamaican-born husband and a reassuringly familiar West Indian community.As she grew up in 70s and 80s north London, the language, music and food of Natasha’s family life were steeped in the Caribbean island culture. “The first sound on a Saturday morning was pan lids. By 11.30am, the weekend’s food – mutton soup with dumplings, curry goat – was ready,” she says. Home had two meanings, she realised early on. “For my mum, ‘home’ – Jamaica – involved a different sense of identity and connection to the earth than ‘home’ – London.”So when Natasha’s grandmother, Louisa, died four years ago, it was to the rituals of Jamaica that her family turned. “Someone just said, ‘Oh, we must do a nine night, and there was no more discussion. We had to honour her and do it the right way,” Natasha, 42, recalls.The traditional Jamaican wake, the nine night, sees family and friends gather over nine consecutive evenings to swap stories, eat and drink. Overseeing proceedings is the departing spirit until, on the final night, it is ready to leave home for ancestral roots in Africa and eternal peace. “I had heard people say they were going to a nine. I’d probably been to them when I was little, but wasn’t really aware of it,” Natasha says. Like many children of immigrants, she realised, she knew neither what was expected nor what to expect.“We were supposed to understand it all, but how? For my grandparents and my mum, far from home, these traditions just made sense: they were comforting. But my generation lost touch with the rituals. Nobody had time to explain. They were busy just surviving, and we wanted to be the same as everyone else anyway. It can take a long time to appreciate your heritage.”Now Natasha, an actor and writer, has turned the “exhausting, intense” experience of her grandmother’s send-off – and the cultural and generational conflicts it highlighted – into Nine Night, her first play, a poignant comedy currently on at the National Theatre, London.Plot twists have been added (“It’s not my family on the stage”) but the inspiration for the characters, language and setting is clear. “I gave the designers a photo of my grandparents’ front room: religious icons, crocheted placemats, ornaments everywhere. For visitors to look at, not for us to play with. And there it all is, recreated on set.”Looking on, she can almost hear her childhood. “The sound system was next to the television. Grandad always had his music playing. Grandma always had her soaps on. It would be Coronation Street with dub bass underneath.”When her grandmother died, her grandfather put away his sound system. “The house became deathly quiet,” she says. “Music would have been totally inappropriate to him. He had lost his wife of 50 years. He was in shock. I remember him standing in the kitchen looking lost, as though he was trying to locate Grandma somewhere.”Practicalities fell to Natasha and her siblings, and, in common with several characters in her play, they set about organising their grandmother’s nine night more out of duty than conviction. “We just got on with it. ‘Who’s cooking the rice and peas? Who’s getting the drinks?’ And somehow all these people came.”Invitation was by word of mouth. “I don’t remember making any calls. People kept turning up. I would pick up the phone: ‘Ya hear Louisa dead? Ah is it? Me a go come.’”People began arriving around 3pm, bearing drinks, maybe a dish – “saltfish fritters, plantain. By the last night, it was like a wedding feast” – Natasha says. “They might stay all evening. It was not at all like a neighbour popping in for a quick cup of tea. You had to feed them. If people had made their way from south London to north London, they were there for the innings.”The catering, the sense of show and the endless conversation were physically and emotionally draining. “There were people from Grandma’s church, the allotment, Grandad’s pub visits, various jobs, all those 50s and 60s immigrants with so much shared experience. Women who last saw me years ago were annoyed that I didn’t have a clue who they were, protesting, ‘But I’m Joyce!’”The stories, some half-remembered from childhood, many new, were the highlight of the evenings. “I heard about them swimming in Jamaica, the jobs they did there, how they met, going to parties here, walking home because no cab driver would take them. It was stuff I had never asked about, the things we would have been told were ‘big people’s business’,” Natasha says. “I understood them as more than my strict grandparents. I could see them in Jamaica, or as young people, kicking about London as I would.”The differences between traditional British and Jamaican rituals around death, Natasha soon realised, were striking. “I had been to cremations and thought, ‘Oh, it’s over already. I haven’t worked up to tears yet.’ This is supposed to overwhelm. The emotion of grief is heightened so you can let it out. It’s like all your senses are being stimulated.”As the nights progressed, Natasha came to see that the process held different significance for each of Louisa’s relatives. “I was there for Grandad and my mum, but the nine night is as much about the spirit of the person passing well as it is about picking up the bereaved. Sometimes those needs seem to be conflicting.”When Natasha and her siblings were asked by their mother to rearrange the bedroom – a scene that, adapted, features in the play – they were horrified. In fact, they came to learn, nine night tradition dictates that furniture be moved, the spirit’s subsequent disorientation encouraging them to depart. “We were just looking at Mum. ‘Are you serious? Grandad has lost his wife and you want us to start shifting his bed around!’”They refused, a decision Natasha subsequently regretted. “It was so important to Mum, but we couldn’t see why. I have never felt more western than in that moment.”The disagreement marked a turning point. “We hadn’t realised Mum had such clear ideas about what mattered to her. My generation disconnected from this tradition, but I realised then that I needed to be open and curious, to step out of my British bubble.”Natasha began to reassess her childhood, to talk to her mother. “I had known Mum was quite spiritual, but I had always found her stories spooky. I couldn’t go into school and tell my white friends that my great-grandfather went into a trance and flew into a tree, so I shut her down a bit.”She had learned to hide minor ailments. “If you coughed, Mum was straight out in the garden with her scissors – I have no idea what she was growing – and boiling you up some revolting brew.” Now, she accepts, the cures always seemed to work.The recent revelation of deportation threats experienced by many of her grandparents’ Windrush generation has fuelled Natasha’s determination to learn more about the difficulties they faced. Arriving in Britain, she says, her grandfather was shocked to learn that many landlords had raised rents to price out immigrants. “He has dementia now but if he could make sense of this situation, he wouldn’t be surprised,” she says.With two children of her own, aged 11 and eight, Natasha’s desire to connect them with their heritage is strong. They attended the nine night and now love to hear their grandma Ruby’s stories. “They find Mum hilarious. She is funny, but Jamaican humour is direct. It can be cutting,” she laughs. Her mother’s voice features heavily in the play, Natasha says, but she has no reason to fear a telling off.Each year, she books flights for her mother’s trip to Jamaica. “There’s that pull to where she belongs,” Natasha says. “This time she asked me to arrange her return in August. I pointed out my play would have finished its run by then. ‘Ah yes,’ she said. ‘Well, just get me a programme.’”• Nine Night is at the National Theatre until 26 May.Commenting on this piece?

Life was good: he had a successful career, a solid relationship, good health and sound finances. Then he learnt about the happiness curve and it all became clear.Academics have found increasing evidence that happiness through adulthood is U-shaped – life satisfaction falls in our 20s and 30s, then hits a trough in our late 40s before increasing until our 80s. Forget the saying that life begins at 40 – it’s 50 we should be looking toward.Rauch, a senior fellow at the US thinktank the Brookings Institution, was so relieved to have found an explanation for the gloom that hit him and, he believed, many others in middle age that he became evangelical about spreading the word. He has written a book, The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50 (out in the US 1 May and UK 14 June), which includes personal stories, the latest data and illuminating interviews with economists, psychologists and neuroscientists.“The most surprising thing is that age tends to work in favour of happiness, other things being equal,” he tells the . “The most strange thing is that midlife slump is often about nothing.”Hold off on splashing out on that flashy sports car or embarking on an affair though. It is not the same as a midlife crisis, which according to the stereotype demands an urgent, rash response. The slump isn’t caused by anything, according to Rauch. It is a natural transition, simply due to the passing of time. “It’s a self-eating spiral of discontent,” he says. “It’s not because there’s something wrong with your life, or your marriage, or your mind, or your mental health.”Not everyone will experience a sunnier outlook in their 50s and beyond, Rauch acknowledges, because factors such as orce, unemployment or illness can counter this. But, other things being equal, the U-curve holds.Rauch, an author and journalist, adds: “Those most likely to notice the arrow of time are the people without a lot of other change or difficulty in their life. Things seem to be going well for them, they’re achieving their goals, and nothing much has changed. They think, ‘Why do I feel less satisfied than I expected to? Why is this going on year after year? Why does it seem to be getting worse and not better? There must be something wrong with my life.’“Well, there’s nothing wrong with your life, you’re just feeling the effects of time which others who may have more turbulent lives may not notice as much.” Rauch details a raft of research in his book to back up his claims. A 2008 study by economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald found the U-curve – with the nadir, on average, at age 46 – in 55 of 80 countries, and they cited more than 20 other papers finding the U. It tends to show up in wealthier countries where people live longer, healthier lives. Life satisfaction statistics for the UK in 2014-15 show happiness declining from youth through middle age, hitting a low at 50 and rising to a peak at 70.Not all economists and psychologists agree. Economists Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton factored in the possibility that those who become happier in the studies are the same people who are more content when they start out. This can help them achieve greater career or relationship success, which leads to more happiness. Correcting for this effect, the U-shape disappears.Rauch, however, believes he is a textbook example of the U-curve. His mother suffered from depression and his parents broke up when he was 12, leaving his father to bring up three children on his own. Two years later, his father, a stressed and overworked lawyer in his mid-40s, lost his biggest client.Rauch remembers himself at 20, keen to accomplish something worthwhile by middle age and believing that when he did, he’d appreciate it.By his 40s, he had surpassed his dreams. He had published books he was winning journalism prizes he was in a relationship with Michael, the man he would later marry he lived in an area of north Virginia with a strong sense of community. Yet he was preoccupied with what he had not achieved.He explains: “I was someone who was fortunate. I had good health and after my 20s, which were difficult because I came out as gay, I met one goal after another with more success than I’d ever expected. “All these feelings of discontent and restlessness – and even sometimes worthlessness and this feeling I’d almost wasted my life – kept coming back.“None of this made any rational sense. I began to think there must be something wrong with me. I began to think my personality had begun to turn dark in some way and that of course compounded the problem.”Around 50, the fog began to lift, despite the death of both his parents, the loss of his magazine job and the failure of a startup venture. Rauch, 58, says: “In my 50s, first the volume of the demons’ voices went down, and now I rarely hear their voices at all.” While researching his book, Rauch spoke to many people who’d experienced similar feelings.Karla, 54, is on the upswing of the curve. She says she is savouring her friendships more, feeling more organised and efficient, and doing more volunteering work. “Now I feel grateful for the now,” she tells Rauch. “On a day-to-day basis I probably do the same things, but I feel different.”Rauch tells the : “That’s a very profound insight because what we’re talking about here is not that the conditions of your life change in some huge way, but how you feel about your life changes.”Rauch puts forward various explanations for why we feel happier in our 50s and beyond.Research shows that older people feel less stress and regret, dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. Nor is status competition as important.Rauch says: “We seem to be wired to seek maximum status when we are young – the ambition to be on top of the world, to have the big job, to have the extraordinary marriage to the wonderful person or lots of money. Or some form of greatness, which is what I dreamed of in my 20s, to write some book that would outdo Shakespeare.”We are over-optimistic in youth about how much satisfaction we will get out of our future successes, he believes.“As we get into our 30s and 40s, we’ve achieved most of those things, but we’re not wired to sit back and enjoy our status. “The same ambition that made us status hungry makes us hungry for more status. We’re on the hedonic treadmill. We don’t feel the satisfaction we expected, so we think there’s something wrong with our lives.”As we get older, our values change. “You hear people say, ‘I don’t feel the need to check those boxes any more’, or ‘I don’t care that much what other people think’.”Older people feel relieved of a burden that makes it easier to savour other simpler pursuits such as spending time with grandchildren, a hobby or volunteer work. Rauch would like to see more help for people to relaunch themselves after this midlife transition, including greater opportunities for adult learning and companies creating more part-time positions or allowing gap years.“There’s a huge amount of untapped wisdom and potential to be unlocked. Because of the happiness curve, they’re often in a position where they want to give back. They want to be mentors, they want to be volunteers and they want to work at not so difficult jobs which allow them to use their skills.”Rauch has a few tips for relieving midlife malaise, such as talking to friends about it and understanding it’s normal. It is also helpful to stop comparing yourself to others, he says.But if all that makes no difference, give it time. As Rauch approaches 60, he feels ever more grateful for his life. He wishes he’d known this when he was in the trough of the curve because, as he says: “It’s worth the wait.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6211d329c8a86425bba59d26f44c4a644ad194f3/1063_677_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80cb51ab8c7409bddd772e4f166542e","title":"meera sodha recipe green pea black eyed bean chickpea usal","story":"Bring some ersity to your Indian food repertoire with this spiced soup packed with pulsesIndia is a country of 1.3bn people who live across 29 states from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.

She had spent the previous decade teaching in Cambridge but last July she and her husband moved north. And while Sheffield has provided a great job and an affordable home, one thing the notoriously friendly city has not provided is mates.“No one talks about the process of making friends at our age,” she says. Olivia has tried. She bonded with someone in her Zumba class, but weeks later the woman got a job in another city. Her job has not helped. “There aren’t a lot of people in my stage of life at work, and anyway, as a teacher you spend the whole day in a classroom full of teenagers.”And so Olivia is taking a proactive step – she is going speed mating.Billed as “Tinder for friends, but in real life” the initiative is the brainchild of Megan Griffith, co-founder of the arts collective Girl Gang. The Sheffield event is held at the Leadmill nightclub. About 40 people turn up, almost all of them women (men are welcome, says Griffith, but need to know they will be in the minority). They range in age from early 20s to mid 40s. On arrival everyone is given a sheet with spaces for names, email addresses and phone numbers. Olivia’s original goal for the evening was to get one person’s number. “But then I thought, maybe that’s unrealistic so I’ve lowered my expectations. I’ve just got to see it as having a fun evening, and even if it goes badly, at least it’ll make a good story in the staff room.”The “Speed-Mating” event begins with “person bingo”, then people pair up and ask quick-fire questions for five minutes. Next they pair up with someone else to ask “would you rather?” questions, and a third person for “snog, marry avoid”.Kerry Chase and Aimée White are paired up and quickly move on from talking about the suggested questions to chatting about White’s time living in Serbia. A newcomer to Sheffield, White bemoans how tricky it is to make friends as an adult.“It’s not like when you’re a kid,” she says. “You can’t just say: ‘Let’s go play’. It’s like: ‘I’m not being creepy, but I just want a friend.’ Yeah, that’s creepy.”For several hours people chat, debate current affairs in small groups, make outfits out of newspaper and participate in various “organised fun” activities, all the time sussing each other out as potential friend material.After the first event in Manchester in October 2016, Girl Gang has run a dozen speed mating nights across Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, and has had requests to start them up everywhere from York to Leamington Spa. However, they often sell more tickets than they have guests.Griffith says: “They’ve obviously booked a ticket thinking ‘I would really benefit from this event’, but then when it comes down to it, they can’t quite make themselves go.”Still, she thinks the event’s appeal comes from the fact that admitting to having no friends is taboo, so activities do not exist to help people build friendships.A 2013 analysis of 277 peer-reviewed studies on social relationships found that the size of people’s friendship networks increased until young adulthood and then decreased steadily from that point, suggesting that making friends becomes, if not more difficult, then at least less common.This could be for many reasons, such as family, jobs and time, according to Rachel Boyd of the mental health charity Mind. “Friendship groups can become more established, so it can feel even harder to meet new people if they already have their own groups of friends.”Moving home can represents a particular challenge. “Certainly it can be really difficult if you’re in unfamiliar territory to know how to meet people,” Boyd says.The Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that 9 million Britons always or often feel lonely, largely due to the weakening of traditional community spaces, such as churches, trade unions, pubs and workplaces.“In the last few decades, loneliness has escalated from personal misfortune into a social epidemic,” the Labour MP and commission chair, Rachel Reeves, said in a speech in December. “More and more of us live alone. We work at home more. We spend a greater part of our day alone than we did 10 years ago. It sometimes feels like our best friend is the smartphone.”However, technology, while often being blamed for social disconnection and isolation, may also form part of the solution. Bumble, the dating app known for not allowing men to contact women first, launched Bumble BFF in 2015, allowing people to find potential friends, after users said they wanted to use the origninal app for that purpose.But using an app or going to an event like speed mating to find friends is not without its stigma. Olivia is a pseudonym because she knows that if she used her real name and her students read this article “basically they would take the mick out of me”. When she told people she was going to a speed mating event, reactions were mixed. “I made a real effort to be vulnerable, so I told a few people I was doing this. Some people thought it was a bit weird, some people thought it was a great idea, others thought it was sad that I didn’t have friends, but then they offered to be friends with me,” she says, laughing.After the event, Olivia says she is exhausted: “I didn’t expect it to be so full-on.”“I felt like there were two groups – people who had gone with someone and were maybe approaching it as a fun chance to meet people, and people who I thought were in a similar position to me.“It’s also just reassuring to know I’m not the only person to feel like this. It’s not sad and it’s not pathetic, being 29 and not having friends in a new city.”Olivia has exceeded her goal for the evening, collecting three people’s numbers.The next day, she says she has been exchanging banter-filled texts and organised to go for a drink with one woman she met. A week later, she has had an offer to go to a comedy gig with a group, and a drink with someone else.“I’d say it’s absolutely been a success,” she says. “The other thing I’ve found is I’m more confident approaching people and suggesting meeting up. I think it’s given me a bit of a boost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27bd68848fb7baaba327816bb613f76c5bb09c8c/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=557e52ca08e82323a0dd6a9a6e58c779","title":"the eight weirdest collaborations in pop","story":"From Janet Jackson and Cliff Richard’s Two to the Power of Love, to Shaggy and Sting’s new record, here’s a rundown of the oddest musical melangesHave you ever wondered, perhaps in a darker moment, what an album featuring noted lutenist Sting crooning alongside sporadic novelty hitmaker Shaggy might sound like? Well, wonder no more, because last month they unleashed 44876, an “island-influenced” collaborative album that honours “the duo’s mutual love of Jamaica”. If you’re now thinking: “OK, but why?” then Sting has the answer. “The most important thing to me in any kind of music is surprise,” he told Rolling Stone. “And everybody is surprised by this collaboration – by what they’re hearing. We’re surprising.” Indeed. Another “surprising” recent collaboration was Q-Tip and Demi Lovato who have “reimagined” Elton John’s Don’t Go Breaking My Heart, while 2018 has also graced us with Charlie Puth trying to keep up with Boyz II Men, Justin Timberlake saying nothing with only-famous-in-America human beard Chris Stapleton and Sheryl Crow trying to keep her composure while the bloke from Britpop also-rans Reef shreds his larynx on My Sweet Love.With head-scratching musical pile-ups set to continue, we look at some of the best, AKA worst.It is weird to think that in 1998 it was rugged soap star-turned-rugged pop star Matthew Marsden who probably had to be convinced to work with Beyoncé. After signing a half-a-million-pound record deal with Columbia Records, having impressed them by a 12-month stint as a mechanic in Corrie, Marsden was paired with labelmates Destiny’s Child (first album lineup) for a perfunctory cover of Hall \u0026amp Oates’s She’s Gone. Beyoncé etc do the absolute minimum, barely masking the fact that their bits in the video were clearly shot in a record label office, likely on a separate continent to Marsden, with a record label employee holding the door shut.Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson’s earnest Whatzupwitu (opening line of the video: “The elephant is dying”) tries to communicate man’s ills via the medium of cheap-sounding R\u0026ampB. One explanation for its existence is that Jackson only agreed to do it as part of a deal to get Murphy in his Remember the Time video a year earlier. Why else would noted perfectionist Jackson agree to be in a video that was apparently created using the very first iteration of MS Paint? “Always in the trees,” Jackson sings with underserved gusto while an illustrated heart is superimposed on to his forehead “Always in the seas,” he warbles while a shower of musical notes rains down. At the end, as a crudely drawn dove of peace flutters by, Murphy clamps his hand over Jackson’s mouth, probably to stop him shouting for help.Coldplay have always worried about staying relevant, even when their stage outfits suggested otherwise. As early as 2004, Chris Martin co-wrote and appeared on Jamelia’s See It In a Boy’s Eyes, following that with a collaboration with the then white-hot Nelly Furtado on 2006’s All Good Things (Come to an End). In 2012, he brought serial collaborator Rihanna into the fold on Princess of China, wise to the fact she can make anyone in her radius cooler by proxy, even Jonny Buckland. In 2017, aware that streaming rules the charts and faceless DJs are Radio 1 catnip, Coldplay sidled up to US dance bros Chainsmokers for the brainless Something Just Like This, which was a Top 3 hit in the UK and US. Fingers crossed this leads to a Calvin Harris v Starsailor remix of Alcoholic.Around the same time that Beyoncé was busy re-reading her contract and ignoring Matthew Marsden’s messages, future husband Jay-Z was in a similar bind. His Roc-A-Fella Records imprint had signed a deal in the UK with Northwestside, who, as it so happened, had a new boyband by the name of Another Level they, coincidentally, had some space on a remix for a big-name US rapper. The song was Be Alone No More, and while Jay’s verse wasn’t awful, he might have been rethinking his choices when he realised his remix only peaked at 11 in the UK, five places lower than the original, Jay-Z-less version.Obviously Kanye West isn’t exactly adverse to the unexpected collaboration – Fall Out Boy, Adam Levine, Estelle – but even during his most charitable moments there’s always been a sense of perspective. That went out of the window in 2010 when he collaborated with Oscar-winning egotist Jared Leto and his side-project Thirty Seconds to Mars on Hurricane. Over Leto’s strained vocals and a backing track that would make Muse wince, Kanye whips out his vocoder for some nonsensical burbling that really should have stayed locked on someone’s hard drive.By 1986, after her first two solo albums had flopped, Janet Jackson was talking a lot about control. Control of her personal life (she’d recently annulled her marriage to James DeBarge) control of her career (she’d fired her controlling manager, father Joseph) and control of who she was as an artist (she’d hired producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis). You have to hope that in among all that annulling, firing and hiring she sought the requisite level of revenge on whoever came up with pairing her with Cliff Richard on 1984’s Giorgio Moroder-produced Two to the Power of Love. While a naive young Janet goes for playful and coy, Cliff delivers his lines like a Tory MP reciting grime lyrics.Since capitalising on the EDM boom, 50-year-old French DJ and producer David Guetta has worked with almost everyone. Seriously. This man’s iPhone address book is basically a who’s who of every bandwagon-jumping artist signed to a major label. It’s not just your typical dance music-adjacent pop stars, either. Give me the name of an unexpected collaborator and chances are he’s twiddled knobs in their vicinity. Stereo MCs? Yep, they’re on 2004’s amazingly titled Guetta Blaster album. Lil Wayne? Oh yes, on a 2011 album track that unfortunately also included Chris Brown.

You’ve had Windrush, you’ve had Grenfell, you’ve had the Brexit negotiations going from bad to worse, you’ve had the National Health Service under more pressure than it’s been for a long, long time, serial incompetence day after day after day, yet the public do not seem in nearly sufficient numbers remotely interested in supporting the Labour party.”Campbell, who backs a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, said Labour should not be seen as supporting Theresa May’s plans for leaving the EU.Referencing a Blair-era soundbite, Campbell said Labour should be “tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit”, fighting against the UK’s departure from the EU while addressing the concerns of those who voted to leave.He said that if Labour’s Brexit tests were to mean anything the party could not support May’s strategy. “If they do, then though the Tories will be seen as Brexit’s architect, Labour will be its bricklayer, and history is harsh when the house comes tumbling down,” he said.“My Labour tribalism is being pushed to the limit by the return of militant-style nastiness in local politics, by my revulsion that any antisemitism has been allowed to fester, by the feeling that some in the leadership and their supporters feel much greater animus against other Labour supporters than against Tories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696f7b1d46a45b26fc0a4473c94bc2c385a1a75/0_565_4037_2423/master/4037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21824d57c2bad6fda679a61aad8a4d7f","title":"nasa launches insight spacecraft mars","story":"A robotic geologist armed with a hammer and quake monitor rocketed toward Mars on Saturday, aiming to land on the red planet and explore its mysterious insides.In a twist, Nasa launched the Mars InSight lander from California rather than Florida’s Cape Canaveral. It was the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the west coast, drawing pre-dawn crowds to Vandenberg Air Force Base and rocket watchers down the California coast into Baja. The spacecraft will take more than six months to get to Mars and start its unprecedented geologic excavations, traveling 300 million miles to get there. InSight will dig deeper into Mars than ever before – nearly 16ft – to take the planet’s temperature. It will also attempt to make the first measurements of marsquakes, using a high-tech seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface. The Atlas V rocket also carried a pair of mini satellites, or CubeSats, meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration. The $1bn mission involves scientists from the US, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. “I can’t describe to you in words how very excited I am … to go off to Mars,” said project manager Tom Hoffman from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “It’s going to be awesome.”If all goes well, the three-legged InSight will descend by parachute and engine firings onto a flat equatorial region of Mars – believed to be free of big, potentially dangerous rocks – on 26 November. Once down, it will stay put, using a mechanical arm to place the science instruments on the surface. “This mission will probe the interior of another terrestrial planet, giving us an idea of the size of the core, the mantle, the crust and our ability then to compare that with the Earth,” said Nasa chief scientist Jim Green. “This is of fundamental importance to understand the origin of our solar system and how it became the way it is today.” InSight’s chief scientist, Bruce Banerdt of JPL, said Mars was ideal for learning how the rocky planets of our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Unlike our active Earth, Mars has not been transformed by plate tectonics and other processes, he noted. Over the course of two Earth years – or one Martian year – scientists expect InSight’s three main experiments to provide a true 3-D image of Mars. The lander is equipped with a seismometer for measuring marsquakes, a self-hammering probe for burrowing beneath the surface, and a radio system for tracking the spacecraft’s position and planet’s wobbly rotation, thereby revealing the size and composition of Mars’ core. “InSight, for seismologists, will really be a piece of history, a new page of history,” said the Paris Institute of Earth Physics’ Philippe Lognonne, lead scientist of the InSight seismometer. Problems with the French-supplied seismometer kept InSight from launching two years ago. California was always part of the plan. Nasa normally launches from Cape Canaveral, but decided to switch to California for InSight to take advantage of a shorter flight backlog. This was the first US interplanetary mission to launch from somewhere other than Cape Canaveral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ceeb062e1284f9a00dd0ba439f3d07ca91e49ed/11_34_3489_2094/master/3489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a3f23f1b4dbaeb9fee8e6dd0c3c51a","title":"home office criticised disabled man accommodation with steps","story":"High court judge laments ‘lack of clarity’ in case of man who has suffered long delays in being allocated safe accommodationA high court judge has criticised the home secretary, Sajid Javid, for failing to provide safe and suitable accommodation for a vulnerable disabled man after his release from detention.The 44-year-old man, who uses a wheelchair following a stroke and is legally defined as lacking mental capacity, could not get into accommodation provided by the Home Office on Wednesday night because it had steps and nobody answered the door.The confused man was forced to wait in the street. Later, he was driven around London for part of the night by the taxi driver who brought him to the address after his release from detention. He was placed in a hostel as a temporary measure.The disabled man was initially supposed to be released from detention six weeks ago but the Home Office continued to detain him as they were unable to identify suitable, wheelchair-accessible accommodation.The criticism from circuit judge Karen Jane Walden-Smith, sitting as a high court judge, is likely to be the first judicial rebuke received byJavid, who only became home secretary on Monday following Amber Rudd’s resignation.The Official Solicitor is involved with the case because the man lacks mental capacity. The disabled man is Jamaican and has been in the UK for 17 years. He was granted leave to remain before serving two years and three months in prison. The nature of his convictions were not disclosed in court.Following his release, the Home Office opened deportation proceedings against the man. A psychiatric assessment found that he lacked mental capacity and had PTSD and a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.He had been held in detention since last July, although the Home Office accepted that he was an “adult at risk”. Following a judicial review launched by the man’s solicitors, the Home Office authorised his release from detention on 21March.However, he was not physically released from detention until the evening of 2 May, the day before a court hearing in the case. On arrival at his allocated accommodation that night, he discovered steps leading to the front door, which was not opened by the occupants.Shortly before 10pm the man called his solicitor using the taxi driver’s phone, who advised that he should be returned to detention so that alternative accommodation could be arranged. The taxi driver said he had no authorisation to do this. The disabled man complained of back pain as a result of the journey and waiting around, and requested an ambulance be called. He also became agitated and threatened to break the taxi’s windows.The judge criticised the “lack of clarity about what was happening”. She said that alternative accommodation was found but the man said it was not wheelchair-accessible, so he was taken to a hostel in south London for newly arrived asylum seekers, where he remains. The Home Office has not yet found suitable permanent alternative accommodation that has sufficient disabled access.She ruled that the new accommodation must be wheelchair-accessible and give the man easy access to a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. She said if the Home Office failed to comply, the man could bring the matter back to court.“The secretary of state has acted very much last minute, at the last hour,” she said.The Home Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762890bf53944b4f0602fdac2b6e83372a53d679/0_45_3460_2077/master/3460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a627d3d7353bdf39a3e348373a91e747","title":"tony bellew cause havoc david haye rematch","story":"• Bellew promises to ‘smash’ Haye in fierce pre-fight tirade• Boxers return to ring 14 months after Bellew won first boutThe conversation with Tony Bellew was idling towards an emotional conclusion as he reflected on what mattered to him in life: family, home, friends, Everton Football Club. And then the fighter detailed in a chilling blast of invective what he was going to do to David Haye at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday night.It was a tirade only a fighter could properly defend, or understand – and it sounded so much like Haye in his pomp.Moments earlier, Bellew had spoken with quiet sorrow about the death of his brother-in-law, Ashley, who fell to his death from a balcony on a family holiday in Cancun last August.“What my family’s been through I can’t even put into words. We’re very close. It’s really, really hard. It’s in my thoughts, when I’m sitting here. I think about Ashley’s mum and dad. I really do.”He spoke, too, about how his 12-year-old son was being ragged at school before the first fight, taunted that his father was going to be knocked out.“Our Corey likes to think he can have a fight, the fact is he couldn’t fight sleep. He’s a lovely looking boy. Looks just like his mother, a handsome kid. I wouldn’t be fighting if I had his looks when I was a kid.”Friday’s weigh-in passed without incident, although they managed a few ritual verbals. Away from the microphone, Haye whispered to Bellew: “I’m going to take my time with you. I’m going to chop you down. It’s going to be slow and painful. I’m going to make sure you suffer.”Haye looked his body-beautiful self at 15st 10lb, a stone lighter than 14 months ago. Bellew weighed just over 15st, three pounds lighter than in March 2017.The numbers that will count will be heavy blows landed, and Haye reckons his new Cuban coach, Ismael Salas, has fixed a long-standing fault in his footwork that will enable him to get more leverage on his already awesome punches. “I fought like a lunatic in the first fight. All the shots I was missing are going to be landing. Ismael has rewired my legs,” Haye said. “In the first fight – and even in the two previous fights – my legs weren’t connected. He’s noticed that. This is the best I’ve felt in 10 years. A lot of operations, a lot of punches in that time. But it feels right – and it will feel very wrong for Tony.”While Bellew has raged this time, Haye has gone for an almost super-soft approach. He has praised his conqueror repeatedly, only to be rebuffed. Bellew, a master of intransigence, picks at his ego, agreeing with nothing, arguing over nothing too.“In all honesty he’s a proper gobshite,” Bellew says. “I think he’s a tit. He’s got a mask on. He’s doing really well hiding his feelings and emotions. Why is he having to answer to me, a little fat Scouser? It shows how far back he’s gone. It infuriates him that I’ve got any kind of demands at all over him.“He knows he can’t say all the things he said last time because the media won’t absorb it. I’m not here for the media. I’m not here for the public. I’m here because this is my job. I just tell the truth. Some people don’t like it. Some people do. I’m just telling you exactly how I feel.”Bellew is scornful too that Haye is still fighting six years after he said he would be out of the business at 31.“Why can’t he just be honest and say: ‘Listen, I’ve earned £20m, I’ve pissed it up the wall, I’ve gone through a few things and I need to get more money.’ Just be humble and say it. I wouldn’t be fighting. My legacy is secure. I don’t give a shit if everyone remembers me or not. That’s what these fights are about. Money. Don’t get me wrong: I want to win, and I’ll do whatever it takes. But I know what I’m saying: he’s back for money.”Haye’s response was quick and quiet. “People have been saying that for years.” For the only time in his career, Haye has been out-talked this week. As Salas says: “Actions speak louder than words.” And there will be more of the former on Saturday night, with the latter reserved to announce the winner. I expect that to be Haye, pushed near to the limit over 12 rounds, and maybe persuaded that, finally, he has survived long enough in this business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cead1bf9f76ff93c117bba504eaec77d348bedf/51_0_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c827c7a24c2b8302d0dc894c514e23f","title":"elisabeth moss handmaids tale this is happening in real life wake up people","story":"As the Golden Globe-winning drama returns, the creators and cast of the show discuss the new horrors on the horizon, and how it’s become a symbol of new resistance“We knew that we were doing something important,” says Samira Wiley, reflecting on the feelings of the cast and creators of The Handmaid’s Tale in the months running up to the show’s launch last spring. “We knew that we were making something with a lot of integrity. But we definitely didn’t mean for it to be that timely and that relevant.” Nine months later, the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s seminal dystopian novel was not only sweeping the boards at every awards ceremony – remarkable for a new show, with such dark, brutal themes – but had rapidly become a social phenomenon, too: a symbol of the new resistance, with the handmaids’ uniform co-opted by protesters at US courthouses, on marches, and in Hollywood itself.“When we were arriving at the Golden Globes, there were a bunch of handmaids outside,” recalls Wiley, who plays Moira, rebellious best friend of the main protagonist Offred. The group, calling themselves the Hollywood Handmaids, were holding a silent protest to demand an end to sexual assaults and inequalities in the industry.“It has been absolutely crazy,” says Wiley, shaking her head in disbelief.Certainly, the fervour surrounding the series is unprecedented, which is all the more exceptional considering that Atwood wrote the story in 1984. There have been previous adaptations, too: a 1990 film written by Harold Pinter and starring Natasha Richardson, plus an opera and a ballet. But none have sparked the torrent of memes, slogan T-shirts bearing lines from the book, and even, apparently, tattoos of its quotable mantras.On a sub-zero day in Toronto, Canada, I visit the set of the show to meet the cast and creators. Such is the secrecy surrounding the production that all correspondence with the team regarding my visit refers to the show as “Rocket Woman”, a security measure designed to avert overexcited fans, but also any fundamentalist groups who might object to its themes, I am told. As season one ended exactly as the novel did – with a pregnant Offred bundled into a van – this second series will not be Atwood’s story, moving beyond the content of the classic text. She is a consultant on the show, and approves the scripts. However, “that doesn’t mean I have veto power”, the author recently told Newsweek. “No one would ever give an author that you’d be really foolish to do so.” That simultaneously bestows both freedom and pressure on the show’s writers, on top of already enormous expectations.“The way we made the first season, which was in great ignorance, is exactly the way we’re trying to make the second season,” says showrunner Bruce Miller, as he shows me around the sprawling set. “We try not to think about people out there dissecting it, but instead just think about making something that’s cool.’Elisabeth Moss, a producer on the show as well as its star, also points out that the first season was not a simple facsimile of the book, either: timelines were altered, some details were changed, while partial sentences were extrapolated from the text to create entire scenes and stories. “We were faithful to the idea and the tone and the messages of the book,” she says, “but we kept characters alive that died and we did things that were never in the book, so we’re not afraid of that.”Miller admits that, while the writers did not seek to weave threads from current news events – such as the #MeToo movement – into the story, it is impossible not to be influenced by the political and social context in which The Handmaid’s Tale is made and consumed. “I try to let the audience figure out the relationship between the show and the real world, and how it’s interpreted and where it’s put in a political context,” he says. “But one of the things the writing staff brought this year was that – because of the more polarised discussions happening all over the world, but especially in the US, including the #MeToo movement – you’re starting to hear people verbalise things you didn’t think people thought any more.”This season will also see an expansion of the world that Atwood created: the Colonies, the toxic waste dumps to which “Unwomen” are exiled and Little America, in Canada, where refugees from Gilead are living. “There’s also a scene that addresses journalism in Gilead,” says Moss. “It’s really intense. But it needs to be addressed. Because, what would have happened to journalists?” she asks, rhetorically.For Fiennes, whose character has sex with Offred every month, against her will, in a bid to get her pregnant, the burden of playing a rapist – albeit one committing an act sanctioned by the ruling order – does not sit easily. “I am repulsed by it,” he says, simply. “I am very affected by some of the things we have to do, this season in particular, I have found some of it very difficult.”In seeking to build an authentic world beyond that outlined in the book, Miller and his team drew – as Atwood did in her original story – on history, creating a meticulously detailed mythology for Gilead. This explains why the outwardly pious Commanders of the Faith have based themselves in Cambridge, Massachusetts, north of Boston, rather than Washington DC. “It’s not the traditional seat of power, but in America it’s the seat of intellectual power, and Boston has such a huge place in our Puritan history,” Miller explains. He says he has an unusual advantage in being able to question Atwood directly about her own inspirations. “Usually when you adapt a classic, the author is long gone,” says Miller. “But not only is Margaret very much around, she also has a spectacular memory about what she was thinking when she wrote The Handmaid’s Tale.”One criticism levelled at the first season was the show’s depiction of race. While Miller deliberately created a multiracial world (unlike in the original book, in which minorities had been exiled), the show did not deal with, or mention, racism. Among other critical voices, New York magazine described this as the show’s “greatest failing”. How those criticisms have been taken on board in the storylines for season two remains to be seen, but some cast members say that such issues are influencing their performances.“I watched a lot of movies on slavery, just to see how characters moved,” says Amanda Brugel, the mixed-race actor who plays Rita, one of Gilead’s low-ranking domestic servants, whose story will be more prominent this season. “I especially watched the women who were slaves, versus a character in our show like Serena Joy, who’s lived a life of freedom. I very much lean on past experiences in which I felt like I have actually been a different class, and a slave, in situations just because of my colour,” she says.Moss and I speak again, a few weeks after my visit to the set, on the day of the March for Our Lives, held across US cities and organised by the surviving students of the Parkland school shootings. Donald Trump has suggested, as a solution to the growing tide of similar tragedies, arming teachers in schools. “When I heard that, I got chills,” says Moss. “Because I’m on set with a man pretending to hold a machine gun, in a situation that he just shouldn’t have one in.”The parallels between the current rapid militarisation of the US and Gilead are undeniable.“In the book, Margaret calls it the new normal,” Moss continues. “It’s a line that Aunt Lydia says – this will all be normal to you one day. That’s scary to me.” She has no tolerance, however, for people who find the show itself frightening. “I hate hearing that someone couldn’t watch it because it was too scary,” she says. “Not because I care about whether or not they watch my TV show I don’t give a shit. But I’m like, ‘Really? You don’t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.’”The Handmaid’s Tale returns to Channel 4 in May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d77e3b19842a5b4b3b0fdbd6baaed8ae579433ba/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f2e849b9e69a26055e960571fd4c732","title":"hawaii evacuations ordered as kilauea volcano erupts","story":"Lava spurts through cracks in roads and flows in residential areas on Big Island before earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.4 and 6.9 reportedA whole town has been ordered to evacuate after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island caused lava to flow in residential areas, followed by two large earthquakes.All 1,500 inhabitants of Pahoa were told to leave after steam and lava poured out of a crack in the nearby Leilani Estates. Lava spurted into the sky from the road and aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest. On Friday afternoon, a 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit the island followed by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake about an hour later, officials reported.A resident, Ikaika Marzo, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread over an area about 180 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday. He said it sounded like a jet engine.Residents had been warned for the last week that they should prepare to evacuate, with officials saying an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres were providing shelter.Earlier in the week, a school in the Puna district was closed due to the continuing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain.Since Monday, hundreds of earthquakes – most of them about 2.0 magnitude – have been recorded in the area. The Puu Oo, which is a volcanic cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kīlauea volcano, began to collapse on Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into newly created underground chambers.Officials said it was impossible to predict how long the eruption would last. The volcano had burned two homes, authorities said. Jeremiah Osuna, who captured drone footage of the lava stream, told the Honolulu television station KOHN that it sounded as if someone “put a bunch of rocks into a dryer”. He said he could smell the sulphur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.The US Geological Survey said fresh cracks in the ground were reported on Thursday afternoon and hot vapour and lava began to erupt.The geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed below Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night. The Hawaii county civil defence agency closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.After the second major earthquake, there were no immediate reports of significant damage, and the Hilo airport and highways did not face major impacts, according to the Associated Press. There were also no reports of damage. The earthquake wasn’t strong enough to cause a tsunami, and no tsunami threat or advisory has been put in place, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes national park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high.

After years of cuts to teachers’ wages and education budgets, teachers across the US have taken action – walking out on the job in states including West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona. More strikes are planned and the teachers have become empowered by material gains in wages and funding as legislators scramble to get them back to work.The strides women have made in the private sector have left female teachers far behind.Amy Vizino is a 42-year-old special education paraprofessional living in Tucson, Arizona who makes $11 an hour. Her job is tough and often involves physical assaults on her by students with emotional disorders. “There is a lot of violence. I’ve been spit on, had stuff thrown at you, horrible words, bites, kicked. The teacher we work for has had a concussion twice,” said Vizino. “I probably have to restrain a kid twice a week – it’s horrible. “It’s a lot of work and a lot of stress that I take home because I love them. I care about them and I feel like I come home to my kids and I’m all sapped because, you know, I work my butt off,” she said.As a single mother with three kids and making only $11 an hour, Vizino is forced to live with her mother in order to make ends meet. She says that despite the pay she still enjoys the work. “I love kids and I’m really good at it so I feel passionate, but if nothing changes I am going to have to find something else,” said Vizino. Vizino said she went out on strike to fight for higher funding for paraprofessionals like herself, who make poverty wages. “I am willing to hold out and not go back in until something gets done.”Kristin Beller is a kindergarten teacher in Wake County, North Carolina. She is helping to organize a massive effort to encourage teachers to use a personal day to take off work on 16 May. Instead of showing up for work, Beller is part of an effort backed by the North Carolina Association of Educators to use that day of missed work to hold a massive rally on the first day of the state general assembly. Beller said that in the past the union had done lobby days, but never went so far as to encourage members to take off personal days en masse. She said she was inspired to push for more militant action after watching the successful teachers’ strike in West Virginia. “We saw Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arizona of course, and that momentum that has been building in these ‘right-to-work states’ is inspiring,” said Beller. Teachers in North Carolina, who were legally barred from collective bargaining, have had trouble attracting members, who don’t see the union as providing much support. “For years, people would say you don’t have a real union in North Carolina, but what we have been saying for so long is that a union is a group of people that come together with similar struggles and decide together to choose something better for themselves” said Beller.Now, though, they are attracting new members because the union is taking more direct action. “If we want to be a union, we must act like a union,” said Beller. “We may not have collective bargaining rights, but we can act like a union. What we have seen in other states is just because something isn’t legal doesn’t mean we can’t do it.”“We are done being the frog that is being boiled,” said Beller. “We are ready to show up on 16 May and make a show of power and strength.”Melissa Espindola is a 24-year-old chemistry teacher at Pueblo high school, a low-income school in Tucson in her second year of teaching. Espindola said that she was inspired to walk out over the difficulties that she has in getting resources for her classroom. She says that seeing teachers in West Virginia successfully strike persuaded her that teachers in Arizona could also successfully strike. “I think it gave us power and it gave us hope that if they can do it, we can do it,” said Espindola. Last Thursday, Espindola took part in a 50,000 person rally which stormed the Arizona state capitol, a rally that was nearly 10 times as big as the first rallies held during the West Virginia teachers’ strike. “It was so powerful and I am so happy to be part of history in making,” said Espindola. Like many young teachers, the difficulties of teaching in under-resourced schools has led her to think about quitting, but she says being involved in the movement to improve education has made her more upbeat about wanting to stay in the teaching profession over the long haul. “This movement makes me more excited to be doing this for the rest of my life,” said Espindola. “It just feels like we have so much support now. I am so glad that all the teachers got together and decided to start this movement and finally make a change in education.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998185944414b2304b5c4ba2b266c40c6509930c/0_16_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=733f297362ab320127d1c96025d97f81","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

The free tickets, worth up to £400 each, will be offered to any EU citizens who turn 18 before July as part of a pilot DiscoverEU scheme funded by the EU. With Brexit on the horizon this is the first and last year British teenagers can apply for the rail bonanza, which has just been launched in Brussels.“Any future participating depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” said Nathalie Vandystadt, the EU commission spokesperson for education, culture, youth and sport.The scheme has been masterminded by the German MEP and leader of the European People’s party in the European parliament, Manfred Weber. His long-term vision is to give a free Interrail pass to each child in an EU country when they turn 18 as part of a way of promoting cultural and social ties among EU citizens. “I am convinced that the ‘18th birthday’ Interrail pass for Europe could become a true flagship project for the development of a common European identity in ersity,” he said. Interrail was launched in 1972 with £27.50 tickets offering unlimited travel across Europe as part of a scheme by rail operators to tempt young Europeans to explore their home continent.The European commission and the European parliament hope to give those with the least chance of travel the opportunity for what they believe will be a formative experience of their lives.“Emotions and links between people is something that is also worth investing in. This is what the DiscoverEU project is about. The point of the initiative is to give young Europeans, including those who are not students, the opportunity to travel, discover the beauty and richness of our continent and meet with other young Europeans from all over Europe. I believe it can contribute to create a feeling of common amongst Europeans,” Weber said.The EU has earmarked €12m (£10.6m) for the for the pilot scheme this year with a further €700m pencilled in for the next seven years in the proposed EU €1.25tn budget for 2021-2027.The first application round for 15,000 tickets will take place between 12 June and 26 June. If successful another 15,000 passes will be released in the second half of the year. About 1,900 tickets have been earmarked for British applicants, with 2,500 for Germany, 1,960 for France and 140 for Ireland. Sources say these allocations may change depending on take up from each member state. Participants will be able to travel up to 30 days to up to four EU countries with rail and ferries included. Their trip should be connected to a place with a specific value in terms of European cultural heritage, European sites, places of historic interest, specific social or cultural values and traditions. Applicants will have to give reasons for why they should be awarded the Interrail pass and agree to act as European ambassadors by posting about their experiences on social media.

The message, not the messenger, was of primary importance the posters were “weapons of the struggle”, not for decoration or display in “bourgeois places of culture” and certainly not for sale – ever. Fifty years on, as France marks the anniversary of May 1968 with a new wave of strikes and student protests, the leftwing idealism of the Atelier Populaire has been trumped by the commerical instincts of the free market. Today the posters are on display in museums and for sale at auctions and galleries across the world with prices topping £2,000.Currently there are exhibitions at the Musée de Beaux-Arts in Paris, and on sale at the Royal Academy’s London Original Print Fair, the Tate Modern and at Lazinc gallery in Mayfair. The dealer, Gerrish Fine Art, has amassed more than 150 rare and original Atelier Populaire posters, some of which are on sale at the RA fair for between £350 and and £2,250 each.“These icons of rebellion and civil disorder are the forerunners of today’s thriving street art movement. As monuments to the intense power of the image to bring about change, they represent one of the most potent and striking graphic revolutions in history – fierce symbols of art at the service of insurrection,” it writes.Art experts now predict a boom in demand for the work that is credited as an inspiration for punk art in the 1970s and Banksy today.Not everyone is delighted by this belated critical recognition. The French political scientist, Thomas Guénolé, a member of the hard-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is shocked, but not surprised.“We have a civilisation that cannot accept that there are some things that have no price,” Guénolé told the Observer.“The Atelier Populaire was vehemently opposed to the posters being sold, clearly declaring it was unacceptable to make money from them. But we are in a society where everything is for sale: workers, culture, museums, public services, our private lives … it’s hardly a surprise that great symbols like this become nothing more than goods to be sold. We see the same with Che Guevara’s image.”In the spring of 1968, as student protests spread to the Sorbonne and strikes paralysed France, Atelier Populaire produced around 500 different posters reflecting opposition to President Charles de Gaulle, the government, the police, media and capitalism. Printed on newspaper rolls supplied by striking printers, the images were simple but powerful. As the weeks went on they developed a collective style.Gérard Fromanger, an Atelier artist, said in 1988: “We were having great fun, we lived in the school day and night, it was passionate … and we were the only ones working, which was gratifying. The whole country was on strike except us. We never worked so hard in our lives. We were printing day and night.”The École was cleared by police in the early hours of 28 June, 1968. They found a few pots of paint and a handful of posters, but not the secret printing press they were seeking.Georgie Gerrish, of Gerrish Fine Art, who has spent 12 years collecting Atelier Populaire posters, says their message is still relevant. “Everyone is realising how historically important they are. They are from a magic moment full of hope and the idea that if we pulled together we could bring about monumental change. I suppose it does seem strange selling them, but we are now 50 years on, and perhaps the motives for not selling them are not so strong.”Guénolé, a strong supporter of the ongoing wave of public sector strikes in France, said their sale is “sacrilege”.He added: “If you consider the values they represent, then selling one of these posters for £2,000 is a misuse of something sacred. And their messages are relevant today, so much so I am using them to make a point about today’s protests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35c0aa4dac86b97beae2bf0f227b066dccbc392/80_212_2406_1444/master/2406.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84553d9dc3d1db11f55f97901cfc3baa","title":"iraqi refugee edwin shuker british jews first leader arab origin","story":"The most influential organisation representing British Jews could soon have its first leader from a Mizrahi – or Arab – background.Edwin Shuker, one of four candidates campaigning to be the next president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, was born in Baghdad before fleeing persecution and arriving in Britain as a refugee.Shuker, whose first language is Arabic, says the board, which has played a crucial role in recent controversies about antisemitism in Britain, must be more erse and inclusive, and is in urgent need of a change of culture to pay more attention to grassroots concerns within the community. “I want to be a voice for the community, and the authority of that voice comes from carrying all parts of the community, their concerns and aspirations, with you,” he told the Observer.Shuker was born into a dwindling Jewish community in Iraq in 1955. Amid rising tensions in 1971 he escaped with his parents, grandmother and two sisters through the Kurdish mountains into Iran before coming to the UK as a United Nations refugee. He later lived in Israel for six\u0026nbspyears.He said his bond with the Middle East was “total and continuing”: “My identity is as a Jew from Arabia, and an Arabic and Hebrew speaker.”Acknowledging that his background could be a challenge in next Sunday’s election, he said: “It would be a huge cultural step for British Jewry to accept an oriental with a foreign accent to be their president. But I hope we are mature enough for that.”Shuker praised the actions of Jonathan Arkush, the BoD’s current president, who has joined forces with the Jewish Leadership Council to forcefully tackle Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the Labour party.“When Jews stand together, we are a powerful force, and that has been demonstrated in recent weeks. But I don’t want our brilliant, creative, vibrant community to be defined by antisemitism or by our enemies.”There were issues of great importance at grassroots level in the community, such as the inclusion of women and the challenges of an ageing community, he said.“We need to use the example of the antisemitism campaign to demonstrate how much clearer our voice is when we leave our differences behind. There are people who feel their voice is not heard and their presence is irrelevant. I want to change that culture.”The BoD leadership was “top down, and I want to make it bottom up,” he said. “We need to listen and unite, and not only when the community is facing an outside danger, but also on issues that are just as important to the welfare of British Jews but aren’t getting as much attention.”The current campaign against antisemitism in the Labour party was of critical importance, “but I don’t think it can be sustained with such intensity in the long term. We need to look beyond the next headline to other methods of combating antisemitism, such as education in schools.“We need to build alliances with as wide a range of British society as possible – political parties, Christian, Muslim and other faith communities – against every form of racism. Let’s use this crisis as an opportunity to root out any attack on religion, gender and so on.”He said criticism of the actions of the Israeli government was legitimate, but that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement “crosses a red line” into antisemitism because it sought to delegitimise the state of Israel itself.There were iniduals within the UK Jewish community who took issue with Israeli government policies and actions, he said. But it was the job of the BoD president to represent the whole community, and it would be inappropriate for the leadership to publicly criticise Israel. There are four candidates in the BoD election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c88b335b99b25984992aa6ffe78cf1a118d1106/0_285_4829_2898/master/4829.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3e180941a43b4efe00bf816fc7fbf9","title":"israel pulls out of race for seat on un security council","story":"Three-way contest averted, meaning Germany and Belgium will likely take thetwo available positions on UN’s most powerful bodyFacing an uphill struggle in an election next month, Israel has announced it is pulling out of a race for a seat on the UN security council.Israel was in a three-way contest with Germany and Belgium for two seats representing the western-democratic group of nations on the UN’s most powerful body starting in January.The security council has five permanent members – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – and 10 members elected by the 193-member general assembly for two-year terms.Israel’s UN mission said in a statement that “after consulting with our partners, including our good friends, the state of Israel has decided to postpone its candidacy for a seat on the security council”.“It was decided that we will continue to act with our allies to allow for Israel to realise its right for full participation and inclusion in decision-making processes at the UN,” the statement said. “This includes the security council as well as an emphasis on areas related to development and innovation.”Israel’s withdrawal virtually guarantees Germany and Belgium victory in the 8 June election and seats on the council.Candidates for non-permanent seats on the council are chosen by regional groups and for 55 years Israel was not part of a regional group, which barred it from many UN positions.The late US ambassador Richard Holbrooke succeeded in 2000 in getting the western European and others regional group known as WEOG to invite Israel to be a temporary member, which later was extended indefinitely.Israel announced its withdrawal minutes before WEOG candidates were scheduled to appear and answer questions from UN member states.Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said in response to a question about Israel’s withdrawal: “We have never run against a country. There is nothing where we really oppose each other. We went for our own programme. We asked support, and we want also to seek high support from you.”He noted there had been a lot of discussion at the UN on how regional groups should put forward candidate countries. “I’m in favour of having more candidates,” Heusgen said, even though “this is tougher” because candidates then have to say what they stand for and respond to sometimes tough questions about their country. “So therefore ... I regret that Israel withdrew from the race,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577420abbaafd10686967b356e2a4802d84d55c2/0_182_5237_3142/master/5237.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc1cdc7e0e09f1f18b7d77efa7f0ea4","title":"lebanon election likely to reaffirm status quo","story":"Law change was meant to make room for political plurality but old traditions of patronage are hard to break downNine years and two collapsed governments since the last election, Lebanon goes to the polls on Sunday with leaders touting a new beginning for a country bedevilled by debt and dysfunction, but voters fearing more of the same.The long-awaited parliamentary election had been hailed as a potential turning point for a state beset by decades of war, a turbulent domestic scene and a neighbouring crisis that has posed new threats. As polling day has drawn nearer, however, it has become increasingly likely that the result will reaffirm the status quo of a powerful, elite-run patronage network with entrenched channels of influence.For opponents of prime minister Saad Hariri’s government, this spells trouble. “The country is going through serious social, economic and political challenges that will translate into disastrous consequences if the same elite runs the country, with the same mindset that it did the last 30 years,” said Gilbert Doumit, a candidate in Beirut for a new list, Kulna Watani. A complicated electoral law drafted for the vote was supposed to give more room for plurality and merit-based candidates to emerge in a political scene that has taken root around civil war-era former warlords and sectarian leaders. Established political blocs, however, rather than newcomers, look set to benefit from the high threshold required to win a seat.The result could continue to marginalise candidates standing on civil society platforms. One such campaign, Beirut Madinati, emerged during municipal elections three years ago but has since made little impact away from the capital. Lebanon’s large working class population remains wedded to the traditional structures, analysts say. That means a showdown, in some form, between two rival blocs that emerged after the assassination of the former prime minister Rafiq Hariri in February 2005. Dubbed March 8 – a pro-Syria and Hezbollah movement – and March 14 – a pro-western counterpart – the two movements have dominated Lebanese politics ever since.March 14 was briefly ascendant until 2008, despite more than a dozen of its loyalists, including MPs, journalists, and security officials, being killed. Since then, the powerful Hezbollah has dominated Lebanese affairs. The reluctance of political rivals to challenge the group in any other forum but a national poll is testament to its power.“For many in Lebanon, the salons of leaders’ palaces are the gateway to the state,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, the communications director of the Carnegie Middle East centre in Beirut. “In the case of Hezbollah, this process takes the form of a network of institutions, hospitals, schools, higher education institutes, religious seminaries, social services and publishing. “The party is the country’s largest publisher, and the second largest employer after the state. So when we talk of a challenge by independents and civil society to the state in this elections, we have to bear in mind that fair competition is non-existent, and the caps on spending don’t apply to the big players, who either draw on the government’s resources, or regional funding to maintain their large and effective networks.“The power of the Lebanese political elite, comprised of former warlords and sectarian leaders, is based on the client-list networks. Basically, the sectarian leaders take on the functions of the state, mostly through its institutions, providing public jobs and services to their constituencies.”After five years of self-imposed exile, the figurehead of March 14, Saad Hariri, returned to Lebanon in late 2016 to form a government. That led to the election of a president, the March 8 icon Michel Aoun, who partnered Hezbollah and won the group’s endorsement. Ever since, the country has been perceived to have been in the orbit of March 8 – informally allied to Iran, and on slowly warming ties with Syria despite a formal policy of disassociation.In late 2017 Saudi leaders, who until then had been Hariri’s patrons, summoned the prime minister to Riyadh and told him to resign. They had taken umbrage at what they saw as Iranian consolidation under his new government – a sign of just how sensitive the fragile state is to regional dynamics and what little room it has to manoeuvre by itself, even if it tried. Once back in Lebanon, Hariri announced he was suspending the resignation he had tendered while in Saudi Arabia and, aside from that chapter, his return has brought relative stability to the country. It has done little, however, to address rampant corruption, nepotism and soaring national debt. Almost all public services remain poor, and there is popular resentment at festering piles of rubbish and regular power cuts.“The powerful remain committed to this electricity debacle because they are invested in the current system,” one senior political figure said. “They are running diesel through gas plants. There are kickbacks involved.”Hage Ali said that current levels of corruption and inefficiency were not sustainable but that “the status quo is not capable of reforming itself”.Doumit, the Julna Watani candidate, said: “If the same political elite and their allies are all re-elected, then the status quo will mean a continuation of unacceptable electricity cuts, lack of a reliable water supply, and a very poor waste management system that leaves garbage rotting in the streets. “Whatever the outcome, we will continue fighting to achieve proper representation and accountability mechanisms that the Lebanese people deserve.”Fouad Makhzoumi, a Sunni candidate and potential rival to Hariri, said: “If change doesn’t happen, Lebanon has a bleak future. My feeling is that this election will start the process, but it needs another election to truly put the country on a new path.”Daniella Daou, a 21-year-old political science graduate, said civil society candidates still stood to make an impact, even if they failed to win seats. “With the exposure they get now, they will probably have influence as lobby groups. The electoral districts, though, have been drawn to fit the warlords.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918ffb0e1760c0fecd9f14b3629ee77682cb3d46/0_210_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2e123cab3afd220efbb90093f0e787","title":"ruffled feathers feral peacocks split community in canada","story":"Tensions have come to a head over the fate of dozens of wild peacocks that have taken up residence on a city streetFor a decade, a group of feral peacocks have ided the community of Sullivan Heights. Some of the residents of this suburban neighbourhood outside Vancouver love the birds, who have taken up residence in the local trees others say they are kept awake by the peacocks’ screeching. For Parminder Brar, the final straw came last year, when he says his father injured himself slipping on peacock excrement on Brar’s property. He formally issued a request to take down the tree where the peacocks had built a nest. The city turned him down.So, this week, Brar cut down the tree himself.The move has sparked a furore in Sullivan Heights, angering his neighbours and potentially earning Brar a fine of up to $10,000.“The majority of us love them. They add value to the neighbourhood,” says Katie Taylor, who has lived on the street for 12 years. Unlike their native counterpart, the Canada geese who periodically stop by and can be aggressive, the peacocks have proven to be peaceful neighbours.“We haven’t seen any aggression from the peacocks,” Taylor says. “You can feed them from your hands.”Many of the residents on the Sullivan Heights community Facebook page feel less warmly towards the birds. Complaints to the city authorities have been submitted since as far back as 2009, after a nearby farm where the peacocks used to feed closed down and the birds chose to relocate to Sullivan Heights.The city initially responded by sending animal control staff to round up the peacocks and release them elsewhere. But the birds kept returning.Ultimately, the issue was dropped because the community was split over whether to let the birds stay. “It’s a legal grey area,” says Jaspreet Rehal, the city’s public safety manager. “They don’t fall squarely into any animal control rules, regulations and bylaws.” Nevertheless, he says Brar’s decision to take the law into his own hands was wrong. “Cutting down the tree was not an option. It was a very healthy tree, it was important to the environment around it and we take tree removal very seriously.”The next step, Rehal says, is to convene a consultation with the community as a whole to decide what to do, with the likely result that the peacocks are relocated. For now, the birds have taken to perching on Brar’s roof."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475796.1524775142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"skylarks stunned me just like the poets the bird has hoisted into verse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe lark ascending: the skylark has hoisted countless poets into verse. Illustration: Michael VineyMy first encounter with a singing skylark, a few decades ago, put me flat on my back on the moss of the dunes – a proper posture for awe.The bird had sprung, as larks do, almost from under my feet and spiralled up to hang as a speck in the clear air, pouring out a ceaseless flow of whistlings and trillings that seemed to stun the whole hillside into listening. They certainly stunned me, just like the countless poets the skylark has hoisted into verse.One could look to science (flight up to 100m, wings fluttering at 10 to 12 beats a second, sonagram with up-and-down pitch pattern between 2kHz and 5.5kHz over about six seconds, average song up to two or three minutes but can go on for six). Or could simply settle for Shelley: “Higher still and higher  From the earth thou springest . . . And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.”A lot more is assembled online by a sensitive American blogger, who didn’t, one gathers, vote for Trump. There are further from Cecil Day-Lewis (“Be strong your fervent soaring, your skyward air!  Tremble there, a nerve of song!”) and a typically ecstatic tongue-twister from Gerard Manley Hopkins (“Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,  His rash-fresh re-winded new skeinèd score  In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour  And pelt music, till none’s to spill or spend”).Ted Hughes, whose skylark may have soared in Connemara, is predictably darker: “The lark begins to go up  Like a warning  As if the globe were uneasy . . .  You stop to rest, far up, you teeter  Over the drop . . .  Then up and up and up  Like a mouse with drowning fur  Bobbing and bobbing at the well-wall”.The globe is indeed uneasy, as one in eight of its bird species is threatened with extinction. As farming intensifies, Europe’s skylarks are down by almost half, and in Ireland by 30 per cent, since 1970.It is no longer breeding in many parts of the south and east, its nesting retreating to the uplands and coastal margins and islands. On the grassy machair behind the dunes, below me, Michael Longley has pictured the spring tide “seeping after sun and moon  To pour cupfuls into the larks’ nests”.An English skylark researcher, Eric Simms, a sound recordist as well as ornithologist, began all this more than half a century ago. He organised the synchronised recording, in early June 1951, of the spread of the dawn chorus across the UK.Skylarks anticipated the rise in light as it rolled across these islands from northeast to southwest. Their first song was recorded at 01.30 GMT in Scotland’s Cairngorms, 01.51 in Northumberland, 02.20 in Kent, 02.27 in Staffordshire, 02.28 in Co Antrim, 02.33 in Lancashire (a bit late in industrial haze) and 02.36 in south Wales.At RTÉ Derek Mooney and his Mooney Goes Wild team of experts pioneered the broadcasting of the Irish dawn chorus some two decades ago, then extended live transmission across Europe through links with other presenters as far as Russia.In 2016 this triumphant capture of the exquisite avian sound, with human commentary in a murmur of national accents, won the programme the Rose d’Or award for the European radio event of the year. Tomorrow’s dawn chorus will track the songs of myriad species, from the tropics to the tundra, in their first welcome to the day.For some of Ireland’s skylarks, meanwhile, there is promise of a better future. In the Bride Valley of east Cork – where, I’m told, the bird is “just hanging on in pockets here and there” – a five-year pilot project has been launched to reward tillage and dairy farmers for actions encouraging wildlife.In the logo of the new Bride Project (“Farming with Nature”) a skylark is poised above bands of green and gold, denoting the grass and cornfields that comprise its ideal habitat. Farm management plans will offer the birds patches of ungrazed pasture to nest in, and unsprayed stubble fields for winter feed.A Scottish skylark researcher, Diane Hendry, wrote an anxious poem about her job: “I worry that skylarks have been expelled,  become dissident birds.  I try to pretend they are simply out  of fashion, like Shelley  but secretly I am afraid  they have been hushed up”.In Bride Valley, let’s hope, they’ll soon be back in full number, and “soaring ever singest”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Teenager questioned after 38-year-old sustains \u0026lsquoextremely grave\u0026rsquo head injuryVariety of opinions on vote among church-goers - Association of Catholic PriestsSimon Harris said he would review consent for HSE director general if conflict of interestStrength of support for repeal noticeable across all age groups but apathy is the enemyMultimillion euro agreement follows \u0026lsquohorrific week\u0026rsquo for women in IrelandBusinesses on O\u0026rsquoConnell Street using high-pitched \u0026lsquomosquito alarms\u0026rsquo to combat loiteringFamily who lost two daughters at the hospital brought the case due to delay in reportUS campaigners in favour of retaining Eighth Amendment have faced \u0026lsquohateful\u0026rsquo commentsIreland set to block negotiation on EU-UK trade deal if no pact on customs unionPilot trapped in cockpit of damaged aircraft which came down three miles from BallinaPolitical support drains away from HSE director general Tony O\u0026rsquoBrienMan (33) arrested for attack on member of Armed Regional Support Unit in GalwayBusinesses and householders find persistent difficulties with cover in spite of major worksEvents include Ed Sheeran gigs in Cork and Temple Bar celebration of Baltic DayGalway East Deputy has left Independent Alliance but will remain on Government benchesElaine Hughes says she believes her son was bullied online due to colour of his skinSome 40 people, paying \u0026euro300 each per month, asked to leave for fire safety reasonsYoung man from \u0026lsquoextraordinarily good family\u0026rsquo first accessed child porn at 16"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485744.1525517117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"priests group calls for end to referendum campaigners speaking at mass","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe ACP said said it encouraged people to find out what exactly they are being asked to vote for, and what the consequences of their vote may be. Photograph: iStockGetty ImagesThe Association of Catholic Priests (ACP) has called for an end to the practice of allowing referendum campaigners to speak at Mass. In a statement, the association said it was “concerned” that in the run up to the referendum on the Eighth Amendment, some parishes were allowing their pulpits to be used by campaigners. The ACP said such a practice would be regarded by some Church-going Catholics as “inappropriate and insensitive” and “an abuse of the Eucharist”. It said that while it fully endorses “the Catholic teaching that all human life, from beginning to end, is sacred”, it also recognises that “human life is complex, throwing up situations that are more often grey than black and white and that demand from us a sensitive, non-judgemental, pastoral approach.” “There is undoubtedly a moral content to this referendum, but as with many other issues, there are also social, political and pastoral dimensions.”It said that as as an association made up of unmarried, childless men, “we are not best placed to be in any way dogmatic on this issue”.The association said it encouraged people to find out what exactly they are being asked to vote for, and what the consequences of their vote may be. “Having done that to the best of our ability, and following it with the, often painful and difficult, task of consulting our conscience, let us cast our vote. “A vote cast in accordance with each person’s conscience, whatever the result, deserves the respect of all,” it said. The ACP is a voluntary association of Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland. It was established in 2010 with the objective of having “a forum, and a voice to reflect, discuss and comment on issues affecting the Irish Church and society today.” One of its founders, Fr Tony Flannery, was disciplined and banned from public ministry by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2012 for views he expressed on Catholic teachings in areas such as sexuality, contraception and the role of women in the church.Responding to the ACP statement, the Save the 8th group, which is campaigning against the repeal of the Eighth Amendment, said it had been “delighted and honoured” to accept invitations to speak to congregations.“The Association of Catholic Priests appears to be worried that Catholics may hear Catholic teaching reflected at Catholic masses,” it said. The group said it would never decline an invitation “educate” voters about which it described as the “extremity of the Government’s proposal, which legalises abortion for healthy mothers, and healthy babies, for any reason at all”.Save the 8th said no-one was compelled by a church or its campaign to listen to any speaker.“If we have reached the point where speaking about the right to life in a Christian church is in some way controversial, that would be a sign that hysteria has overtaken rational discourse in this referendum campaign,” it said.“Our campaign shares, and applauds, the deep commitment of the Christian community to the values of respect for the life and dignity of every human inidual. These values and beliefs are not limited to people of faith, and are shared by people of no religion whatsoever.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484741.1525524380!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sun set to shine for bank holiday weekend with highs of 21 degrees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Shine a Light on Summer Festival takes place over the weekend at five lighthouses – Fanad Head in Donegal Hook, the world’s oldest working lighthouse in Wexford (above) Loop Head and on the islands of Rathlin in Co Antrim and Valentia in Co Kerry.

The best temperatures will be in the midlands and the east on Monday.Today will see a “mix of good sunny spells and cloudy, misty periods”, according to Met Éireann. There will be top temperatures of 17 to 21 degrees.It will be mostly dry on Sunday with some cloud, but there will be “some good sunny spells at times too”. There will be top temperatures of 18 to 21 degrees.Met Éireann said it will be “still rather warm” on Monday, but turning cooler, fresher and more changeable from Tuesday. By early afternoon, “most places should have good sunny spells”. Top afternoon temperatures will range from 16 to 20 degrees.The bank holiday weekend will be one of the busiest of the year for both indoor and outdoor events.The Shine a Light on Summer Festival takes place over the weekend at five lighthouses – Fanad Head in Donegal Hook, the world’s oldest working lighthouse in Wexford Loop Head and on the islands of Rathlin in Co Antrim and Valentia in Co Kerry. The May the Fourth Festival which has a Star Wars theme takes place around the Skellig Experience visitor centre in Co Kerry over the weekend. The people of the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will have their day in the sun on Monday. There have been previous Baltic Days in Ireland with 5,000 turning out for the event in Merrion Square last year, but this year is likely to be the biggest to date as all three countries are celebrating their centenaries. They declared independence separately in 1918 from the Russian Empire. Nearly 60,000 immigrants from the three countries live in Ireland. According to the 2016 census, the largest number are from Lithuania (36,552), followed by Latvia (19,933) and Estonia (2,500). There will be traditional folk dancing and music from all three countries with a “taste of the Baltics” food market. Events take place between 12 noon and 5pm at Meeting House Square in Temple Bar. The biggest events of the bank holiday weekend will be the Ed Sheeran concerts in Cork’s Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Saturday and Sunday night.The first took place in balmy conditions on Friday night. A total of 120,000 fans will attend over the three days. There will be extra trains over the weekend to facilitate fans making their way home from the concert. It is predicted to be fine for the Great Limerick Run on Sunday. About 14,200 participants are expected to take part in the three races.There will be widespread disruption on Dart and train services north of Connolly Station over the bank holiday weekend to facilitate engineering works. There will be no Dart services between Connolly and HowthMalahide on Saturday and Sunday. On northern commuter routes, bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Malahide, with trains between Malahide and DroghedaDundalk running to a revised schedule.On the Belfast Enterprise train, bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Drogheda, with trains continuing to operate between Drogheda and Belfast.

Photograph: Dave MeehanA group of self-styled “pro-life activist journalists” have travelled from the US to lend their support to the anti-repeal side in the referendum on the Eight Amendment.The group, which runs an American pro-life organisation, says it plans to attend rallies by both sides, videoing them and putting the results online.Two activists, Emily Faulkner (23) and Nathan Berning (25), told The  they expect to be joined soon by seven associates.The pair live in Colorado where they run an anti-abortion organisation, LetThemLive.org, and are associated also with The Leadership Institute, a right-wing organisation in Virginia that seeks to recruit young people to conservative causes in the US.In an interview, they explained why they had come to Ireland and why they wanted to influence the referendum.Since announcing online last month that they were joining the retain campaign, they said they had been discouraged by “hateful” comments about them on Facebook. They were not working with any of the retain campaigns here, they said.“We haven’t had any success trying to connect with any of the pro-life organisations here,” said Mr Berning. “I think that’s mostly because there’s a fear it’s illegal for us to help them.”As a result, they had changed tack and would not be doing door-to-door canvassing, although they would do some “town centre” publicising, using images and diagrams showing development within the womb.“Our focus has shifted to being more journalist and documenting what happens so that we can show people back home,” said Mr Berning.Did this mean they saw themselves as journalists?“Absolutely!” said Ms Faulkner. “We do like to consider ourselves as pro-life journalists in like a kind of activist way.”Ms Faulkner, who says her family background is pro-life, studied biology and hopes to study gynaecology.“During my classes,” said Ms Faulkner, “we started talking about embryology and the beginning of life and I’m like ‘What! This is cool!’ Science is really amazing and I can fit that with my pro-life views.”Mr Berning said he was initially pro-choice in outlook until he went to college in Indiana, where he grew up.“There was a display of an aborted baby next to a penny, and I’m not sure what the age of the foetus was at that point, but I just saw it and it was very brutal to me and at first I think I was upset by the image,” he said.Both believe that life begins at the moment of conception and that abortion is wrong in all circumstances.Asked if they gave equal value to a fertilised egg, from the nanosecond after conception, and a 30-year-old woman, they said they did.“It has a unique DNA at the moment of conception,” said Mr Berning.Mr Berning: “It’s a person with potential.”“It is a human being. We were all there once,” said Ms Faulkner.Asked about the view of leading clinicians in Ireland that the Eighth Amendment has created legal uncertainty as to what they, as medics, can and cannot do, and is therefore a danger to women’s health, Ms Faulkner and Mr Berning said such situations were a tiny minority.What of the situation of a woman, whose pregnancy involved a fatal foetal abnormality incompatible with life, who wanted an abortion but could not get one in Ireland?“For us,” said Mr Berning, “I guess it comes down to, the percentage of the likelihood of something like that happening is so low, we don’t believe that you should legislate for that less than 1 per cent of pregnancies when it risks the 99 per cent.“There’s been over 100,000 abortions prevented in Ireland, if you compare it with the UK.”He computed this figure by calculating the number of abortions he estimates would have taken place in Ireland since 1983, had abortion been permitted here during that period and abortion rates been the same as the UK.No woman need be denied any medical treatment because of the Eighth, said Ms Faulkner. If in treating cancer, or dealing with an ectopic pregnancy, a foetus was adversely affected, that was not the intention and there was therefore “no direct killing of a child in the womb”.And as for competing but equal rights (as the amendment enunciates for both the unborn and the mother), a doctor should decide treatment, said Mr Berning, on the basis of “which life is more likely to survive and continue”.“From the medical perspective, that would be what I would argue to be the way to look at it,” he said. “Because, if the mother is about to die, then you should work to save the child. If the child is about to die and the mother has a chance of survival, then you work to save the mother. That’s pretty simple stuff.”On the case of Savita Halappanavar, who was refused an abortion during a miscarriage because of uncertainty relating to the amendment and who died of sepsis (blood poisoning), Ms Faulkner said the role of medics was relevant in the case also.“So if there was just a little bit more care . . . No need to legalise abortion but a little bit more care and attention.”“It’s an unfortunate reality that, you know, these things happen. People do die. It’s just part of life, I guess. That risk is always there,” he said.The pair, who are staying in an Airbnb in Tipperary, will this weekend attend a round of campaign events in Dublin.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484163.1525431259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bertie ahern s post politics decade you get the impression he really misses it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon Tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.   Photograph: David Sleator Bertie Ahern’s haunts are mostly still the same: Croke Park, Parnell Park – the home of Dublin GAA – and some pubs around the north side of Dublin where he toured throughout his political career.Yet some slight differences have emerged in the habits of the former taoiseach since he stood down from office a decade ago.Despite occasional appearances in Fagan’s – the Drumcondra pub which has framed pictures and newspaper clippings of Ahern and Bill Clinton toasting each other on its walls – he is said to no longer be a regular, but may occasionally make an appearance.“The lads behind the bar say it: ‘Never comes in anymore’,” said a local source. “He was last spotted there on All-Ireland final day.”A hostile atmosphere during the worst years of the recession perhaps encouraged Ahern to be cautious in where he socialises. He is now said to favour the discreet bar in the soccer club Home Farm. “The place would be empty – seven or eight people – but the Bert will be in there,” said another local. “I think he uses it for privacy.”The Goose Tavern and the Beaumont House still count on his regular custom, usually with old friends who have remained “100 per cent” loyal, according to those who know them.But – after years in which Bertie Ahern was viewed as something of a pariah – those around north Dublin detect a renewed confidence in Ahern as his reputation has improved. “When you see him coming out of Parnell Park now, there is a pep in his step even compared to two years ago. His head is held up high, he has a bit of the swagger back.”His interventions on Northern Ireland issues and Brexit have helped to rehabilitate him, although a recent interview with German television – which he walked out of when questions turned to the Mahon tribunal and his stewardship of the economy – served as a reminder that the most contentious issues of his past have not gone away.Speaking to The , Ahern himself says most criticism of him by members of the public in the years after his retirement mostly centred on the economy. “In the heat of the recession in 2009 and 2010, people would say: ‘If you had have done this or that’.” Issues around the tribunal, he says, are raised with him “very, very rarely”.Friends say a “bit of pride” meant Ahern was reluctant to discuss how his reputation had been damaged. “Even during the height of the recession, and at the peak of when he was getting stick, if you asked him about that, he’d never really admit it,” said one.But one particular memory from his days at the tribunal in Dublin Castle lingers around north Dublin, and will not be easily forgotten.The intricacies of his personal finances – aside from an easily mocked claim that he won significant sums betting on horses – have largely passed beyond common memory, but the treatment of Gráinne Carruth has not.Carruth, Ahern’s former constituency secretary who broke down while giving evidence about lodging thousands of pounds in sterling for her former boss, now lives with her family in a renovated St Luke’s, the former taoiseach’s Drumcondra base which she bought in 2015.“Even when people see him talking about Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement you’d still hear: ‘What about Gráinne Carruth and what he did to her?’” said a local.Ahern still keeps an office in Drumcondra, in modest rooms in a small business park. Most meetings are held across the road in the lobby or bar of the Skylon Hotel.He has been busy since leaving office. He briefly took to the after-dinner-speaking circuit and was on the boards of a few private sector companies but has largely focused on the area of conflict resolution, where his achievements are beyond dispute.Such pro bono work includes: spells with the World Economic Forum’s advisory group on conflict resolution the Clinton Global Initiative as a facilitator with Crisis Management Initiative, which saw him taking part in peace talks in Ukraine the Inter Mediate group established by Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief adviser and a period as co-chair of the InterAction Council of former world leaders.Ahern has also formed associations with various academic institutions including receiving an honorary professorship from NUI Maynooth. This week, he was in the Basque Country to mark the end of Eta, another step in a peace process to which he, along with others such as Gerry Adams, contributed.Recently, he has also been asked by the United Nations to chair Bougainville’s referendum commission ahead of a vote next year on whether the region should be independent of Papau New Guinea. Back home, he has helped settle disputes between the GAA and organisations in north Dublin.But Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.His possible re-entry into the party was raised as recently as last Wednesday night at a Dublin Central Comhairle Dáil Ceantair meeting. According to sources, an elderly delegate said that in order to secure a Dáil seat for Mary Fitzpatrick, the current Dublin Central candidate who clashed with Ahern on numerous occasions, the party should recruit all the help it could get, including allowing Ahern back.Ahern was sounded out about the prospect but cautioned against opening up such a contentious issue at this point. Micheál Martin shot down a similar proposal in November 2016, but many in the party would take Ahern back in a heartbeat.Last month, at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil national executive, talk turned to the prospect of the party standing a candidate in the presidential election – if there is to be one – later this year.Der Walsh, the delegate for Martin’s own Cork South Central constituency, told his leader that if the party is serious about standing for the presidency, it should send for Ahern. Unsurprisingly, Martin didn’t address the question.The current Fianna Fáil leader has a strained relationship with Ahern, who in turn finds it difficult to mask his dislike for the man he first appointed to Cabinet in 1997.Ahern’s occasional flirtations with a run for the presidency may be designed to cause trouble for Martin, or are a way of keeping his name connected with the Phoenix Park, in the off-chance that events turn his way.But friends insist he just wants his views on politics respected within the party he gave 40 years to. “I think he’d like to do the same around the party as he does with Brexit and the North,” says a friend, “to give advice”.“I don’t think he wants to run for office again. He was 40-odd years a member of the party. Most of his friends and most of his life has been around the party. I think he’d love to be of help. He doesn’t want to be on the frontline.”Ahern himself says: “If I was still in Fianna Fáil, the only thing I’d be doing would be in the local cumann.”To those around Ahern, the recent celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement offered the perfect opportunity for Martin to make a generous gesture of rapprochement.While Martin praised Ahern’s contributions to the peace process, it was felt that Fianna Fáil was attempting to claim credit for its achievements while continuing to disown one of its chief architects.“I have heard people in Fianna Fáil say: ‘We are the party of the Good Friday Agreement.’ You know Yeats’s famous line, how do you separate the dancer from the dance? Well, they are trying to do that.”As to when Ahern could return to Fianna Fáil fold, one supporter is blunt: “As soon as your man from Cork is gone.”All who encounter Ahern testify to his ongoing, intense interest in politics, from constituency level upwards.While he “f***ing hates Micheál Martin”, said one in regular contact with him, he is said to have a regard for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “He sees Leo as the same style of politician as himself.”“Bert still has the glint in his eye, the word for all the auld ones: ‘How yis doin girls? That type of thing.’ He still has a great grá for the day job. You get the impression he really misses it.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484659.1525460060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"increasing pessimism in dublin over prospects for brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt a  cabinet sub-committee meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday Mrs May failed to garner support for her plan for a “customs partnership” with the EU. Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergIrish Government expectations of a shift in the British position towards the customs union have been dashed in recent days, with senior figures in Dublin becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for a breakthrough in the talks before the June EU summit.Without movement in the British position the Government has been clear that it will block progress on further negotiations on an overall EU-UK trade deal and an agreement on a transition period.Officials are adamant that the EU strongly backs this position, raising the prospect of a collapse in the Brexit talks at or before the June summit.Several senior Irish sources have confirmed to The  during the past week that Downing Street had sent strong signals through back channels of an impending move in the British position, with sources mentioning cabinet office minister David Lidington and chancellor Philip Hammond as among those who had privately indicated to Dublin that a significant softening of the British position was imminent.However, the British also signalled growing problems with the “backstop” commitment, and hoped that a significant move on the customs union would lead to a easing of pressure from Dublin to enshrine the backstop into the withdrawal treaty.Under the backstop arrangement, which the British prime minister Theresa May gave in December and reiterated at the most recent EU summit in March, the British promised that in event there was no agreement between the EU and UK, it would ensure no ergence between customs and trade rules in the North and South.This has been interpreted by the EU as meaning that the North would remain in the customs union after Brexit – enraging some Conservatives and Northern Unionists.It is understood that the European Commission had also been informed of a likely shift in the British position and had signalled its approval.However, at a crucial cabinet sub-committee meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday Mrs May failed to garner support for her plan for a “customs partnership” with the EU, with Brexiteer ministers uniting to scupper the plan.According to high-level sources, Mrs May’s “customs partnership” plan did not meet the expectations in Dublin or Brussels, and instead resembled previous British suggestions that have been rejected by the EU side. In any event, Ms May could not generate sufficient support for the plan. Irish expectations that she was prepared to face down Brexiteer members of her cabinet – losing some if necessary – were left unfulfilled.There is now a high degree of pessimism in Dublin about the immediate future of the talks. Both the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney have said they will insist on significant progress on the inclusion of the backstop agreement in the legal text of the withdrawal treaty by the June summit or the trade talks cannot proceed.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483261.1525444227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judging bertie ahern we all partied but he served the drinks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBertie Ahern: will his achievements be eclipsed by his shortcomings?

In case anyone was wondering, wrote Mulcahy in a post with this photograph, he did not know whether O’Flynn, when attending future events in Cork, would have to be addressed as ChiefThese principled men were facing up to reality in calling for common sense and understanding in the consideration of what is a very complex question.The truth is that life and death issues are never black and white. Health and mental health issues are never straightforward either, as certain matters discussed in the Dáil demonstrated.A wrong decision, ordinary everyday living or just plain bad luck can lead to serious outcomes for a man’s health or mental health, ruining his life. Or worse.Should the State have the right to come along, and, without logic, compassion or exception, automatically punish him for this?Well done to those independents – the Healy-Rea brothers, Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins among them, along with Fianna Fáil TDs who later posed with colleagues for a Retain the Eighth photo, for taking a principled stand.Particularly men in rural areas who do not have proper access to public transport and are forced to travel alone or with a pal to access a public house and then risk arrest if they inadvertently drive home unintentionally buckled.This cannot go on.“Why aren’t all men on the pilsner anyway?” is what female TDs understandably ask, because they know what’s right for a man.“If a boy gets himself into trouble, can he not take the morning-after pilsner?”Women think there are better options for men, so we asked one.“The media refuses to talk about the great joy that non-alcoholic pilsners can bring to tipsy men who might otherwise get their penis pierced or hang around vasectomy mills, with no thought to the precious fruit of their loins. It was proved somewhere in America that vasectomies cause testicular cancer and homicidal thoughts and genital piercings make men go mad in the head,” said Iona Yewtris, spokeswoman for the high-profile BarristersAndConsultants4CatholicLobbyGroups group, which graciously represents the condescending wing of its mother organisation Defoul (Defending the Fruit of Our Loins).Unfortunately, the non-alcoholic pilsner is not suitable for every man.So sometimes, despite taking every precaution, including self-administered spritzers, there can be consequences.Obviously, if men are having vasectomies and sleeping around and then getting into their cars after popping multiple pilsners, the State should take their vehicles away and reserve the right to jail them for 14 years. It’s what the Road Traffic (amendment) Bill is all about.Otherwise, there must be compassion and common sense.The drink and the driver?Love them both.Kevin O’Keeffe, Fianna Fáil TD for Cork East, was among the deputies arguing passionately against the proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Bill which would see automatic driving bans imposed on first time drink-driving offenders with a blood alcohol level of above 50 milligrams100 millilitres.Currently, first-time offenders receive a fine and penalty points.“Drunk-driving or excessive drink-driving, I do not condone it,” stressed Kevin, but the proposed measures would be “taking the heart out of rural Ireland”.He then proceeded, not to mansplain, but to GAHsplain for the benefit of a rather baffled looking Shane Ross, aka Winston Churchtown.“I’ll put it in simple man terms, Minister, what you are doing at the moment, seeing as you’re Minister for Sport as well. We have a sport: GAA. Up to recently, there was the red card and the yellow card. Red card – you’re gone. Take that as taking the irresponsible drinking driver off the road.“Yellow card, which we are taking about at the moment, will give you a second chance. What you are trying to do here, Minister, is bring in a black card, but in GAA, and in the playing field, you get another player. You get an alternative – in other words, you have a substitute. But here you provide no alternative for an innocent person that inadvertently might be over the limit, for example, in the morning,” he informed the nonplussed minister.“You have provided no alternative for transport, be it bus, taxi drivers or a second driver. That is the big issue here, Minister, that you are just trying to turn a yellow card into a black card without any proper consideration for the damage you are going to cause.”O’Keefe mentioned the effect a driving ban might have on people. Did the Minster think about people’s careers and the knock-on effect?“I hope that those who lose their jobs in such situations do not go further beyond the mental health problem – I say as much sincerely.”He then went from the GAA to international affairs.“When people like us were speaking that the legislation not be changed, you came out with some of your pressure groups and threw it upon the people that they were the causes of killing people, which is incorrect. You were on about drunk drivers – those category of people – which is unfair.“What I’ll say to you, Minister: If a Palestinian throws a little scud over the border into Israel, you and your cohorts come back like the Israelis with bombers. Bombers! That’s what you came back to us like. In other words, no proper balanced argument on the issue.“ And that’s why, Minister, I am speaking tonight.”Children’s Rights campaigners expressed relief on Wednesday when an Oireachtas committee rejected proposals to raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age.Chief executive of the Children’s Rights Alliance Tanya Ward said the groups were “pleased that common sense has prevailed”.But it was a very close-run thing.Before the meeting, there were very strong indications in Leinster House from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin that the parties would not accept the amendment, despite having previously agreed to it.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan didn’t look too confident at the beginning of the meeting, when Fianna Fáil sought to raise the age limit as expected.This was despite their representative, justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan, indicating at an earlier committee his support for the Bill following a thorough briefing on the issue by numerous experts in the field, including Special Rapporteur on Child Protection Dr Geoffrey Shannon.Sinn Féin representative and the committee chairman Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin also approved the Bill.At the outset, Charlie Flanagan made a point of acknowledging their work and reminded Ó Caoláin that the committee he chaired stated the Bill would “provide particular protection to children” was therefore setting the age of consent at 13 “allowing for a review at a later date”.Thus informed, the Sinn Féin TD duly stuck with his original decision. Before the Minister could get to him, O’Callaghan jumped in.“I’m sure people will say ‘you were part of the committee that set the age of consent at 13’,” he began defensively, explaining that when he is at a meeting, he is not “running to the fourth floor to see what the Fianna Fáil stance on this issue is”.However, he said the front bench had since had “a thorough discussion” and he would now be pushing for the age to be changed to 16.So while senior counsel Jim was convinced enough by the expert evidence given to him at committee to vote for the lower age, it cut no ice with his front bench colleagues who were not present.Maybe the fourth floor should give Jim a walkie-talkie so he can take instructions on what way to vote in real time at committees. That way, he wouldn’t even have to bother listening to the expert evidence and making informed decisions on the back of it.Flanagan won the day and the proposal was lost.  Captain’s Day put in the shade by Kenyan ‘tribal leader’ O’Flynn The captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, Fianna Fail’s Robert Troy, hosted a very successful Captain’s Day at his home course in Mullingar last weekend.There wasn’t a huge turnout of serving parliamentarians, with most of the players retired TDs and Senators. Guests of honour for the day were the EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan and former commissioner for the internal market, Charlie McCreevy. And what an honour it was for everyone – we hear the two distinguished gentlemen gave up a day’s racing at Punchestown to grace the midlands with their presence.Also playing were former tánaiste and Labour leader Dick Spring, who brought along a brace of bottles of Dingle whiskey which was gratefully received by two members of the officer board – Galway independent TD Noel Grealish and former labour TD Jack Wall, the society’s PRO whose job it is to tell journalists nothing.There was one woman player – former Labour TD Lorraine Higgins, who is now with Retail Excellence Ireland. The society is conspicuously devoid of female members.Winston Churchill, aka Shane Ross the Minister for Sport, was not in attendance. He was at their last big day, which was the President’s Prize in Wicklow, but ended up insulting Troy, his FF nemesis in Transport in the course of his speech. Funnily enough, he never got an invitation for Robert Troy’s Captain’s Day outing.The Australian ambassador, Richard Andrews, came along to play a round. He presented the two former commissioners with a bottle each of very special Australian wine which you’d be hard pressed to find in any shops in Europe. Although that could change if the EU and Australia could see their way to striking a nice trade deal in the future, he quipped, with an eye on the current commissioner.Two local players, Ann-Marie Conlon and her husband Peadar, won the women’s and men’s long drive competition. President and self-styled “international secretary” Donie Cassidy won the long speech competition in the clubhouse.The winner of the Captain’s Prize was retired Circuit Court judge and Workers PartyDemocratic Left TD back in Old God’s time Pat McCartan. He gets his name on the silver perpetual cup, which dates back to 1927. He can keep it at home for a year or leave it for display and safekeeping in the members’ bar in Leinster House, where it usually lives. Runner-up was former FF TD Tom Kitt while Barry Cowen, the party’s spokesman on public expenditure, was third. Former cathaoirleach of the Seanad Paddy Burke just missed out on glory.Hogan and McCreevy were presented with commemorative scrolls and honorary life membership of the society. This means they don’t have to pay their annual subs of €25 any more, which will be a great help to them as they only have a few fat pensions to fall back on.In years gone by, the day would have been sponsored by the likes of a drinks company or a big bank. This year it was sponsored by The Newbrook Group, which runs nursing homes.We don’t know if former FF TD for Cork North Central Noel O’Flynn ever tees- off with the Oireachtas society. But he couldn’t have attended last week anyway, because he was apparently in Kenya.O’Flynn was a TD for 14 years before stepping down at the 2011 election. His former colleagues were fascinated to read on Facebook yesterday that he has been made an honorary tribal chief in Kenya, which rather puts Hogan and McCreevy in the shade.Judging by the photo posted by Cork businessman and family friend Michael Mulcahy, O’Flynn looks like he could do with a bit of shade.Mulcahy posted that Noel “was honoured by being appointed a tribe leader in Kenya last week in recognition of his support of businesses in Kenya. Appointment as an honorary tribe leader is one of the greatest honours in Kenya.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485769.1525522987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nasa begins first ever exploration of mars interior","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnited Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas-V rocket with the Nasa InSight spacecraft onboard seen shortly after the mobile service tower was rolled back. Photograph: Bill IngallsNasaReutersNasa has launched a spacecraft to land on Mars and explore the mysterious insides of the red planet.A robotic geologist armed with a hammer and quake monitor is rocketing towards Mars after the successful launch of the craft on Saturday.In a twist, Nasa launched the Mars InSight lander from California rather than Florida’s Cape Canaveral.It was the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the US west coast, drawing pre-dawn crowds to Vandenberg Air Force Base and rocket watchers down the California coast into Baja.The spacecraft will take more than six months to get to Mars and start its unprecedented geological excavations, travelling 482 million km (300m miles) to get there.InSight will dig deeper into Mars than ever before — nearly 16 feet — to take the planet’s temperature.It will also attempt to make the first measurements of ‘Marsquakes’, using a high-tech seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface.Also aboard the Atlas V rocket: A pair of mini-satellites, or CubeSats, meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration.The one billion dollar mission involves scientists from the US, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe.“I can’t describe to you in words how very excited I am . . . to go off to Mars,” said project manager Tom Hoffman from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “It’s going to be awesome.”Nasa has not put a spacecraft down on Mars since the Curiosity rover in 2012.The US is the only country to successfully land and operate a spacecraft at Mars. Only about 40 per cent of all missions to Mars from all countries — orbiters and landers alike — have proven successful over the decades.If all goes well, the three-legged InSight will descend by parachute and engine firings onto a flat equatorial region of Mars — believed to be free of big, potentially dangerous rocks — on November 26th.Once down, it will stay put, using a mechanical arm to place the science instruments on the surface.InSight’s chief scientist, Bruce Banerdt of JPL, said Mars is ideal for learning how the rocky planets of our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Unlike our active Earth, Mars has not been transformed by plate tectonics and other processes, he noted.Over the course of two Earth years — or one Martian year — scientists expect InSight’s three main experiments to provide a true 3-D image of Mars.The lander is equipped with a seismometer for measuring Marsquakes, a self-hammering probe for burrowing beneath the surface, and a radio system for tracking the spacecraft’s position and planet’s wobbly rotation, thereby revealing the size and composition of Mars’ core. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/04/TELEMMGLPICT000159624385_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQpeGv_xTcGu9U5p8psk4dVEuO4fPjmUHE8hJTGDhcYg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"meghan markle found wedding florist google","story":"Meghan Markle will fill the chapel with roses, foxgloves and peoniesIt is one of the most important decisions a bride has to make: who to trust with the crucial bouquet and flower arrangements.It might be assumed that a Royal bride, who will have the eyes of the world upon her, would have the industry’s finest florists on speed dial personal appointments made with the most sought after in high society.Not so, it seems. For Meghan Markle, 36, found her chosen flower arranger just like every other bride: on Google.The 36-year-old told Philippa Craddock, the “floral mastermind” who will be responsible for lining the aisles of St George’s Chapel with fragrant blooms and designing the bridal bouquet, that she had found her on the internet.Rather than take advantage of her enviable connections, Ms Markle was apparently curled up on the sofa at Nottingham Cottage, the pied-a-terre she shares with Prince Harry in the grounds of Kensington Palace, browsing endless web pages and searching for that one person who would share her vision of the big day.Despite being the preferred supplier for public and private events hosted by Kensington Palace, Craddock was said to have been stunned when she was contacted by a representative for the royals and informed she had been chosen.Meghan Markle chose Philippa Craddock to create the floral displays for her wedding Her team will spend several days ahead of May 19 transforming St George’s Chapel and St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor, filling them with springtime whites and pastels in an incredibly dramatic yet romantic display.They are using locally sourced seasonal foliage and an abundance of white garden roses and foxgloves as well as Ms Markle’s favourite peonies.It is understood that Craddock will be personally responsible for the bride’s bouquet and will hand it to her on the day, shortly before she embarks on the short journey with her mother, Doria, from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car.Ms Markle is likely to have been swayed by Craddock’s partnership with a Briton-based charity committed to alleviating the World Water Crisis and which is raising money to fund a well that will provide a whole community with clean drinking water. The soon-to-be royal bride has  travelled to Rwanda with World Vision to campaign on the same issue.Meghan Markle will travel to the wedding ceremony with her mother, DoriaFormer clients have praised Craddock’s “meticulous attention to detail” and she is understood to have been carefully overseeing every element of the royal wedding project.Ms Markle too, has been “very hands on”.

Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

After we’ve gotten many, many Marsquakes from different directions, we can put together a three dimensional view of the inside of Mars.”The rocket carrying the Insight mission — Atlantis — will occur at 4.05am Pacific time Saturday, or 11.05am GMT. A forecast for fog may force a delay of the launch, however.Nasa has attempted to send seismometers to Mars previously, in the 1970s, but the missions failed because the sensors were positioned on the body of the probes and were therefore unable to detect ground vibrations.Scientists are not sure how many quakes they will be able to detect over the course of the year, but their estimates indicate they may see as many as a couple dozen.Nasa finds flowing water on Mars - in picturesNasa finds flowing water on Mars - in picturesPortions of the Martian surface shot by NASA\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show many channels from 1 meter to 10 meters wide on a scarp in the Hellas impact basinAn area on the surface of Mars, approximately 1.5 by three kilometers in size, displaying frosted gullies on a south-facing slope within a craterThis is the first time that free-flowing water has been directly confirmed on Mars100 meter-long streaks called recurring slope lineae flowing downhill on Mars, inferred to have been formed by contemporary flowing waterFile handout image of the Phoenix Mars LanderThey expect the quakes to be small — at around a Magnitude 3. That size of quake could be slept through by a person on earth.Nasa expects Mars to have a metal core, a dense mantle, and a ligher crust, but they are not sure precisely where the boundaries of these layers will be found.The seismometers are an international collaboration in a way, with the French providing broadband sensors that detect low-frequency vibrations on the ground, while the UK has provided a trio of micro seismometers, which will detect higher frequencies.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

It must be removed now.”Lucy Jones, of Doctors of the World, which works closely with undocumented migrants, said: “We regularly see patients, often in urgent need of medical care, who are too afraid to go to NHS services fearing their information will be shared across government. The exemption makes this fear an absolute reality.”And Adrian Berry, chairman of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, highlighted how lawyers for migrants would no longer be able to obtain their files using “subject access requests”.“The impact the exemption will have on curtailing access to personal data therefore goes to the very heart of access to justice and the preservation of the rule of law,” he warned.Amnesty, the Refugee Council, the National Aids Trust, the National Education Union, Privacy International and the trade union Unison are among the other organisations which have signed the letter, sent to Sajid Javid, the new home secretary.The Independent revealed last October that the exemption in the data protection bill would remove data privacy rights for immigration investigations.May should let parliament decide what to do about the customs unionVince Cable: ‘Theresa May will fight the next election’Theresa May ‘vetoed plan for overseas doctors to fill NHS gaps’Tory rebels vow to force May to reveal ‘tainted money’ in tax havensNew home sec says May’s ‘hostile’ immigration rhetoric not BritishHowever, the controversy has grown in the wake of the Windrush scandal – prompting the crucial amendment, put down by Labour and the Lib Dems, to be debated on Wednesday.The prime minister was accused of being in denial about the issue, when she told MPs recently: “It will be possible for people to access the information that they need.”In reality, the bill clearly states the rights to personal data “do not apply” where that conflicts with “the maintenance of effective immigration control” or “the investigation” of suspected immigration offences.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, told The Independent: “This is completely against the British traditions of justice and the rule of law. It is an odious proposal.“If Theresa May doesn’t change her mind on this, no one will be able to take seriously a word she has said since Windrush. This is the first test.”The Home Office made “a lot of mistakes”, Mr Davey said – sometimes trying to deport “completely the wrong person” – which were only thwarted by the right to open up files.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said the policy was a “continuation of the government’s hostile environment policy”, adding: “Given the government’s track record in this area there no guarantee that it would exercise any exemption properly or proportionately.“Labour will support measures to delete this exemption from the bill when it returns to the Commons next week.”The Home Office has insisted the right to request data “will be met in all cases except where to do so could undermine our immigration control”.A spokesperson said: “They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.”However, lawyers have rejected that right to appeal, warning a person would probably have been deported before a ruling came through.After his appointment last week, Mr Javid dropped the use of the “hostile environment” phrase – favoured by the prime minister – but has yet to say he will change the policies behind it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at an event to mark  Karl Marx’s 200th birthday at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander\u0027s robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one-half the radius of a hydrogen atom.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes over the course of the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet\u0027s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it and the outermost layer, the crust.The Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well, detecting thousands of moonquakes and meteorite impacts. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.A STUNNING phenomenon occurred in the atmosphere over Antarctica                    NASA1 of 10\u0027Meteor smoke’ gathers in the sky above the South PoleInsight also will be fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.Meanwhile, a special transmitter on the lander will send radio signals back to Earth, tracking Mars\u0027 subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet\u0027s core and possibly whether it remains molten.Hitching a ride aboard the same rocket that launches InSight will be a pair of miniature satellites called CubeSats, which will fly to Mars on their own paths behind the lander in a first deep-space test of that technology.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/590x/NASA-InSight-launch-time-955580.jpg","title":"NASA InSight launch time Mars Nasa launch watch live stream TODAY","story":"NASA InSight launch time: The launch will take place todayThe powerful Atlas 5 rocket is poised for liftoff this morning at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.Atlas 5 will be carrying the first robotic NASA lander to Mars and is designed entirely for exploring the deep interior of the red planet.The Mars InSight probe is due to blast off from the central California coast, creating a luminous predawn spectacle of the first U.S. interplanetary spacecraft to be launched over the Pacific.The payload will be released about 90 minutes after launch on a 301 million-mile (484 million km) flight to Mars.The mission is due to reach its destination in six months, landing on a broad, smooth plain close to the planet\u0027s equator called the Elysium Planitia - and putting InSight roughly 373 miles from the 2012 landing site of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity.

Peter Bone uses BRILLIANT analogy to point out EU exit bill ABSURDITY                Brexit news: What is the customs union? How would EU partnership work?The research, by Rob Ford and Maria Sobolewska, admitted predicting exactly how the electorate will look in the future is impossible.And they acknowledged their forecasts \u0026ldquomake the unrealistic assumption that nothing else will change.But they said their study did serve to show \u0026ldquothe Brexit majority is fragile and on the wrong side of powerful demographic pressures.By projecting \u0026ldquorobust and well established demographic trends, the two academics from the University of Manchester predicted there could be enough support to overturn the Brexit vote, if another were held, by the end of the transition period.Changes in the UK\u0027s population is likely to lead to the electorate becoming more pro-RemainThe pair identified three key factors which they said are likely to give rise to a Remain majority - an increasing education level, more ethnic ersity and \u0026ldquogenerational change.The study cites data collected by the National Centre for Social Research which found people most likely to have voted Leave were those who either left school after their CSEs or O-levels, or had no formal education or qualifications.Professor Ford and Dr Sobolewska used this data, along with figures which show more and more young people are attending university, to estimate changes in education alone would result in two percent less support for Brexit by 2021.By 2026, they projected it would result in four percent fewer Leave voters.Rising education levels will tend to pull the electorate towards a pro-EU majority, the study saidThe pair also determined changes in the attitudes of voters would likely result in a change to the Brexit vote.Those who were of voting age before Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973 were much more likely to vote for Brexit, the academics found.They said: \u0026ldquoWhile voters\u0026rsquo attitudes can change as they age, there is a lot of evidence that the different conditions prevalent when generations come of age have a lasting impact on their values, and that younger cohorts generally have more socially liberal and cosmopolitan outlooks.\u0026ldquoGenerational replacement is therefore likely to slowly pull attitudes in a more liberal direction, with older, more socially conservative cohorts who came of age before Britain joined the EU slowly fading away, while new socially liberal and cosmopolitan young voters, who have no memory of a Britain outside of the EU, join the electorate.The electorate of 2021 will be made up of fewer people who were of voting age in the pre-EEC daysTheir study, for the think-tank UK in a Changing Europe, projected that by 2021, generational change will have resulted in two percent less support for Brexit, and three percent less by 2026.However, Professor Ford and Dr Sobolewska also found that despite the predicted demographic shift towards a Remain-backing majority, the changes might not necessarily be enough for the Brexit vote to be overturned if another referendum was held.They said: \u0026ldquoBrexit has also changed views about the status quo \u0026ndash many of those who backed Remain believe the result of the referendum should be respected and would not support a complete reversal of the Brexit process.\u0026ldquoMany in the rising europhile demographic groups would instead prefer to see Britain outside the EU but closely aligned with it.\u0026ldquoWhile \u0026lsquohard\u0026rsquo Brexiteers look to be on the wrong side of demographic trends, a softer form of Brexit could \u0026ndash all else being equal \u0026ndash enjoy broader and more sustainable support in the long run."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/364704.jpg","title":"local elections 2018 Owen Jones Andrew Neil Labour Party news","story":"Mr Jones visited four London boroughs yesterday as part of his campaign, all of which were key Labour targets.However, Kensington, Westminster and Wandsworth were all held by the Tories, while Theresa May\u0027s party actually won in Barnet, taking the council from no overall control.Journalist Andrew Neil tweeted \u0026ldquothis made me chuckle to a Spectator article which highlighted the Owen Jones effect at the local elections.The article reads: \u0026ldquo columnist has been taking his campaign to key Labour target seats.\u0026bullTWITTEROwen Jones visited four boroughs on Saturday -

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.In Birmingham, a traditionally Labour-dominated city, the Tories did better than expected, prompting suggestions they could take control, but Labour ended up hanging on.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With all but a handful of councils declared, Labour had gained 64 wards and the Lib Dems 61, with the Tories losing 20 - and Ukip almost totally wiped out.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Kingston and Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield city region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403351203.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local elections 2018 results council declared full latest","story":"Two thirds of the results have already been announced, but the full picture wont be revealed until later today.

You have proven that my work is not yet finished.Thank you for the invitation, however, your offer is precisely the reason why I am campaigning in the first place. You have proven that my work is not yet finished.Im really sorry but I find this really insulting. Im not here to go on TV to find love.

There’s much more to come and it’s going to get even better.”But Labour women’s chair Jess Phillips said: “We have a problem getting trust in huge parts of the country outside our own echo chamber.”KEN Livingstone reignited the anti-Semitism row yesterday, claiming Zionists “collaborated” with Hitler, and insisting he will “go to his grave” saying so.He moaned on Sky News that coverage of his initial claims had been unfair.Labour suspended the ex-London Mayor, left, after his 2016 comments on an alleged Nazi deal.VINCE Cable claimed the Lib Dems were back after they won four councils in the best results for over a decade.The leader said the anti-Brexit party — written off a year ago — had “exceeded” expectations by taking seats from the Tories and Labour, and in Leave voting areas such as Hull and ­Sunderland.Overall the Lib Dems gained a net 66 seats across England, their best performance since gaining 123 in 2004.But experts warned that the party was benefiting from the fact it did so badly in 2014, the last time this year’s council election seats were contested.THE head of Ukip compared his party to the Black Death as he insisted they’d survive a council election wipeout.Despite losing 120 seats the anti-EU party will return, said general secretary Paul Oakley.He told the BBC: “It’s not all over at all. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages, it comes along, it causes disruption and then it goes dormant.“That’s exactly what we’re go­ing to do.”Reminded the Black Death killed tens of millions in the 14th century, Mr Oakley said it also led to economic growth.Ukip MEP Bill Etheridge said he’d quit politics next year, having lost his Dudley council seat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s crucial to the quality of our lives and our wellbeing.While we rest, our body repairs itself and builds proteins and hormones essential for us to use during the day.But how much sleep we need and the pattern of that sleep varies from person to person and changes throughout our lives.YOUR beautiful new baby is asleep more than they are awake.For the first two years of a child’s life, their brain and body are growing at a rapid rate – more than it will ever grow in the rest of their lifetime.A newborn baby needs to eat and sleep – this is what keeps them alive.Most wake every few hours to eat – and 95 per cent cry with a night awakening that will need a parental response.Tots spend most of their time in light sleep, known as REM.Their twitching bodies and jerky eye movements are a clear sign of this stage.A newborn’s sleep cycle is 40 minutes long and they wake regularly.This is an evolutionary function so that your baby can be roused easily to eat or be alert to danger.hours of sleep are lost each night in first year of being a parent – 3,330 hours by time kids turn threeAS your baby becomes older, they will begin to regulate their body rhythms and their busy little minds are learning so much about the world.Sleep is essential to an infant’s healthy development. They need sleep to absorb language, form attachments and learn behavioural cues.By this age, their sleeping patterns have changed and most sleep is happening at night.Night waking occurs among 50 per cent of children who previously slept through the night.Most sleep problems in children are temporary and do not have long-lasting side effects.By nine months, a baby’s sleep cycle has matured and your infant is able to sleep for longer periods.AFTER their first birthday, toddlers sleep for 11 to 14 hours. Their sleep cycle is still just 40 minutes but now they can self-soothe and go back to sleep on their own.They can cope with less sleep. Instead of having lots of broken periods, one-year-olds enjoy longer runs of deep sleep during the night.But with more independence, sleep problems such as anxiety arise. Toddlers can start to wake more often in the night, aware they are alone in the dark in a big bed – and some will feel afraid.Parents need to respond carefully. Nap strikes can occur as toddlers assert themselves, but if they don’t get enough sleep they won’t produce enough sleep-inducing hormones and could become sleep-deprived.Helping a child calm down before bed is key. Offer carbs and warm milk to encourage a good night’s rest.of us are unhappy with the amount of sleep we get each nightMOST children at this age will need about 12 hours’ sleep.As a child gets older, more slow-wave, non-rapid eye-movement sleep occurs earlier in the night, with an increase of REM later.During the day, a preschooler’s brain is worked constantly as they learn.You may find their little bodies will become tired more quickly and your child could start asking to go to bed earlier.Try to keep to your normal bedtime routine. Sleep problems with anxiety can occur as a child becomes more aware of risk and the dangers around them.Preschoolers are very visual and three-year-olds can start to experience night terrors as they begin to be exposed to more television programmes or books, causing worry.Night terrors typically show in the first few hours of sleep.of us manage to get between seven and eight hours of shut-eye a nightAS your child grows up, they need less sleep. But with their busy social life, exam revision and increasing homework, plus a drama or football class after school, they must not skip sleep.School-age kids who do can be irritable and have difficulty with memory, attention and reasoning.Research also shows that kids who don’t have a regular bedtime are more likely to have problems with hyper-activity and bonding with peers.Children are on the go 24/7, never switching off their computers, endlessly checking phones, in touch with a world that never sleeps. This is having devastating effects on sleep and wellbeing.Kids should not watch TV or use computers before bed as the bright light emitted suppresses production of melatonin – the major sleep hormone.YOUR teen’s brain is undergoing huge change during sleep – and they still need more kip than an adult.The chemical imbalances and changes that occur during adolescence are equivalent to having schizophrenia.Teens are impulsive and sometimes unable to think rationally or make wise decisions as their brain develops.They are useless at getting up in the morning, often feeling lethargic.This is down to a shift in their body clock which means sleep-inducing hormone melatonin will not be released until around 11pm, continuing until 8am.So your teen finds it hard to switch off until the midnight hours, and even harder to wake in time for school. This is why some schools are considering later start times for teens, to tackle sleep deprivation and improve education.of kids are more likely to become obese if they fail to get at least eight hours a nightWITH 69 per cent of kids under the age of ten affected by sleep problems, getting enough rest is the key to keeping children happy.Sammy Margo, author of The Good Sleep Guide For Kids, gives her top tips for helping your child get a good night’s rest.THINK PINK: Colours have a strong influence on our mood and feelings. While blues and purples can be calming, they can also be cold.Pinks will soothe and calm, and greens are thought to have a balancing and harmonious effect. The ideal colours to send your child off to sleep peacefully are pale shades of pink and green.KEEP IT DARK: We sleep better without light. Where possible, prevent natural light from peeking around the blinds or curtains.Some children may be afraid of the dark so using a green or yellow night light and something that doesn’t shine in your child’s eyes can help.BANISH SCREENS: Studies show that children who watch TV or play with tablets in their rooms get less sleep, with some even rising earlier in the morning to watch TV at the expense of sleep.We know that exposure to blue light interferes with the release of your sleepy hormone melatonin, so this can impact on the quality and quantity of your child’s sleep.Try setting a technology cut-off time and ensure that you limit their screen time.WEAR WOOL: Although expensive, wool is ideal for bed covers. Its heat-regulating qualities will keep your child warm in cold weather and cool in the heat.Children sleep better in a cooler room, so aim for around 16-18C. This can help everyone to get a better night’s rest and sleep for longer.FOOD FOR THOUGHT: To help your child feel ready for sleep, give them a bedtime snack. Porridge contains small amounts of melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep.Bananas contain melatonin and serotonin — another the sleep hormone — and muscle relaxant magnesium. Mash them with warm milk and a little honey for a super-sleep combination.EXERCISE IS KEY: Every child should have 60 active minutes of exercise a day. Divide the time into 15-minute slots throughout the day.Exercise in the daylight will help your child feel tired at bedtime and sleep well through the night. The combination of exercise and daylight works to regulate the body’s sleep/wake cycle.ROUTINE AT THE READY: A bedtime ritual can be hugely effective in making sure your child sleeps well every night.Children love rhythm and routine. Set aside time for a simple bedtime routine such as a warm, relaxing bath, followed by a bedtime story and a sleep-inducing glass of warm milk.Then dim the lights and watch as your child glides off into the Land of Nod.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s very important to her that both her parents have roles in her wedding.”Speculation had mounted for months over whether dad Thomas would attend on May 19.But as The Sun revealed last month it was always  his intention to be at his daughter’s side.He has now been measured up for his Royal Wedding suit by his local tailor in Rosarito, Mexico. He spent 15 minutes inside the small backstreet wedding and tuxedo shop — a short drive from his ocean-side home.Thomas was casually dressed in black trousers and a dark navy polo shirt, with a pair of glasses hooked on the front.A young shop worker was seen measuring his arm, neck, waist and legs with a roll of white tape. Sources said it is likely his measurements will be sent on to a top tailors in London.One source said “He was all smiles at the local tailors.“Thomas was just getting measured in preparation for his wedding suit. That store is the only one close to where he lives.” A spokesman for the Mexican  tailors refused to comment. Prince Harry, 33, is still to meet  his future  father-in-law who US actress Meghan is said to “adore”.They will get together for the first time in the days before the wedding. The source added: “Thomas cannot wait to fly to the UK to see Meghan and meet Prince Harry for the first time. He will be extremely nervous, but his family are backing him.“Despite some of the squabbles in the family, he is the one who joins them all together. He still has the respect of virtually everyone.”Thomas married yoga instructor Doria  in 1979. They divorced in 1988 and he now lives alone.It was also revealed yesterday that Meghan and Harry will follow tradition and spend the night before their wedding apart. Meghan will stay with her social worker mum at a secret location.She is only having children as her bridesmaids and page boys — including Princess Charlotte, three, and Prince George, four.She won’t have a Maid of Honour or chief bridesmaid.  A spokesman said: “She has a very close group of friends and didn’t want to choose one over the other.”It emerged that Kate will be at the wedding but new baby Prince Louis won’t. Prince Harry also wanted to remember his late mum Princess Diana  on the big day.So all three of her three siblings Earl Spencer, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale will be present with their families — and Lady Jane will give a reading.Harry and Meghan will live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OUR ten-year-old daughter just cannot sleep. She reads and reads, often until 11pm. We have tried asking her to switch off the light but she just wriggles around, making sure we are aware that she is still awake.She’s terrible in the mornings and we are sure she would be a happier person with more sleep but we have no idea how to make that happen. What should we do?A. As parents you are the best people to help your child learn to sleep independently. However, at times you may feel exhausted, stressed and worried about the amount of sleep your child may or may not be getting.Create a bedtime box that you make with your child. Put all the things she will need to feel safe at night into the box and do this every bedtime – maybe something soft to touch, pictures of you and safe books about sleep.Instruct her to go through these items at bedtime as a signpost toward sleep, helping to distract her from negative thoughts and feelings.The foundation of relaxing and habitualising her to her room and bed should be done by helping her feel that she is part of the process.Q. I HAVE just moved my 20-month-old toddler from a cot to a bed and he now ends up in my bed every night. What can I do to break this habit?A. Place different things under his pillow at night so he is excited about going to bed. Change the item on a daily basis.The idea is to create curiosity and surprise, encouraging a positive association with bedtime. Ground children in sight, sound, touch and smell, and use things they can see, hear, feel and smell to make them feel safe.Get your child used to his bed both day and night. The more time your child spends there, the more he will accept it. Do not leave him to cry unattended for a long period, as this will create a negative association, and try to not take him into your bed. Instead, lie next to him so he feels safe.Do this for each wake. It should take about two weeks to resolve.Q. MY daughter is 11 and struggles to get to sleep. She goes to bed at around 9pm and has to be up for school by 6.45am. But she becomes anxious about not being able to sleep.I tell her to read until she’s sleepy – or failing that, turn the lights out and listen to an audiobook. I don’t allow screens for an hour before bedtime, but other than that I’m clueless. How much sleep does she actually need?A. We hear a lot about getting your child into a good routine being essential for good sleep. But the interesting thing here is that routines are NOT the Holy Grail to sleep. Routine is just a small part of your sleep plan at night.Yes, a routine may be the only thing you need to do to help some babes sleep. But in my years of experience, it’s usually more than that.One key factor that most people miss is the environment. To get your child to sleep, you must ensure their bedroom is conducive to sleep. Would you sleep here? Help your child feel safe at night by ensuring their room isn’t too dark. Anxious children do not sleep. If it is too dark, then they will wake and call out for us. Also, do make sure they are not too cold or too hot.Most importantly, get her to write her worries in a worry book and place pictures of you around their room so she feels safe when you are not there.ASSESS: Analyse what’s happening, what you need to do and what your child’s needs are.UNDERSTAND: What is your child trying to communicate?SOOTH: Comfort your child appropriatelyEXIT: Leave the room and allow your child to sleep.Q. MY five-year-old wakes very early in the morning, about 5.30am, and it’s hard to convince him to go back to sleep. I can’t put him to bed later because he’s exhausted after school and begging to go to bed by 7pm. What can I do?A. Children are supposed to wake during the night and rise early but this is not ideal for us.Sleeping like a baby does not mean deep sleep. In fact, children are naturally light sleepers.They have more periods of light sleep than adults and these periods last longer.To combat early rising, you need to charm your child back to sleep. First think about your mental state. Are you calm and relaxed? A child can quickly pick up on your mood – if you are feeling stressed, so is your child.Focus on your breathing, by taking one breath at a time. This will slow your heart rate and relax any tension in your body. When you have focused on your breathing for two minutes, pick your child up, hold them close and breathe deeply in their ear steadily and rhythmically.The thought “my child will never sleep” is usually what most of my parents say crosses their mind – and when it does, it leads them to do all kinds of undesirable things, such as driving their child across town in order to allow sleep to happen, or rocking or feeding to sleep.These actions will not help your child to sleep independently. So by changing the way you think and having more helpful thoughts, you are more likely to act in a way that helps your child to sleep.Q. MY three-year-old daughter has just started having terrible nightmares. She wakes in the night and cries out for me and it takes her a very long time to calm down.What can I do to reassure her?A. Practise mindfulness. Sleep issues such as night terrors can make parents very anxious.At night, you want to be able to comfort your child in a way that means they are not dependent on you and also gets them back off to sleep.I use the “pause” method, which is popular in France and matches your response to the level of distress your child is in. It involves watching them for a few minutes to see if they go back to sleep, rather than rushing in and picking them up.GETTING your baby or tot to sleep, and stay asleep, is no easy feat.So here are some of the best aids to help exhausted parents . . .BEST FOR CUDDLING . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down. She must then challenge the EU to get serious about solving the Irish border issue.Millions of Tory votes count on it.The party has a right to celebrate its election victories and improved  campaigning team. But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one. The Government must make the case for capitalism over socialism and give younger voters a real stake in it. A huge increase in affordable homes is vital.The Tories cannot survive on Brexit alone.AT long last voters have given Corbyn’s toxic party the bloody nose it deserves.Its rampant anti-Semitism killed it in Barnet. Maybe lefties’ racist barracking of new Home Secretary Sajid Javid online cost Labour elsewhere. Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted. Especially not while it supports staying in a customs union.WHY did it take so long to reprieve brave Afghan interpreters from deportation and let them stay here without paying a penny?It was blatantly unfair on people who  served our country. Yet a simple decision took months. Why? Sajid Javid sorted it days after arriving at the Home Office.The Tories are too slow to right  obvious wrongs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are significant mysteries here, because while both Mars and the Earth were formed from the same stuff more than 4.5 billion years ago, they are now very different planets. NASA\u0027s scientists have seen a lot of evidence that Mars has quakes - known as marsquakes. Unlike Earth, where quakes are caused by tectonic plates, Mars has very quiet tectonic processes.This means marsquakes are more likely to be caused by other forms of tectonic activity, including volcanism and cracks forming in the planet\u0027s crust.NASA said: \"Each marsquake would be like a flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet\u0027s interior.Earth and Venus have tectonic systems which have destroyed most evidence of their early history, but Mars (which is just one third the size of those planets), contains less energy to power these tectonic processes.NASA said this makes Mars a fossil planet in many ways because it has remained static for more than three billion years.The mission launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
