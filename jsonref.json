It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil’s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management,” the letter added.The C of E holds a small stake in Exxon, worth about £7m compared to the oil company’s market value of more than $183bn (£146bn). However, the Church Commissioners have proven to be influential shareholders regardless of their size.The Church Commissioners have again filed a resolution calling for the chief executive and chairman roles – held by Darren Woods – to be separated.But Exxon is again at odds with the Church Commissioners voting plans. The oil giant is recommending that investors vote in favour of re-electing all of its board members, but is recommending they reject the shareholder resolutions, including the lobbying report.A  investigation last year found that Exxon had spent €37.2m (£32.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010, according to data released though the EU’s transparency register. That is more than other major oil companies including shell and BP, which spent €36.5m and €18.1m respectively on lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy.It also recently emerged that ExxonMobil met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to a climate lobbying watchdog.ExxonMobil was not immediately available for comment, but in a document released ahead of its AGM said that its position on key issues and lobbying were publicly available on its website and that it followed all applicable disclosure laws.The company also defended the board’s approach to the climate crisis, saying it “routinely reviews environmental stewardship and discusses issues related to the company’s business, including the risks related to climate change”.ExxonMobil has rejected calls for an independent chairman, saying that the rest of the board was already made up of independent directors and that the change would not improve oversight or be in shareholders’ best interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d84b094994ec2a0d6d16c1b00a1ade20a90b183/0_188_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfc39857e8c765ba6c5324e3360dfc0","title":"uk housebuilder persimmon joins sector return to site work","story":"Government backs lockdown return with construction workers under strict safety rules, says companyThe UK’s second-biggest housebuilder has announced that workers will return to building sites on Monday in the latest sign that the UK economy is reopening after weeks of lockdown.Persimmon said it would restart work on 27 April, a month after it felt compelled to shut its sites because of the government’s pandemic restrictions.The FTSE 100 housebuilder, which sold more than 16,000 homes last year, is the latest in a stream of major companies to reveal plans to reopen this week with new safety protocols. Persimmon’s rivals Taylor Wimpey and Vistry, formerly known as Bovis, both announced plans on Thursday to start building again. Vistry said it would resume building homes on Monday, while the first Taylor Wimpey workers will return on 4 May.Beyond housebuilders, DIY retailer B\u0026ampQ reopened 155 stores this week. Some of the largest factories in the UK car industry also plan to reopen their gates, including those owned by Vauxhall, Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Bentley.Dave Jenkinson, Persimmon’s outgoing chief executive, said the construction industry had government backing for the return to work, and said workers could be removed from sites if they do not adhere to social distancing guidelines.On Friday, the government’s housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, urged more housebuilders to return to work, in an interview with Building magazine. The Conservative government, under pressure from its own backbench MPs, is keen to allow the economy to restart.Jenrick said: “I welcome developers reopening sites following careful consideration of public-health guidance. Building the homes the country needs is vitally important. Work in construction can and should continue.”The lack of explicit guidance for housebuilders and other sectors had caused confusion, with many firms unwilling to take the reputational risk of asking staff to return to work even if there were no legal impediment. Housebuilders in particular have faced protests from concerned workers.Jenkinson said: “Having spent the last month developing and testing new site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures, we believe that we are now able to return to site safely and support the UK’s economic recovery from the pandemic.“These new measures are fully compliant with government public health guidance and will be strictly enforced by a specialist team, with any inidual failing to uphold standards being subject to disciplinary action and removal from site.”Construction work has continued in some “limited instances” since the lockdown started, Persimmon added.The company, which has previously been at the heart of controversies over executive pay, including a £75m bonus payment to its former chief executive, has not used the government’s furlough scheme and has covered the wages of employees unable to work. The company, which has also been a major recipient of the government help-to-buy subsidy, added it has no plans to access government funding during the crisis and “continues to pay all taxes promptly”.Cancellations of house purchases are still at “historically low levels”, Persimmon said, suggesting that the effects of a looming UK recession had not yet been felt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7fd339aad290b131a48a4b1c565afcda4335700/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=221288b7e2a84ed1bb1bd9701c585709","title":"uk treasury mulling government backed loans smallest firms","story":"Proposal follows slow take-up of bank lending by companies during Covid-19 crisis The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is believed to be close to making a decision about adapting the current scheme, which has come under criticism in the last week from business lobby groups, former chancellors and the governor of the Bank of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff8c576f8137ae93f0cb4fa07eda2b4ef623e0ae/0_292_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a8c83c17c535ad69dc80adffb057cbc","title":"face masks mandatory spread coronavirus government","story":"The government’s objections to this seemingly effective measure appear more political and economic than scientificThree months on, even as more than 30 countries, including Germany, have mandated face coverings outdoors for the public, the UK government has been adamant that there’s not enough evidence to support such a move here. The government, advised by the scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage), is expected to make a decision shortly on whether face masks will be mandatory. Reports suggest that the advice will be a compromise, with the public allowed to choose to wear scarves or face-coverings rather than medical-grade masks. So why has there been such a ergence on this issue?Most of us would probably ask how well a mask, especially a one made from cloth, may protect us from Covid-19. But the notion of “personal protection” misses the major reason why calls for increased use of masks and face-coverings have gained momentum around the world. From February, data was emerging that, unlike Sars – where patients were most contagious several days after showing severe symptoms – people infected by Sars-Cov-2, the cause of Covid-19, were “shedding” most viruses (that could infect someone else) just before or at the time symptoms first appeared, often in very mild form. This had two implications: first, efforts to “contain” coronavirus would be orders of magnitude more difficult than for Sars. Second, and as it has turned out more contentiously, the official World Health Organization and UK government advice that masks should only be worn by members of the public showing symptoms, and members of their immediate households, is probably wrong.So what are the objections that have been raised against masks in public as policy? There have been repeated statements that the evidence in favour of masks is flimsy and ambiguous. For medics, the “gold standard” of evidence is the randomised controlled trial (some people take the medicine or undergo the intervention, and some don’t, and we look to see if there were benefits or risks). There have been a few trials looking at masks for preventing influenza, and results were disappointing – although crucially, most of the group meant to wear masks actually didn’t: it turns out we’re just not that scared of catching the flu.But if one looks at the same level of evidence for the other measures strongly advocated by the government, for example hand-washing, studies have been similarly disappointing. And for other advice, such as the two-metre rule, or lockdowns, there have been no trials at all. So masks seem subject to a different standard of evidence than other measures. And while controlled trial data is not available, “natural experiments” do suggest at least a correlation between mask-wearing and reduced Covid-19 transmission. The city of Jena in Germany introduced mandatory mask-wearing on 31 March and recorded no new infections for eight days, while surrounding cities continued to see a rise.That perhaps leaves the final objection, which is that the public wearing masks will ert this scarce resource away from hospitals and care homes. In this sense, the government may simply be dragging its feet because of scarcity – which is a political and economic issue, not a scientific one. It might also explain the recent focus on cloth masks or face-coverings over masks: by advocating these, there is no competition with the NHS. And although less PR-worthy than collaborations with Rolls-Royce to produce ventilators, other partnerships between government and industry could ensure high-quality cloth masks for everyone in the country.As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the “control group” for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along. But do we want to be?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72bff2a682aaca63053be15e63ffec62981826e/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a32986b61d17de43c8be4e0c960eb5","title":"lockdown kids screen tween culture real world","story":"My five-year-olds’ screen time is creeping up. Yet when we step out into the real world, everything seems more vivid to them “There’s a ghost fish called Hank in Bora Bora,” said my daughter, finding me in the kitchen after a morning spent on screens.“Fiction or non-fiction?” I said. We bring this question, previously raised by the librarian at my girls’ kindergarten, to every hideous video they watch. It makes me feel slightly better about the whole school of YouTube.“Non-fiction?” she said, and after a long pause, “what’s Bora Bora?”Over five weeks of lockdown, my kids’ daily screen time has crept up, along with the age bracket of the stuff that they’re watching. Gone are the days of endless slime videos and Ryan’s Toys. Now it’s hours of Minecraft and Roblox. YouTube is largely out. TikTok is in. I try to filter the content as much as I can, but at five years old, they’re definitely getting a crash course in tween culture. “You’re the worst,” yelled one the other day – it was like a rehearsal of the slammed doors to come.There are various tricks I perform to make myself feel better about all this – chiefly persuading myself that there’s no other way to occupy two five-year-olds and get any work done. I tell myself that, as kids, we all watched uninterrupted hours of TV and still managed to read books and go to college. I remind myself of those parents who severely limit their kids’ screen time and are, invariably, the same fusspot parents who make their kids go to bed early in the holidays and are one step away from making them wear school uniforms at the weekend.And not all of the screen stuff is as bad as it seems. Minecraft, along with Block Craft and its other versions, is less passive than the baby video stuff. You can build and explore. You can get killed by a zombie, or run away from a wolf. In Roblox, a seemingly infinite series of digital worlds, my kids can be in the same game at once, and when I hear them chatting and strategising I breathe a sigh of relief.I’m trying to hold various lines. I won’t pay for in-game accessories, no matter how hard they beg. And after we’ve done a long day at the coalface, there are no screens in the evening. Being inside and online all day has also changed the way we experience the material world. At the weekend, after spending the best part of the week in our apartment, we go out for a walk and the effect is amazing.The sky is insanely blue. The world, as Louis MacNeice put it, is “suddener than we fancy it”. You’d think my kids had never seen colour before. All of us stand, rapt, before a bank of red tulips, while I take a stab at remembering how pollination works. The online world looks suddenly very shallow and dim, and I’m reminded that misinformation exists IRL, too. Later, my daughter looks at me expectantly after the question about Bora Bora. “It’s in a country called Afghanistan,” I say with confidence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ee9dec82c7159d8e7eec96fbf183ab41a7fbdf/476_0_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5006c8bc04dac2194752adf3f7efa4b","title":"newspapers journalists coronavirus press democracy","story":"Journalists are excelling in holding government to account over coronavirus. If the press suffers, so does democracyAt last it is MPs who are asking questions. On Wednesday, after parliament’s long Easter holiday, the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, asked five questions in the House of Commons. But the questions – about statistics, supplies, tests, care homes – have been around for weeks. Ministers have been challenged, comparisons drawn, mendacities exposed. Democratic accountability had functioned, sort of. But not by MPs, by the press.I do not often bang the drum for my industry. Newspapers are institutionally smug. When the coronavirus mess is over, I doubt if the public will line the streets clapping journalists on their way, even if the way is to closure and bankruptcy. Other media have being doing their bit. I have valued the BBC’s More or Less and Briefing Room, and Channel 4’s scientists’ debate. But for a relentless daily alternative to Downing Street’s wooden press conferences, we must turn to the serious press.If this week we were to rely on ministers and their in-house scientists on the question of wearing face masks, we would be clueless. If we had relied on government press statements on Covid-19 deaths, we would never have known they were just deaths in NHS hospitals, not care homes or any other homes. Independent epidemiologists disagreeing with Whitehall’s virus model from Imperial College had to challenge it in newspapers. It has been left to journalists, not MPs, to track down the chaos over protection equipment, key worker testing and the capital’s underused intensive care beds.Of course, media exposure can be the problem as much as the solution. An addiction to human interest and bad news leaves worst-case scenarios and personal tragedies hogging the headlines. The BBC’s News at Ten has become unwatchable for its vox pops of random anguish, merely boosting the government’s message: obey or die. The promotion of fear gets people watching, but it never aids public understanding. Just now, the yawning chasm between known and unknown is too susceptible to the politics of terror.With politicians in absentia, it has been journalists who have had to penetrate ministerial obfuscation. Only with the latest charts from the Office for National Statistics has the UK begun to appreciate what the Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter calls “the only unbiased comparison” of Covid-19 deaths against other and seasonal deaths. That is the figure for “excess mortality from all causes” against a five-year average. It is not happy reading, but at least it means something. No one mentioned it in parliament that I can see. It was in the press.As for the looming debate over “lives versus economics”, that too must be left to the media. The government is in intellectual lockdown over an exit strategy. Alone in the free world, it refuses discussion on the grounds – says the acting prime minister, Dominic Raab – that this would undermine its casually authoritarian policy. This cannot be right. With an economy more jeopardised than it has been since the second world war, and with parliament indolent, deep scrutiny of government strategy is essential. It is also psychologically important for the public. Information is reassurance. Debate is empowering, it allays fear with reason. If ministers want to impose extreme curbs on personal freedom, they must show personal trust.Thomas Jefferson’s famous preference for “newspapers without a government”, if the alternative is government without newspapers, may be stretching a point. It remains strange that so vital a pillar of democracy as an independent and erse press should be at the mercy of a private market. Over the years, that pillar has been damaged by chicanery, bias, vulgarity and sensation. Yet for all that and in most democracies, the market has more or less delivered. In the digital age, that is no longer guaranteed. The newspaper industry is experiencing a bizarre phenomenon, a surge in online popularity amid a commercial meltdown. , the Times, the  and the Financial Times have seen soaring online readership in some cases it has doubled. The craving for reliable, edited, evidence-based news is clearly huge. But it is near impossible to monetise. The bulwark of the press, revenue from advertising and circulation, is plummeting. Newspapers are bearing the costs of good journalism Google and Facebook are garnering the profits. Many local newspapers appear unlikely to survive this crisis, while the outlook for printed papers of all sorts is grim. The predators half acknowledge this. The BBC is already subsidising some local newspapers whose market it has damaged through its local newsrooms. Google is offering grants to small- and medium-sized publications – tossing a liferaft to the ships it has torpedoed. I dislike the idea of state support for an industry whose essence is independent news and debate. Depending on how government acts in the coming months, I still believe most newspapers can keep going. Ministers are already throwing crumbs of NHS advertising in their direction. Last year’s Cairncross report suggested substantial payments from digital platforms to the press organisations that supply them. This might well be part of a wider new order for digital regulation.For the present, newspapers can only continue to bring peace of mind to those enduring the present agony. But if they start to disappear, they would not be just another victim of this government’s coronavirus policy. If they suffer, democracy suffers. Remember Betjeman: “It’s strange that those we miss the most Are those we took for granted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e2fb3c3074b143a366627b69e84118882794f6/0_192_3799_2279/master/3799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95d7b60e1cd18959bac37d96cfb6140","title":"i cant afford rent the students facing hardship during lockdown","story":"University students worry how they will cope financially after losing work and parental supportGrowing numbers of students are asking their universities for financial support during the Covid-19 lockdown amid warnings that more will face hardship as the crisis goes on.Many universities have responded by increasing or creating funds for students in difficulty, with some providing subsidised meals for those who remain on campus. In Scotland, the government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support.The NUS has called on the government to supply a £60 million hardship fund that would provide students with a “safety net” during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students’ tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees.This has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit.Lily Taylor, a master’s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off £90 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. “The hardest part is having no space to study,” she says. “In the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can’t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.”Taylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university’s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. “I’m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I’m worried about how I’m going to be able to complete my dissertation.”Sheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic.Similar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus.But students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master’s student, applied for the University of Birmingham’s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn’t meet requirements.“The university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of £180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,” she says.Some students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves – in campus shops or student unions, for example – and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment.Issy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop.“Those of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven’t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet – four weeks on,” she says. “A coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around £1,000.” In the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. “I have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I’m suddenly in a position where I not only can’t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,” she says. “I also can’t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.”Rent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19.For students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. “If I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,” she says. “I won’t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property. Due to the hands on nature of my degree, I need to be in Birmingham to complete my dissertation. I do not wish to drop out, but this is something I’m unfortunately forced to consider.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b1df72795ce06ae25c7c73dbf6bfd75d1ba117/0_275_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1f67acb0fae7ae5cc77d44a083f7cb","title":"italy home schooling coronavirus lockdown what weve learned","story":"Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence – and the results have surprised everyone. By  Tobias JonesMost of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn’t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.Still, to our three kids – Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) – the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn’t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.But if Italian schools weren’t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children’s learning. But slowly – over the course of two months – something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don’t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of “otium-negotium”, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies – unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve also spent much of my life teaching. I’ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we’ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have “fingers on buzzers”.The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child’s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (“liars’ dice”), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren’t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren’t sharing these cultural delights with our children.The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan “andrà tutto bene” (“it’ll all be fine”), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.The closing of all Italy’s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. “The entirety of this new form of online teaching,” said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, “was created by us teachers at the last minute.”At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn’t only that sites and servers crashed as the country’s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn’t connect at all.At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as “DAD” – didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. “I have an exceptional digital consultant”, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. “He’s 11, and is one of my students. He’s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.”The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren’t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren’t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn’t bring them back into the circle.Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. “I could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,” said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. “I now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.”But school was also being reinvented because Italy’s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they’re bocciato – failed – and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.“Many of my colleagues are really struggling”, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. “Before, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points – 5.4, 5.5.” These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: “A child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.” Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family – parents, siblings and grandparents – all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. “Some of them have lost a grandparent”, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. “Their parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.”At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn’t be the one overloading them, but vice versa – they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: “They no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available”, she said. “They have this need to be immediately reassured – that their work has been received, that it’s OK, that you’re happy with them.”That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces – their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. “There’s no longer the intimidation of the pack,” said one teacher, “and so they’re bringing out what they really know. I’ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.” Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. “It makes you understand”, said Lante, “that we need a very varied form of education”.By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they’re monosyllabic when describing their days at school – “fine” usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn’t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools – boisterous disturbances – suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents’ presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.But there was no timetable to our children’s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn’t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become – if not agoraphobic – certainly “agora-meh”. They wouldn’t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.It’s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if – as a writer – you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought “if they’re not going to read, I’ll read to them”. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. “I just don’t get poetry,” Emma grumbled.Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn’t – outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and – their much-missed English snack – digestive biscuits.It’s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney’s Digging. It’s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It’s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it’s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. “Go on then,” I said, “write it your way.”Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction – “squelch”, “slap”, “rump” – the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren’t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone’s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: “Distance-learning is a strange video game,” he said, “but in the end it’s a torture. A teacher can’t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional – an artificial TV personality.”Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because – without those marks – they have no measure of their offspring’s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me “parents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn’t ‘an eight’ or hasn’t completed the set book. They’re the ones we really need to educate.”Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. “When all this talk about digital learning began back in March,” he said, “I was very, very worried, because it’s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.”Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: “A WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn’t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.”No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only “a willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge”, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, “is how we educate each other together.”It’s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we’ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it’s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that’s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I’m sure we’ve still got a lot to learn.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36943486c8c6d509194adc942ed428fc3ea691fd/0_185_3508_2106/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=343c2c7178a39b2c14f14bcfda61ea26","title":"loss of international student fees could decimate uk research","story":"Coronavirus will put almost every university in financial jeopardy unless the government steps in, vice-chancellors say As university researchers race to find a way out of the coronavirus pandemic, top institutions are warning that losing at least half their international students will blow a huge hole in their research budgets and lead to cuts in vital scientific projects.But it is all the more painful because universities have been relying on the surplus from international students’ higher fees to subsidise vital research.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “The rhetoric around the budget was all about making Britain a great global science nation, but without international students, that can’t happen.”Vice-chancellors say that almost every university will be in financial jeopardy if the government refuses to give them any support.Prof Colin Riordan, of Cardiff University, a member of the elite Russell Group, says: “Any university that hasn’t got substantial reserves will be at risk. There is barely a university that will be able to last without significant help from the government. Lots would struggle to last beyond a year or so. At the very least, we need some help to buy us some time.”Last week the Treasury was said to be blocking an appeal by the vice-chancellors’ group, Universities UK, for a multibillion-pound bailout. Without it, the group says some institutions will certainly go bankrupt. A report by London Economics for the University and College Union found that universities faced a £2.5bn black hole from the loss of tuition fees, and without government intervention, 300,000 jobs would go. Hepi has found that on average every international student pays £5,000 more than it costs the university to teach them. The thinktank says universities typically spend most of this surplus on propping up research, a crucial activity because most funding bodies only pay around three-quarters of what it costs the university to carry out a research project.“International students subsidising research is a huge deal,” Hillman says. “What happens if all that goes? It’s quite simple. You do less research.”Riordan agrees. “Universities are playing an absolutely pivotal role in the crisis, in understanding what is going on and developing routes out of it. Research is critical to that. But at the same time that research is being propped up by a revenue stream that is massively threatened by the virus.”The most prestigious universities say they are being hit with a double whammy because they are the most dependent on international student fees, and also are doing far more research than other universities. Another Russell Group head says some members would need to take in “several thousand extra home students” to make up the lost revenue, “which they just can’t do”.Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, says the extent to which international students support research is “not widely understood”.Riordan says that there is “profound pessimism” in the big research universities about how the crisis could play out if the government fails to step in.Universities UK is lobbying ministers for a multibillion bailout package to stave off financial disaster for many institutions. Among its requests is a plea for government to double research support funding from £2bn to £4bn a year, as well as providing extra assistance for universities relying on high numbers of international students.One senior academic close to Westminster told the  that any help from the government would almost certainly come with strings attached. One condition might be to push struggling modern universities at the bottom of the sector to shift towards shorter and cheaper vocational courses at pre-degree level. This would be controversial, moving back in the direction of the pre-1992 system, when there were polytechnics and universities.Hillman, who used to be a government adviser, says: “There are definitely people in Whitehall who think that what should happen at the end of this crisis is a reshaped HE sector with some universities looking more like polys, with less emphasis on degrees.”However, he says this would be a “dangerous” mistake because, although Britain is lagging behind countries such as Germany on vocational skills training, persuading more people to stay on and gain skills after GCSE should not mean depriving young people of the chance to get a degree.“Many students in universities are doing vocational training anyway. They aren’t sitting around learning Latin, they are training to be pharmacists or nurses, and this crisis has shown us how important those advanced skills are.”The idea is that this would stop prestigious universities from hoovering up thousands more home students to compensate, with universities lower down the food chain struggling to fill places and facing ruin.He says that if even 10 large universities at the top do this, that would have a big knock-on effect lower down the chain.Riordan can understand the anxieties lower down the sector, but says: “If the outcome is that there isn’t enough money to support crucial research, then clearly everyone will try to get as many students as they can.”Prof Anne Carlisle, vice-chancellor of Falmouth University, says that even though her university is not as reliant on international students as other institutions, it is bracing itself for an impact on recruitment. “We are still anticipating a scenario in which fewer UK students decide to enrol because of the uncertainty – though I feel the worst thing a student could do right now is defer, or not complete their degree, and join the unemployment queue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526881daf2daa8f50bd3e9345fb1ad7d4d568ec/0_191_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03f76549143dbbaa01f75ce69e2f8d9","title":"coronavirus detected particles air pollution","story":"Exclusive: Scientists examine whether this route enables infections at longer distancesCoronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.The work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.The Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.Leonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.“I am a scientist and I am worried when I don’t know,” he said. “If we know, we can find a solution. But if we don’t know, we can only suffer the consequences.”Two other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air.A statistical analysis by Setti’s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.Neither of the studies by Setti’s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.Previous studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.The potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people’s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further.Experts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets.But researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Prof Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. “It is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.”He said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China.Setti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer.Prof Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. “It is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.”Other research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7072707fd8718820aa68d5b5dcadaa1c0aa3e8c/0_40_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6dab591bde33a7dd7d87ee2eb01d8253","title":"john hannah id rather take the bins out that binge watch tv","story":"In the latest of our series in which artists share their viewing recommendations, the Sliding Doors actor confesses his boxset scepticism and discusses our obsession with Miss MarpleThe wife and I are in the middle of Devs. I like a bit of sci-fi.

Acid is, in my opinion, the most important and most forgotten aspect of cooking, and these recipes use vinegar as an accent – a highlight, a top note – that brings a plate of food together. A welcome pick-me-up for us all just now.A buttery bowl of comfort pepped up with a quick pickle. You can, of course, take liberties with the recipe based on what you have at home: the veg can be swapped, the ginger left out, and the coconut milk, though nice to have, is by no means necessary. You could even use split peas if you have them, just soak them in cold water overnight first.For the dal200g red lentils1 onion, grated1 carrot, grated (or a bit of fennel, a celery stick or a parsnip)2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly choppedA thumb of ginger, peeled and grated1 tsp coriander seeds, bashed or ground coriander1 tsp ground turmeric400ml vegetable stock or water1 x 400ml tin coconut milk or 400ml more waterFor the pickle200g veg of your choice (carrots, squash, cabbage, greens, raw beetroot, radishes)1 small red onion2 generous pinches salt1 tsp sugar or honey1 tbsp red wine vinegarFor the spiced butter2 tbsp butter or ghee (vegans: use coconut oil)2 tbsp whole spices (cumin, coriander, fennel, mustard seeds)First, wash the lentils. I do this in the sink in a big bowl, filling it with water and washing the lentils with my hands about three times, until the water is less dusty and clear-ish.In a large saucepan, gently fry the onion, carrot, garlic and ginger in a little oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the spices and fry for a couple of minutes, stirring all the time. Next, add the lentils, stock and coconut milk to the pan and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and leave to bubble away for about an hour (you could cook it in less, but I like the lentils to be really soft and buttery).Grate the veg for the pickle and finely slice the onion. Put the onion in a bowl with the salt, sugar and vinegar and use your hands to scrunch the onion, then stir in the rest of the grated veg.Warm the butter or ghee in a small pan, add the spices and put on a low heat until the mustard seeds begin to pop and release their aroma. Serve the dal in deep bowls with the pickle on top and the spiced butter for spooning over.I use this basic brine to pickle any vegetable. My favourites are cauliflower (with mustard seed), carrots (with coriander seed), red cabbage (with caraway seed), and radishes (with slices of fresh ginger). Harder, crunchier vegetables are best cut thinly.500g veg of your choice (see intro)250ml white-wine vinegar50ml water1 tbsp salt1 tbsp sugar1 tsp whole spices (fennel seed, coriander seed, mustard seed, caraway seed, cumin seed, star anise)Prepare and finely chop the veg. Put the vinegar and water into a pan with the salt and sugar and bring to a boil. Once at a rolling boil, turn off the heat and add the sliced vegetables and spices.While still hot, carefully spoon the veg into sterilised jars and top with the brine. Store in a cool place until needed once open, keep in the fridge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d38fbb8490725664624cb73b1c4864f6ad1cbf25/0_507_8660_5199/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc916ccb7e4d89a9c39d4495ded5b4bb","title":"what to drink if youre not drinking fiona beckett low no alcohol drink","story":"Whether you’re cutting back or don’t drink booze at all, the no- and low-alcohol market covers all bases these daysAfter a month of gaily swigging wine on a nightly basis on the grounds that there are no school nights right now, I’m getting the impression from friends that they’re beginning to rein back. Not only because it’s bit of a slippery slope – if one drink, then why not two? – but it’s not the best start to the following day. Not to mention an extra source of calories on top of all the cake and home-baked bread which we are now enjoying.As I write, fruit juices are still widely available, but I find them a bit viscous and syrupy to drink with food, and there’s only so much OJ you can put up with in self-isolation. The answer, I find, is to dilute it with water or, better still, water kefir (plus a few drops of orange flower water, if you have some). Or use juices to make cocktails such as a sea breeze (pink grapefruit juice, cranberry juice and lime) or the summery “croquet” I invented for the book: 50ml each of a light gin substitute such as Ceder’s (see panel below) and cloudy apple juice and 100ml cucumber tonic water.

Nothing remarkable there. Until you realise that Cardiff City had three men sent off – one for deliberate handball on the line. Yet Cambridge still couldn’t get three points.My memories of standing on the north terrace that day are pretty hazy. But I distinctly remember being excited that David Elleray was the referee. Who knows what mistake he’d made in the Premier League the week before to be sent down to our level but he was by some distance the most famous person on the pitch. And he meant business.He sent off one of their players before half-time, another with half an hour to go. Finally, with seven or eight minutes left, their substitute Lee Phillips made a decent save and Ellery gave the penalty and sent Phillips off.By then the atmosphere in our end was a mixture of disbelief and hilarity. Eleven v nine was ridiculous enough. It was a training game. But we just could not score. We barely looked like scoring.As Martin Butler placed the ball on the spot – against eight men – I obviously wanted him to score. We’d had our fun. We’d laughed at how we couldn’t beat nine men. Now we’d have both victory and a funny story for later. Butler was a lovely footballer and a decent penalty taker. But Jon Hallworth – all blonde hair and blonde eyebrows – saved it, and Cardiff held on, very briefly going down to seven men when one of their players was stretchered off in injury time.I urge anyone to listen to the Cardiff commentary from that day. I recently mentioned the game on a podcast and the commentator Phil Stead got in touch. “I had just started working for the club and recorded it on a dictaphone to try it out as a new fangled audio download. It was my first and last commentary. We played it on the bus speakers on the way home.”As a one and only commentary, it is sensational – improved by the terrible audio quality and the fact he’s just standing in the away end. The words without the atmosphere don’t do them justice, but it’s quite the monologue.“Elleray must blow up any second. We’re in the third minute of injury time … And it’s all over and Cardiff City celebrate as they draw 0-0 with eight men. A remarkable performance. Cambridge United nil, Cardiff City nil. And we celebrate! We celebrate as if we’ve won the European Champions League! A great day in the history of Cardiff City. And this is emotional … this is emotional here in Cambridge. This is what it’s all about. Cardiff City! The greatest team in the world. Richie Humphries come here my son. And he goes into the City crowd. The man’s a hero. They are all heroes … We are surely the greatest team in the history of football. This is what it’s all about. Man United? No. Chelsea? No. Tottenham? No. Barcelona? No. Real Madrid? No. Cardiff City. That’s what it’s all about!”Sadly for Cardiff, we beat them 4-0 at Ninian Park when it was 11 versus 11 and they got relegated that season, finishing four points below us.From a Cambridge perspective, this game epitomises what it means to be a lower league fan. Most of it is bad. Occasionally hilariously bad.There have been great victories - Chesterfield in the first play-off final at Wembley in 1990. Those cup runs in the 90s – 5-1 v Bristol City in a fifth-round replay in 1990 and 4-0 over Sheffield Wednesday the following year. There have even been stoic defeats - 2-1 to Arsenal in 1991, when Dion Dublin equalised and David O’Leary should have been sent off, but nothing sums up my supporting experience better than a goalless draw against eight men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f4f80d146edda4d37eb8ee9f36fd95b08df0f2/76_170_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b6fad05c89a0a8ec9b48239063a010","title":"manchester united setup seniors help locked down youngsters","story":"Club’s compassionate approach recognises that lockdown life ‘leaves a big hole’ for children ripped from their usual routinesLast Friday I had a good old-fashioned nosy at Ryan Giggs’s kitchen, close enough to check out his fancy light fittings – if only virtually. Like much of the past month, it was a surreal experience, this one conjured up by the youth development team at Manchester United.When, one Saturday morning in 2014, a man in a padded jacket slid along the touchline to hand me his number on a scrap of paper, I looked at him blankly. He said he was a scout for United and would like to get my son down to the development centre to take a closer look. I was pretty dubious – our little boy was only five.Five and a half years later he’s still pulling on the red kit once a week, effervescent with excitement on the drive to Carrington, hidden away among the flat fields and winding lanes just off the M60. In a perverse way, from a parental point of view, we’ve been lucky he’s had all the thrills but not reached the heady heights of the academy, where a much more intense level of commitment and sacrifice is required from all members of the family.It has been a fascinating experience by proxy, watching a erse selection of boys come and go, some fleetingly, others fast-tracked, and trying to work out why each one is special. What unites them is a complete devotion to the game and their football education. There must have been incidents with discipline but I’ve never seen one, and the silence as they train never stops being a surprise. In a way unusual for groups of young boys, there is a real seriousness about their purpose. They are told that they are here for a reason, show it.United don’t over-promise. There seems to be no desire to make the kids too professional, too soon – they just let them play. They try to do cultural things, educate recently the under-12s curated an exhibition at Carrington on Walter Tull, one of the first black footballers and the first black British officer to lead white troops – and United’s senior squad came across from their building to be shown around by the younger boys.A few days into the lockdown, an email arrived from the academy. It was thoughtful, kind. It reminded us that parents are the biggest influence on a child and encouraged reading and a regular bedtime. It went on: “During the coming weeks we still want the boys to enjoy their childhood, explore learning for themselves, use their imagination and be creative. Some of the best learning to take place during this prolonged period of time at home will be created by the boys themselves.” It advised parents “not to force your boys to practise. Let them practise because they are in love with football”.There has been regular contact since. They’ve sent worksheets, encouraged the boys to look after their wellbeing and made a short film of all the fitness sessions that the boys designed and sent in via WhatsApp. And then there are those hour-long Friday morning Q\u0026ampA sessions, each watched by nearly 200 children. The first week they were able to question Michael Carrick the second, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, whose Scando-Manc commitment to the academy sing-songed through each answer then Giggs and, on Friday, comes Marcus Rashford, a local boy who grew up on free school meals, and who in the past few weeks has helped to raise £20m for FareShare, a charity aimed at relieving food poverty.The programme was drawn together from scratch in a few days by the academy head, Nick Cox, and his team. “The consensus was that we had to do something,” says Cox. “Football brings together people from all walks of life. Some boys will be enjoying time with their families, for other boys it will be very difficult some will be struggling financially or health-wise, living in cramped conditions at the top of a block of flats. Some of these kids will normally be with us four or five times a week – it leaves a big hole in their lives.”Before arriving at Old Trafford four years ago, Cox was at Watford and Sheffield United. Both have great youth setups but United is different. It is just so huge and has, in Cox’s words, “an absolute commitment to youth which surpasses all others”. Last December the club celebrated their 4,000th consecutive game with an academy player in their match-day squad, a sequence going back 82 years. Cox has had no problem persuading big names to help him with his Friday interviews: “It is what Manchester United is about – they all understand the value of the academy.”This is just one small story about a huge club. It has nothing to do with the vats of cash swilling around at the top – though huge sums are ploughed into the academy – and everything to do with human relationships at ground level, supporting the boys and girls who are never happier than with a ball flicking, flicking, at their toes. Alongside United continuing to pay casual staff despite there being no games for them to steward, and City and United giving a joint donation to Greater Manchester food banks, it illustrates that nothing is simple that Premier League football may be greedy and selfish, but it can also be life-enhancing and compassionate.It is quite possible, of course, that none of those boys hanging on to Giggs’s every word as he advised young wingers, and admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson could be “a scary man”, will make it as a professional footballer. But they might remember that during a very confusing time in their lives, when their freedoms disappeared and the thing they loved best was taken away, their club didn’t forget them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5214d323b3d39be6991be67e9282f10ba543282/0_319_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e575a37559256e23c0dd9500ba4e31ac","title":"travis scott concert fortnite more than 12m players watch","story":"The US rapper performed inside the popular Battle Royale game with a visually astonishing set, and has announced more datesThe live music event of the year may just have taken place, unaffected by the global lockdown – and within a video game.

But under lockdown, it’s always quietI live in the keepers’ lodge in London zoo. It’s a big shared house on site where eight zookeepers run a rota to care for the animals and man phones overnight. My mum loves telling people I live in Regent’s Park. I grew up in an animal-loving household. At one point there was me, Mum and Dad, two cats, two dogs, two rabbits, a hamster, a tortoise and a cockatoo, so it is normal for me to be surrounded by animals.After studying marine biology at university, I worked for the RSPCA, taking in injured seals and ducklings near the Norfolk coast. But I had always had my sights set on London zoo. For two weeks, I went there every day, handing out my CV to anyone in a suit until I got an interview. I started work as a zookeeper in November 2001.Eleven years later, I applied for it to become my home, too – a select group of experienced keepers are allowed to live on site in the lodge. It’s an experience like no other, and one every zookeeper wants. There’s a competitive interview process which includes vetting, problem-solving, and an assessment of your housemate credentials. It took me three attempts, but I eventually made the cut.The responsibility was scary when I first moved in. Tiny noises startled me. I didn’t sleep for a month, even with security on site. These days, though, I consider it home. Every morning I wake up at seven when our gibbon, Jimmy, starts singing loudly. I take a coffee into the garden and chat to the harrier hawks and the ibis in the aviary behind the house. We’ve hand-reared baby animals in our lodge. We took turns to feed our sloth, Edward, through the night when his mother couldn’t, and built him a jungle gym from broom handles. Beanie, a newborn giant anteater, lived with us, too.The best time is sunset, when the gates have closed. I’ll take a walk around and hear Bhanu, our male lion, roar and the ringtail lemurs crawl out and relax it sounds as if they’re chuckling.A keeper will say they don’t have favourite animals, but it’s a lie. Mine are small monkeys called emperor tamarins. I helped a pair breed a family of 10 by playing Barry White when I worked in the rainforest house.I’m on overnight duty three times each fortnight, which can involve sleepless nights: answering building alarms, administering medicine to animals or taking calls from the public. Sometimes they’ve found injured animals, which we refer on to the RSPCA. Occasionally someone says an animal has escaped but I’ve never known it happen. Once, the police called for advice when a bag of snakes was dumped outside a tube station.In normal times, I’m allowed to have friends over – as long as they don’t wander off – and we’re close to central London so I can go to the pub when I’m off-duty. My wife of two years lives down the road. When I’m not on duty, I’ll go to her or she’ll be here with me. When we got married, we took our guests around the zoo before opening time.Coronavirus has changed everything. On 21 March, the zoo closed to the public for the first time since the second world war, so it’s always quiet now. Some keepers moved into our overnight visitor experience lodges and about 50 staff are still working shifts. I miss answering visitors’ questions and showing off our animals. The pygmy goats miss being petted and are getting extra massages from staff. We’ve hidden food for the meerkats to find, and puzzles for the squirrel monkeys. The big cats are less fussed and enjoy the spring sunshine.We wear personal protective equipment to prepare food and activities. Colds have passed between humans and primates we’re unsure if coronavirus can, but it’s important to be safe.The animals are being well looked after but this is still a worrying time. The zoo is a charity, so entry tickets fund our conservation work, which filters through to scientists in the field. That’s all dried up now.Living and working here is an unusual existence but, at 42, it can’t get any better for me. I have animals in my back garden that are threatened or extinct in the wild. Even though we’re in lockdown, if I feel low I can stretch my legs and have a chat with a lion or an okapi. It’s a dream job. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.• As told to Deborah Linton.Do you have an experience to share?

Am I alone? It’s seven years too late to askMy wife and I decided to see what all the fuss is about with this show called Game Of Thrones. I would like to say I haven’t seen it because I haven’t got round to it, but the truth is I have a history of not engaging with things for the sake of being a contrarian. Everybody was talking about it and so I wilfully avoided it, although I was pretty sure I would like it.I have given up on that philosophy. I saw a post on Facebook, something like: “I have never seen a single episode of The Sopranos and people look at me like I’m a unicorn.” I realised I didn’t want to be that unicorn and watched all six series of The Sopranos in a single sitting.You can get misled by the hype. For the best part of last month, social media was comprised entirely of “How mental is Netflix’s The Tiger King?!” posts. I was so suckered by it that I was expecting the story of a man who ejaculates wild cats and raises them as his gay lovers. It was a great show, but the effect had been softened for me.I had no such problems tucking into Game Of Thrones. All I remembered from the days when everyone was talking about it was that it has dragons, bare breasts and a terrible ending. So we sat down to watch it with little expectation beyond that.It is, of course, brilliant. But I have issues, mainly that it was only in season six that I began to understand who everyone was. The sheer quantity of character information and backstory that the show is constantly smashing into your head is hard to take. It makes me acutely aware of the fact that you can hold only a finite amount of working information in your head one day very soon, I am going to forget my online banking password because I know way too much about the Targaryen family tree.But the main thing that has shocked me has been the brutality of the violence. You see people getting their throats slit as often as you see them eating. Everybody dies, and rarely peacefully. One character gets arrowed to death on the toilet. Unexpected death and violence seems imminent for every single person, yet none of them seem to show the slightest degree of anxiety.It’s my reaction to the violence, however, that I have found most surprising. I have gone from somebody who doesn’t mind any level of gore to a pearl-clutcher of the highest order. On occasion, I have looked away from the screen or gasped. It has been a voyage of discovery. My wife feels the same way, and we have wondered if we are weirdos, but the problem with watching a show so late is that you can’t discuss it with other people. I’m not going to phone my friends and say, “Do you remember in Game Of Thrones about seven years ago when they had that Red Wedding? That was mad, wasn’t it?”I presented an award alongside Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark, a few years ago. I had not watched a single episode of Game Of Thrones at the time. I am so annoyed now that I didn’t tell her how brilliant she was, even if I know I would have fan-boyed horrifically, before saying: “Isn’t it ever so violent, though?”We will be sad to say goodbye to Game Of Thrones this week, as we watch its final episodes. We are, however, looking forward to starting on our next brand-new show: Breaking Bad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2104a1c6efc717d24bc29b9766fa8f8cd068ca/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf57269c41d6b52a7b8711c9a5344f06","title":"i slept with my best friends ex now im terrified of confrontation","story":"Your reluctance to have a conversation with her could mask a deeper desire to always be in control, says Annalisa BarbieriI have a fear of confrontation. Recently, this destroyed my relationship with my best friend, after I slept with her ex. I did not tell her for several months, and developed my own twisted logic that I was somehow protecting her from the painful truth. When I did tell her, she made me realise my refusal to tell the truth had hurt her more than the action itself.It’s been a year, and I haven’t spoken to her or her ex (who was also my friend). My way of dealing with the situation was to suppress thinking about it for months and continue with my life. However, partly owing to my relationship with my new partner (who is highly emotionally intelligent), I have started to reflect on the situation. I know I have to recognise my responsibility to myself and others, and become an active, not passive, force in my relationships. I hate the idea of ruining that with my new partner, which is one of the best relationships I have had.This brings me to my main issue. I live with the fear that my best friend will want another confrontation as part of her way of moving on. I am scared of bumping into her in my home town, or having to respond if she messages me. I am conflicted over the fact that perhaps I owe it to her to instigate a meeting. But I am scared that I will talk too much about myself, not listen well enough, or fail to offer anything new, making her feel disappointed for even bothering with me. What can I do?There’s a lot of living in your head going on. Your friend hasn’t made contact with you, and if she did, you are imagining that she wants confrontation. Often when people fear confrontation, it can be traced back to something that happened earlier in life, but it may not be as simple as that, as psychotherapist Lucy Beresford (psychotherapy.org.uk) helped me understand.“I did wonder if your idea of not wanting to have another conversation was less about fear of confrontation and more a masking of a deeper desire to always be in control,” Beresford explained. She went on to say that the way you conducted the affair with your friend’s ex, and then didn’t tell her, was also about “controlling the situation”. This can stem from a fear of angering others and wanting to be liked.This is really worth exploring: think about your interactions with people, and which of these you deem to be successful and which aren’t, and what the difference between them is. What is it about your new partner that has allowed you to learn more about yourself? You may find that, actually, you can talk in a “confronting” way with some people and not with others the reason for this may be telling. It may be down to the combination of personalities rather than just yours.What to do? Beresford suggests sitting down with your partner and exploring exactly what you are afraid of. I know, you think you know, but I want you to really unpack it. Go through each imagined contact with your friend, talk about what it is you fear, what it brings up, and then get your partner to ask you: “And then what?” Being gently challenged to really think, and not come up with hackneyed answers, can throw up surprises.Your friend hasn’t contacted you yet, and she might not. If you wanted to be less passive, you might consider writing her a letter, asking to meet. You can be in control of what you say, and you can even say you fear meeting and not listening, or talking about yourself, so you are writing this letter first.

This is why I don’t feel guiltyBack in the halcyon days of human contact, a friend of mine was decompressing over dinner. She’d learned that (once again) she had not got the promotion she’d applied for. Apparently the interview committee were not sure about her “leadership qualities”, despite her qualification in leadership. They were sure about the young(er) men they hired instead: floppy-haired elite-school types who refused to wear socks and went by nicknames that sounded like abuse (no employee deserves to be reprimanded by someone called Plumpers).My friend told me that she would not put herself up for promotion again. Not for a while, anyway she needed a break. She felt beaten.I told my friend that some people have a less smooth journey in life, where – whether through structural societal problems or just plain bad luck – their days are full of frictions, small hindrances that make things harder and slow their progress. So it’s OK to press pause.Recalling that conversation has helped me avoid feeling guilty about how I’ve spent these last weeks. This is my sixth week working from home and I am yet to start learning Spanish or reading Tolstoy, because this is a period of maximum friction. Everything is harder, takes longer and hurts more: getting milk requires an hour’s queue freezing video calls with friends barely relax heightened emotions mean a simple disagreement turns into a fight.So I remind myself we are not working from home we are surviving a crisis and trying to work. I remind myself that “new pandemic, new you” is not a phrase for a reason. I feel no shame if my personal progress has stalled. In fact, I’d argue that, when it takes all your energy just to stand still, there is no better time than a weekend to say, “Today, world, I am going to give myself a break.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790bdabc9f1055a76b53d2a0a7063525174dff3a/0_121_3721_2233/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6441c37a8566d04eac54e94ec68f43e","title":"brits in lockdown panama beach tribal gathering festival","story":"Panama’s Tribal Gathering was meant to be the ultimate beach party, until coronavirus stranded festivalgoers in a makeshift camp, disconnecting them from their families – and reality• Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellationsIf you’ve ever been at a festival on a Monday morning and thought it was something that might happen at the end of the world, you might have some sympathy for performers and crew at the Tribal Gathering in Panama. The British-run festival – which takes place on the country’s northern coast and brings together indigenous peoples with DJs, artists and performers from around the world for cultural exchange and a three-week beach party – was supposed to end on 16 March. But then came lockdown, in this case enforced by the military.The festival has now been turned into a makeshift camp, with many of its attendees unable to return home and complaining of insufficient flights and strained discussions with embassies. The UK Foreign Office told a  reporter that they were “in regular contact” with festivalgoers, who are scattered between the festival and Panama City.“I’ve been camping on a beach for 80 days!” says Doug Francisco, a circus performer and artist from Bristol. Francisco, who designed and led the Extinction Rebellion red brigades at last year’s protests in London, got to the site at the beginning of February. “While the festival was still going on, the military came in and tried to shut it down,” he told me over the phone from the beach.The organisers persuaded the army to allow the festival to finish. After it was over, the battle became how to leave the site. Confused and conflicting orders were given by the army, festivalgoers report. A busload of travellers was held for 12 hours near the site and those without confirmed flights were turned back. But many flights had been cancelled. Embassies became involved with mixed results. “The British embassy sent a bus, but they just took people to the airport,” says Francisco. “There were no flights and they just left them there. They didn’t sort them out flights or anything. That was when it was all kicking off. I was like, I’m not getting on the bus if I don’t have a flight.” He remained at the festival site, where he has a four-metre bell tent.British festivals such as Glastonbury cancelled, but at Tribal Gathering the show went on, of a sort. About 300 crew, performers and public were still on site days after it was supposed to have ended. “People were dealing with it pretty well,” says Francisco. Because they had been quarantined, they were safe from the threat of coronavirus and could avoid the restrictions the rest of the world was enduring. “This might be the last show on Earth. I did my one-man show the other night to the kitchen crew. We had a drag queen party with cocktails on the beach.”Some of those who managed to leave the festival are still stranded in Panama City. One who got back to the UK was Barry Rees, a tree surgeon from Anglesey. He had gone to Panama to work on the build, turning the wild jungle beach, with its spiders, snakes and rampaging monkeys, into a safe festival site. When it was time to leave, he found his flight had been cancelled. Nevertheless, he managed to get past the armed guards. “I don’t know how I did it,” he told me down the line from north Wales. “I put on my pirate hat, that might have helped.” After borrowing £1,000 from his brother, almost being stranded in Miami and taking four international flights in three days, Rees finally got home. “I was really jetlagged, had diarrhoea, couldn’t really go anywhere. I was thinking, why did I leave paradise? But I didn’t have much money and I didn’t want to be a charity case.”Those who remained got on with the festival takedown, “more slowly and methodically than usual”, says Francisco. The organisers kept the food deliveries coming long after they were meant to have stopped. “They looked after everybody at the hell of a cost for food,” says Rees. The festival has reportedly taken out a $160,000 loan and is also crowdfunding via GoFundMe.“Moving anywhere in the country is complicated – you need permissions, there’s lots of checkpoints,” says Francisco. “There’s all this anticipation trying to leave, we’re gonna go, we’re gonna go, and then it’s – there’s no flights, we can’t go. Well, OK, I’ll stay here rather than getting stuck in a hostel.” Rees says some of the crew managed to get put up for a month in a mansion, but it had nothing in it, not even tables and chairs, and no internet. “They were going out of their minds,” he says. Even now, it may be six weeks before anybody can leave Panama.At the festival, a feeling of unreality was persistent. “There’s a strange sense of this whole coronavirus thing happening that you’re not connected with, which would sound like a dream scenario but is quite weird. And the idea that when we leave here we’re going into a really difficult situation is daunting,” says Francisco. “It’s weird because the whole world’s gone mental and we’re stuck in the old days. We can still hang out and do stuff together, which is a real luxury, but you feel disconnected from what’s going on.”And even paradise can wear thin. “I’m not gonna get much sympathy for being trapped on a beach, but it’s quite an intense environment. It looks picturesque, but the palm trees secrete oil at night and everything gets covered in it. And there’s the dust it’s very windy. After 80 days, I’m gagging for a wall.”Along with Maitane Berrozpe, an artist from Spain’s Basque country, Francisco has been continuing his project Plastik Paradiso, collecting refuse washed up on the beaches and turning it into shamanic-inspired art. “It’s shocking, because where there’s houses or tourist places, it’s all cleaned up, you’ve got this paradise vista, but as soon as you walk around the corner you’re knee-deep in plastic waste. It’s just hideous.” He plans to deconstruct the artworks and fit them into suitcases when he does eventually leave. “Francis Drake used the nearby town of Portobelo to extract all the Inca gold. I’m doing the same with all this plastic,” he says.Even the party at the end of the world has to come to an end. Fewer than 50 people remain on the site and the imminent start of the rainy season is focusing minds. “That’s a different story. We had a couple of days already, it hoots it down, just rivers of mud running down the site.” He may be a veteran of the British festival scene, but there is one extra element that has persuaded Francisco to find alternative accommodation nearby. “All the crabs come out,” he says. “Crabageddon: that’s on the cards in the next couple of weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0bcbcb829219e4d069e711e0c1d6301986d019/280_8_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87308b6d8bfdf012918359698be33024","title":"taylor swift disowns new live album scooter braun big machine","story":"Singer complains of ‘tasteless’ release amid coronavirus crisis by former label Big Machine, owned by frequent adversary Scooter BraunTaylor Swift has disowned a new live album released under her name, calling it tasteless and “shameless greed” amid the coronavirus outbreak.The album, Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008, was recorded when Swift was 18, around the release of her Grammy-winning second album, Fearless. The live album has been released by Big Machine, Swift’s former label that was bought by music manager Scooter Braun from its founder, Scott Borchetta. Swift has frequently criticised Braun and Borchetta – leading Braun to allege death threats from fans to his family – and is planning to rerecord and rerelease her six albums put out by Big Machine to regain some control over her back catalogue.In a post on Instagram, Swift said: “This release is not approved by me. It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros and the Soros family and the Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realised that paying $330 MILLION wasn’t exactly a wise choice and they need money.”She added: “In my opinion … Just another case of shameless greed in the time of coronavirus. So tasteless, but very transparent.”Swift’s criticism of Braun has a long history. After he bought Big Machine, Swift accused Braun of “incessant, manipulative” bullying over the years via orchestrated feuds with his clients Kanye West and Justin Bieber, which Braun denied. She later claimed he was preventing her from performing her own music at US awards ceremony, which Braun also denied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

The UK’s chief negotiator has said the UK will leave the single market and customs union with or without a deal by the end of the year.Barnier said the UK had slowed down progress in the talks, adding it was unacceptable to “impose this short, brief timeline, and at the same time not budgemake progress on some topics that are of importance to the EU”.“The UK cannot refuse to extend the transition, and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas,” he told reporters.Asked whether the EU could request an extension if the British did not, Barnier said it was not up to one side to be the “demandeur” (seeker), but it had to be a common decision for both parties before 30 June, as stated in the withdrawal agreement.“It’s too early from our side to express an opinion on this subject,” Barnier said, adding that the European commission would assess the situation in early June. The transition can be extended by up to one or two years by mutual agreement.The two negotiating teams have been conducting only the second full week of structured talks since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier cited four areas where progress had been “disappointing”, including on a deal on future trade in goods.Barnier said the EU’s offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access to its market in exchange for respecting social, environmental standards and state aid rules would give the UK “unprecedented access” to the European market.But he said the UK had “failed to engage substantially on this topic” and had even “denounced” the basic premise of fair competition.“It argued that our positions are too far to reach an agreement,” Barnier said. “It also denounced the basic premise that economic interconnectedness and geographic proximity require robust guarantees.”Throwing back the often-repeated words of British negotiators, Barnier noted the disparity in size between the two sides. “The UK negotiators keep repeating that we are negotiating as sovereign equals,” Barnier told journalists. “That’s fine, but the reality of the negotiations is to find the best possible relationship between a market of 66 million consumers on the one side of the channel and the market of 450 million consumers on the other side. That is the reality.”He pointed out that devising such level playing field commitments had been agreed as a necessity “with Boris Johnson in our joint political declaration”, which was ratified at the time as the withdrawal agreement.A second problem area, Barnier said. was the UK’s insistence that the future relationship should be made up of a series of separate agreements rather than a single deal with a single arrangement for ensuring compliance by both sides.A third area of “serious difficulty”, he continued, was the UK’s refusal to put into the future treaty that the UK will remain an signatory of the European convention on human rights or recognise the role of the European court of justice in protecting EU citizens’ data when flowing between the bloc and the UK. “This creates serious, serious limitations for our future security partnership”, he said.“We made no progress on fisheries,” an evidently frustrated Barnier commented of a fourth area of difficulty. “On this essential topic the UK has not put forward a legal text. We have made no tangible progress. Despite the political declaration stating that we should make our best endeavours to reach an agreement by July.”The EU will not agree to any future economic partnership does not include the balance, sustainable and long-term solution on fisheries”, Barnier said. “That should be crystal clear to the UK.”During the transition period, the UK is also obliged to implement the agreement in the Northern Ireland protocol to check goods travelling from the rest of the UK on to the island of Ireland.Barnier said that Michael Gove, the minister sitting on the joint committee monitoring such issues, had been “bullish confident” when asked about progress. But Barnier said he needed to see “concrete steps” in establishing the necessary infrastructure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b58df1052d291af55ff254080d324c62f80c3519/748_219_1712_1028/master/1712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b05923f259fcdcaf14f58fe66ca394","title":"who and what uk and eu resume interupted brexit talks future relationaship","story":"In 40 video sessions, teams have been trying to ‘refocus’ on future relationship Brexit talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU resumed this week after a six-week interruption caused by coronavirus.Over five days and 40 video sessions, 10 negotiating teams were expected to provide an urgent “refocus” before the 30 June deadline for both sides to formally agree to extend the transition period if the UK asks for one.Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead negotiator, will host a press conference at noon on Friday in Brussels to give updates, but his team were told on Monday that Boris Johnson was not budging on the issue of the extensions.Barnier’s opposite number, David Frost, opened the first plenary session by “reiterating the government wish not to extend the transition period and that the job could be done by the end of the year”.Some observers said the UK government’s position that an extension is not necessary was astonishing given the depth of the coronavirus crisis.Philip Rycroft, a former chief civil servant at the now defunct Brexit department, told Prospect magazine: “It is simple common sense to ask for an extension of the transition period.”Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank, believes an extension is inevitable but Johnson has “no incentive” to seek one until June, the deadline for a one-off UK request.“A free-trade agreement could still be agreed but it would be hard to implement. Even if we were coming to the end of this pandemic by then, businesses will be not be prepared,” said Lowe, who described himself as optimistic that a free-trade deal could be done by the end of the year, albeit a poor one.This week’s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January.Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered.Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees.Those committees cover the Northern Ireland protocol citizens’ rights British sovereign army bases in Cyprus, the orce bill, Gibraltar and “other separation issues”. Who is on the committees, how often they will meet and precisely what they will be exploring has yet to be disclosed.The Ireland Northern Ireland specialised committee (INISC) will meet for the first time on 30 April. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that the INISC will be “comprised of official-level representatives of the EU and the UK” and will “meet as regularly as required to facilitate engagement between the UK and the EU on protocol implementation”.A working group will also be set up to feed into the committee. TheCabinet Office says it will act “as a forum for the exchange of information and mutual consultation” on implementation. So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group.The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled.Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission’s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive’s director general of international relations.One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where. Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods “at risk” of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland.The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland.This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June. The chances of progress in this week’s talks have been hampered by the failure of the UK to issue a legal text giving detail to how it envisages its new status as an independent coastal state to work. The EU issued text for all areas but the UK issued a partial text. “This means the text the negotiating teams will be discussing is the EU’s text, not the UK’s,” a source said.Gove told parliament as recently as February that the UK needed an army of 50,000 customs agents to deal with cross-border trade from January 2021. It seem unlikely much progress has been made here.The immigration bill, which would have closed the borders to low-paid unskilled workers from January, has been shelved, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced this week. Few believe the government can forge ahead with a change of public attitude to foreign low-paid workers in social care, health, retail and agriculture.The Road Haulage Association has called for the transition period to be extended. It says the industry is on life support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e531881809074a2a8fba30822acee49b6020a55/0_195_3363_2018/master/3363..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6183a3dd4a8e338d7d16a0ba1ab48ab4","title":"change thinking save lives rio nudge unit coronavirus","story":"Behavioural science is being used to tackle some of Brazil’s biggest challenges, from the pandemic to extreme weatherBrazil has been the Latin American country hardest-hit so far by the coronavirus pandemic, with many fearing that deaths from Covid-19 are rocketing well beyond the 2,588 officially recorded so far. The situation is particularly dire for the millions of Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where physical distancing is almost impossible. But Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro doesn’t seem to be taking concerns over the virus seriously, accusing the media of “hysteria”. And he has clashed with Rio de Janeiro’s governor, Wilson Witzel, who has ordered the state’s 17 million citizens to stay at home – and off the city’s beaches.Helping in the effort to keep people safe and away from public areas is NudgeRio, a department in Rio’s city hall that uses behavioural science to influence people’s decisions. The team has helped produce messages to encourage people to stay at home, including a photograph of Ipanema beach with accompanying text that reads: “Rio’s landscape gives the hint. Let’s flatten the curve.”For the past week, city hall has been sending drones around the city with audio messages, created by NudgeRio, to remind people to avoid crowded areas and to wash their hands. “We have produced three messages so far, but will be doing more,” says Jose Moulin Netto, who set up NudgeRio in 2018. The team is also involved in a project to combat growing domestic violence, a global problem exacerbated by lockdown situations. Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler’s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for iniduals and society.The UK government’s early response to the pandemic was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University, pointed out in early March, the UK strategy was an outlier: “If the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the ‘science’?”Before coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its worst level of rainfall in 22 years, with storms that left 10 people dead. Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides. This year alone, about 150 Brazilians have been killed or are missing following heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Summer in the city is always “problematic”, according to Thais Miguelino, a spokeswoman for the Rio operations centre that monitors traffic, accidents and weather and manages crisis situations, including the pandemic. “We need to know how to communicate with people so they know what they need to do,” she says. “The idea is to change people’s thinking so we can save lives.”The centre wants to work out how best to use its social media channels to communicate messages that will encourage people to stay put and avoid travel during a storm, or advise them how to get to a place of safety. To do this, NudgeRio has created different personas, including a mother with a baby and an older person, and seen how they might react to events such as flooding or a landslide.“The rain in Rio is unpredictable and varies according to which region of the city you’re in,” explains Rafaela Bastos, a member of the NudgeRio team. “It’s very important that the population knows how to take decisions in certain situations, to be prepared and reflect on what to do with the information available.” Other NudgeRio projects relate to tax collection, school registration and reducing jaywalking and have led to savings. But the team faces challenges getting people to take nudge seriously and proving the impact of projects. “It’s hard to convince people and to get employees involved,” admits Moulin. Innovation in the public sector is always a challenge, he adds: “The public sector has to abide by certain rules. There are very specific definitions of what you can do. It’s so much harder.”There has also been criticism of the nudge approach. Sometimes it’s seen as a sticking plaster for gaping holes in public services that need more investment. Rio’s summer weather, for instance, has always been unpredictable, yet the same problems keep reappearing, suggesting a more structural approach is required. Moulin and the NudgeRio team acknowledge the pitfalls but remain excited by the potential impact. They cite a project with the city’s education department as an example. Every two years, the Brazilian government holds a national exam to measure the academic performance of public school students aged 10-11 and 14-15, with a mock test a month beforehand. Last year NudgeRio was asked to try to increase participation and students’ grades.“I can’t emphasise it enough,” says Moulin. “This message was sent at 7.30pm in the evening on the day before the exam and yet there was a significant increase in grades. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fa762b78fe4c467efa592b9ac2423519231782/0_0_3392_2035/master/3392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0fd306971dc7c592f63073a004953b4","title":"bbc and sky show fifa 20 matches as world sport goes online","story":"Esports and video games including ePremier League fill vacuum left by coronavirusOn Saturday afternoon, Sky Sports viewers will be treated to the semi-finals and final of a new football tournament, with an impressive array of players including Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Wilfried Zaha.But the tournament, which is also being aired on BBC iPlayer, will be different to previous televised competitions. Due to Covid-19, it will be held in the Fifa 20 video game over two hours.The ePremier League Invitational Tournament is a charity event, with selected footballers gaming to raise funds for the NHS (and occupy their time).With the sporting calendar frozen around the world, this is the latest example of broadcasters turning to video games to fill slots in schedules that would previously have gone to more physical activities.“We had been preparing for one of the biggest summers we’ve ever known,” says Ben Gallop, BBC Sport’s head of digital. “The usual stuff: the end of the Premier League, Wimbledon, the Opens, cricket, then Euro 2020, and the Tokyo Olympics. And then slowly, it dropped off one by one.“But there was a really strong audience need, even as events fell away. What really struck me is that our audience is still coming to us, to BBC Sport, even though there isn’t any live sport. People are, across the country, in a pretty parlous state, and everyone needs what the BBC is able to provide: we inform and educate, but also we entertain. We bring people together around the actual live events, and we wanted to carry on doing similar.”The BBC is airing two other digital sports over the weekend: the fourth and fifth stages of the Digital Swiss 5, a gruelling 37km cycle race over a digital recreation of the Schallenberg mountain and the first leg of the Formula E Race at Home Challenge, which sees real drivers from the electric race car league competing across eight digital recreations of real tracks.Unlike Fifa, which is clearly a video game, these races are far closer to being digital recreations of the sports they are mimicking. The cyclists are riding their real bikes on turbo trainers, which mimic the resistance of a hill climb, while the racing drivers are using the same sort of simulation software that their teams use to tune up their cars before actual races.Formula One, which has also launched an esports replacement, is using a game, F1 2020, that falls in the middle of the simulator-game spectrum. That can provide for entertaining crossovers between the virtual and real worlds, says Hazel Southwell, a motorsports journalist and esports fan.“There are two F1 drivers who were on a sim racing team in their spare time, and no one knew. They’re two of the younger ones, and so little attention was paid that they joined an esports team. One of my friends was watching a virtual race and said, ‘I think that’s Max Verstappen.’”The crossover with real sports is crucial for engaging audiences, says Gallop. With Fifa, for instance, “you’re seeing household names, in their own homes. You’re seeing their real competitive instincts – they’re dedicated to winning – and you’re seeing that tribal element of football. I found myself strangely invested in watching Moussa Sissoko’s performance in the ePremier League, because I’m a Spurs fan. I was absolutely gutted when he was out of the running.”If the drought of sports continues, Gallop suggests, the next step may be to look further into the world of esports. The fear is that, while airing an esports mainstay like the fantasy battle Dota or the footballracing hybrid Rocket League may bring younger audiences to the BBC, it could alienate those who don’t understand what’s going on. But, Southwell argues, people have a natural instinct to care about competition.“We’ve all had that experience with the Winter Olympics of seeing something called, like, ‘downhill bell throwing’, where you tune in on day one to see what it is, and by the end of the Olympics you’re saying, ‘oh what a clanger’, when someone’s form is off.“Well, a lot of the things that make esports good are the same things that make real sports good and watchable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5cda3058067202f43ff7cf1f28d4d813cb6a23/0_204_3701_2221/master/3701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f920e0aebfb309f69d2734c828cc92f","title":"london marathon race director admits event may include only elite runners","story":"The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal.Hugh Brasher told the  that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning around 10 other options because of the global pandemic.“The flame is still burning,” said Brasher. “And is there hope? Absolutely. But you have to do what’s right for society. You usually have 750,000 people out in central London watching 45,000 runners. Then there’s the medics, the 6,000 volunteers and the transport system. There’s masses to take into account when making any decision.”When asked directly whether the London Marathon – which was due to take place this Sunday before being pushed back – might have to be only for elite athletes if social restrictions had not eased completely, Brasher replied: “Honestly, I don’t know. But in today’s society, you can never say never. We are trying to stay really agile and to keep scenario planning. And at the moment, I don’t want to discount anything until it becomes really impossible.”Last month’s Tokyo marathon was staged as an elite-only race, with the field reduced to just 300 runners and the streets largely deserted. Most major spring marathons subsequently decided to postpone their races to the autumn – but those events also look in doubt with no vaccine in sight and, ominously, the Berlin marathon has already cancelled its race in September.“Our decision will be made by the back end of August at the latest,” explained Brasher. “It will be based on the government guidelines, and what we and society think is right and what feels right.”Brasher would not confirm whether Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, who were due to meet on Sunday in a clash for the ages, had signed up for October’s revised race. However he told the : “We always want to get the most competitive race. This was going to be the 40th London marathon, and its greatest race. It was going to be spectacular. But we want to make October 4 spectacular too. So that’s what our focus is.”Last year the London Marathon raised £66.4m for charities, again making it the biggest single-day fundraising event in Britain. And while Sunday’s race will not take place, organisers are still hoping that thousands of people will spend the day raising and donating money for charities as part of a nationwide 2.6 Challenge – in which people tackle something related to the numbers two and six.More than £1.5m has already been raised for the campaign, and Brasher said he hoped it would prove a lifeline for many charities which usually rely heavily on the race to fund their work.“The London Marathon is normally about so many scripts and so many stories,” said Brasher. “It’s the greatest athletes in the world with the everyday athlete – who are doing this incredible challenge with the gods of the sport such as Kipchoge, Bekele and Brigid Kosgei, on the same day, on the same course, with the same crowd. In fact, the everyday person gets more people watching them. That’s the incredible thing. And, of course, they are raising so much money for charity too.”“Sadly it’s estimated charities will lose £4bn in income as a result of the pandemic. But they are needed more than ever – and they will be needed more than ever as we come out the other side. That’s why we came up with the idea of the 2.6 Challenge, because charities are such an intrinsic part of society and they need our help.“The response has been fantastic,” he added. “And we really hope that Sunday and beyond will show how much we care as a society for all the charities that exist across the UK that underpin a huge part of what makes Britain great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807b538573d19eac5591668374a744bb4fc3bb70/32_0_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bef8c3340c0bb107eab3b408d14e7b7","title":"nfl virtual draft television abc espn","story":"As a TV event, the NFL’s lockdown draft felt slapdash, a little weird and less eventful than those in recent years. It was also the first time in over a month things felt slightly back to normalThe first round of the NFL draft should have been a series of fireworks, owing as much to do with the wonky set-up the league found itself in. The mock run-through had been a veritable disaster – a spouse pulling a plug on a GMs computer, the technology chopping in and out, general managers struggling to fly solo in trying to figure out the technology and trade situations.Chuck a bunch of high-wattage, ready-to-go, star players, from high-profile schools at the most important positions in the game, and we should have been in for a broadcast that was equal parts exhilarating and weird.And then … blah. The draft went off, more or less, without a hitch, unless you happen to share a home with Aaron Rodgers. The technology worked fine. The broadcast networks did a commendable job of patching it all together. The teams sat and waited, no one was willing to mortgage their future to jump into the top 10 or shuffle up towards the top five with so much uncertainty over what the next season might look like.Given the downsized feel and general unease of the whole operation, there was a lack of zest running throughout the broadcast. Teams at the top of the board didn’t help their decision-makers were altogether too sensible. The quarterback-needy teams hoovered up the best signal-callers, while Oakland grabbed the quickest available receiver. The Patriots traded down, as they do.The first eight or so picks went off exactly as projected and had mostly been confirmed by the broadcast network’s own talent in the run-up to the first round. The only real action came when Oklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb slipped to the Cowboys and the Packers traded up to grab Utah State quarterback Jordan Love.Things were supposed to ignite with the third pick, if not the fourth then fifth. Teams were calling about trades, we heard. ESPN’s cacophony of voices was happy to say Joe Burrow and Chase Young would be selected first then second, then the real fun would begin. But that anticipation was met with a collective pffft when everything ran chalk. Without that initial spark, everything fell a little flat.The virtual draft removed all of the excesses and indulgences that make the event so wacky and wonderful in the first place. ESPN leaned into the human interest side of things – understandable given current circumstances – but it left little room for talk of football or team-building or what’s next and stripped an awful lot of fun out of an event that is, objectively, ridiculous. Remove the hilarity of the thing and you’re just left with Roger Goodell delivering his best humanoid impression as he reads 32 names. It’s a little dry.Without an obnoxiously large stage and a crowd and the analysts all sat at a desk together, there was a loss of all of the pomp and circumstance that has come to make the NFL draft such a fun and funky show. The broadcast partners did their best to inject in some of that flavor, offering an overwrought serving of all things Americana. There were shots of a flyover, a musical crossover, and the flogging of anything and everything that could leave you with a hangover. Nobody does chest-beating then beer selling like the National Football League, pandemic be damned.The most interesting subplot of the night: evaluating the home décor choices of all of our main protagonists. Does so and so have an aquarium? I like Mike Zimmer’s fireplace. What’s on Bill Belichick’s book shelf? Is Jerry Jones making his picks from a $250 million mega yacht? Yes. Yes, of course he is. Is Jerry the only one practicing social distancing? I did not have that in the office pool.Why the main broadcast team didn’t have someone on to ponder these questions remains a mystery. A little color, a little fun would have been most welcome.It was left to Goodell to provide the levity. As always, he stole the show. Some standout moments:The draft, at its core, is about hoping and dreaming. Draft picks and prospects can be anything! Much of its entertainment value is in the discussion of football philosophies and economics and team building. But to work as a primetime TV event, it also needs all the bells and whistles – or to lean completely into the nerdy analyst stuff. Thursday night was a little slapdash, a little stuck in the middle, unsure what tone to take and when. And how could it not be given the circumstances?Regardless, for many, this writer included, Thursday was the first time in over a month that things felt slightly back to normal. This year’s first round was different, a little weird, and less eventful than those in recent years. But it was nice to just feel a little bit back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f8e8f6e388dc87f14b07aa4bb956de45052557/1006_1960_4017_2409/master/4017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bedb4c55b6f02dabfd3a2cedbe451533","title":"government must stop dodging and waffling on covid 19 says david hare","story":"Playwright and director, recently recovered from coronavirus, gives damning verdict of government’s crisis response on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme David Hare has said the UK government needs to “own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth”, while giving his own damning verdict of its handling of the Covid-19 crisis.The playwright and director – who is arguably the most celebrated living stage writer in the UK – has recently recovered from the virus. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government’s handling of the situation is worse than the Suez crisis or the Iraq war.Hare said: “To watch a weasel-worded parade of ministers shirking responsibility for their failures and confecting non-apologies to the dead and dying has seen British public life sink as low as I can remember in my entire lifetime.”The playwright, who has had a 50-year career in theatre – writing plays including Plenty, Racing Demon and Stuff Happens – said that “in return for lockdown, isolation, commercial disaster and social distancing” the British public deserves honesty.“They must own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth,” he continued.Hare spoke about what it was like to have the virus, which he said would evolve rapidly and unpredictably. “One day it would be fever, next day it would be arctic cold, then it would be vomiting, then coughing, then conjunctivitis, then breathing problems,” he said. “Day 10 was five times worse than day five.”He dismissed those who claimed that “courage and love of life” had seen Boris Johnson through his coronavirus illness. “Those of us who’ve had the virus know you don’t under any circumstances ignore it,” he said. “What helped me survive were pure luck and the assiduous expert care of my first-class GP. Those two things only, not my fabled resources of character.”Hare has been an outspoken critic of the Conservative party since the 1970s and in 2016 wrote a  long read which argued that Thatcher and her heirs had created a selfish and ided society in which politicians and the people regard each other with mutual contempt.Hare also criticised austerity while praising doctors and nurses who have been “nobly putting their grievances behind them” to care for the sick. He also called for more research so that the Covid-19 virus is understood. “Unless we seek not just to treat the virus’s symptoms but to understand its hold and spread we are doomed to fail,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363f8202a700efe94a94e59fc911d9f1e9088971/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e9554d34a92fe58154d2c8b35120894","title":"let there be light the new must have for celebrities lockdown","story":"As personalities and the public film themselves at home, sales of quality lighting kits have risenThe new opposition leader, Keir Starmer, was photographed leaving his house in north London earlier this week carrying a piece of lighting equipment, an Interfit three-head fluorescent lighting kit with boom arm (£239.99), presumably to use for an online interview or the kind of Zoom meetings that have become central to many people’s lives. With the professional lighting of TV studios no longer available since the lockdown began, those who usually depend on it – from TV reporters to chat-show hosts – are having to set up their own lighting at home, meaning companies like Interfit have seen a spike in sales for some of its kits. Judging by Starmer, these lighting skills may be new to many public figures – as Lexi Powner, a creator of online videos, points out, Starmer was carrying the light fully assembled when it could be folded down and put in a case. “That’s like walking around with an open umbrella,” she says. “It’s like this performative ‘don’t worry guys, I’ll bring my own lights’. It’s so ‘dad on TikTok’.”But Starmer is right to worry about being well lit. “It makes it look professional,” says Powner. Something that is perhaps particularly important for politicians: “For people like Keir Starmer, they are talking to us about life or death policies,” says Roz Morris, the managing director of media training company TV News London and a former BBC and ITV broadcaster. “He’s a serious person and he wants to look like one.”The right location can also help with lighting, as the director of Channel 4’s The Steph Show, which is being filmed at presenter Steph McGovern’s home, explains. “We got very lucky with the living room as it has a lot of natural light,” says John Adams. “We use simple panel lights to just help lift levels on Steph’s face.”For those outside the public eye, the long arms of Zoom and Skype are forcing many to think about their video appearance. There are lessons that Starmer – and the rest of us – could learn from the stars of TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. So-called selfie ring lights have been big business. “A small ring light will help to lift the complexion and bring radiance to counteract any shadows that may appear,” says Hayley Hall, a beauty influencer who has a YouTube channel and more than 27,000 Instagram followers. She uses the Selvim selfie ring (£27.99). “If you are concerned about remaining professional and looking your best then the light essentially lifts the shadows that can make you look tired.”With professional life shifting further online, “this is a whole new world of skills people are having to take on and lighting is vitally important,” says Morris, who has seen a recent uptick in demand for her services – a webinar she is running next week has 800 registered guests rather than the usual 300.“As people had to learn to use computers, now they have to learn to use online image,” she says. “People have made the mistake of thinking this is just a kind of visual phone call but it isn’t. It’s a professional encounter in which they have to be like a producer and director.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It is a sharp increase that appears to dash hopes that the country has reached a plateau in its battle against the virus. The near-record jump in cases brought the total to 68,622, with nearly half of those in Moscow. Sixty people with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 615, Russia’s official crisis response centre said.Donald Trump has said Boris Johnson sounded “incredible” on a phone call with him after he was discharged from hospital, prompting speculation that the prime minister will return to work soon. The US president revealed details of their conversation at one of his regular press conferences in which he claimed Johnson, who was in intensive care with coronavirus earlier this month, sounded “ready to go”.The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Friday, with some countries easing restrictions and others tightening them. Egypt is to ease its coronavirus lockdown by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a nighttime curfew. The United Arab Emirates has cut a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am, instead of from 8pm.Trump also said he may extend federal social distancing guidelines to the summer. It came as Congress approved a $484bn coronavirus relief package, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far. Also in the US, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren revealed her older brother had died after contracting Covid-19.The number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month, with 367 new deaths reported on Friday, Reuters has reported.

Senior executives from the three companies are to appear before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee on Thursday.In the last week alone reports have emerged of hacking attacks on the World Health Organization, and the US National Institutes for Health, with the WHO reporting a fivefold increase in cyber-attacks on both itself on on the public using the imprimatur of the WHO.While some of the activity has been criminal and others linked to so called dark PR firms, who work with governments, and the far right other malicious activity has been laid at the door of governments – including disruptive messaging to US mobile phones that has been blamed by US officials on China.In that incident, according to the New York Times, millions of cell phone and social media accounts in March were bombarded with a fake message, including one saying the Trump administration was about to deploy troops to enforce a lockdown.While Russia and China have been the focus of scrutiny for some of the attacks, others have originated in the US mirroring misinformation and untruths propagated by Donald Trump and his key supporters – including on a significant minority of newly created social media accounts.The WHO and its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus have been among the main targets for digital attacks since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The attacks have included racial abuse and cartoons of Tedros, an Ethiopian microbiologist and diplomat, as a dog on a lead being held by Chinese president Xi Jinping.Earlier this month Tedros said he had been subjected to racist abuse and death threats and said many of the attacks had originated in Taiwan, which has complained of being excluded from critical WHO deliberations.Tedros noted that Taiwan’s foreign minister had not disassociated itself from the attacks, an observation Taipei rejected as “slander”. The attacks appear to have gathered momentum since Donald Trump began blaming the organisation for the slow US response to the pandemic.First Draft, a nonprofit coalition investigating internet disinformation, carried out an analysis of 15,000 tweets in the week between 14 and 22 April 14 which used the hashtags #tedrosresign and #tedrosliedpeopledied.About a sixth of a sample of 1,200 accounts contained the tag #maga, associated with Trump supporters.“This is ... an unprecedented opportunity to study how online information flows ultimately affect health outcomes,” the open letter said, signed by the Committee to Protect Journalists, EU DisinfoLab and other groups, and first reported by the Verge. “The data will be invaluable to those working in public health, human rights, science and academia.”Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which studies digital threats to civil society, told the  that while the spike in malign online activities that had emerged in the coronavirus crisis reflected often different behaviours and interests, together they amount to a “perfect storm” of disinformation.“It’s hard to quantify how widespread it is but there is threat analyst group I know of tracking 12 nation states and other organisations, both public and private, are reporting a sharp increase.While Deibert cautions that such campaigns have been seen before, even in the pre-internet era around well documented attempts by Russia to spread disinformation blaming the US for Aids, what has contributed to the intensity of this disinformation war has been a combination of global connectivity and anxiety.“This is a global event that touches everyone directly. The heightened level of anxiety means citizens are dependent on getting access to health information, often working at home. That anxiety means people more likely click on something malicious.“We’ve been tracking it closely and you can see several different strands connected in various ways. There are different aims and different technologies.“But what you what you can say is they are all work in a communications ecosystem which, by design, has created an environment almost irresistible to malicious actors try manipulate, confuse and spread disinformation.“Everyone is trying to further their strategic aims, whether it’s by pushing a false narrative, or underneath that using targetted espionage, which is different may be connected by having the same strategic aims.”Paul Barrett, an expert in disinformation and fake news at New York University, has identified similar trends adding that some malicious actors are feeding off each others disinformation for their own ends.“It’s a three ring circus of disinformation,” he told the . “In the current state of affairs it is almost impossible to pick out one strain and isolate it, because simultaneously Russian and China and Trump getting into the act and imitating each other more and more. It is incredibly difficult for an ordinary citizen to navigate what’s true."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a33b1fe7968b1da3cb15afffe22129acc5daf77/0_0_5457_3274/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c8c83e05b4756c2a2822d68b00053c","title":"czech republic opens borders citizens coronavirus infections decline","story":"Repeal of outbound travel ban is sudden U-turn in country among first to close frontiersThe Czech Republic has opened its borders for outbound foreign travel in a sudden U-turn after official figures showed a decline in the rate of Covid-19 infections.The move, announced by the health minister, Adam Vojtěch, represented a surprise change of course for the country, which had been among the first in Europe to close its borders on 16 March.Officials had insisted until recent days that travel restrictions would remain for the foreseeable future, with the country’s president, Miloš Zeman, suggesting last weekend that frontiers should stay closed for the next year. Vojtěch announced the reversal in a press conference on Thursday night but indicated the onus would be on travellers to prove they were uninfected on their return.“Upon return, travellers will either have to present confirmation of a negative test for coronavirus, or be forced to spend 14 days in quarantine,” he said. Commuters would also be able to cross the border daily if they presented a negative test for coronavirus every 14 days, Vojtěch said, a move that will affect a relatively small number of people who live in the Czech Republic but work in a neighbouring country, or vice versa.In a further development, the deputy health minister, Roman Prymula, announced that the mandatory wearing of face masks, credited by officials with containing the virus’s spread, would stay in place until at least the end of June.Restrictions are also being lifted on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 people permitted to gather. Previous rules limited outdoor gatherings to two. There had been growing public pressure for an easing of emergency measures. But there was criticism that the announcement sowed confusion, with no immediate information on when foreign visitors would be allowed to re-enter, which would help Prague’s beleaguered tourism industry.“Has the government opened the borders only for Czech citizens or for foreigners who would like to come to the Czech Republic?” tweeted Jiří Pehe, a political analyst and director of New York University in Prague.The announcement came hours after the government had accelerated its timetable for reopening the economy following pressure from Czech trading lobbies. Restaurants and pubs will be allowed to fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned in a five-phase restart plan announced last week. Zoos will be allowed to reopen from Monday, a full month earlier than planned.The relaxations came after Prague’s municipal court ruled the government’s restrictions unlawful on Thursday.Officials have hailed better-than-expected results from the coronavirus clampdown. The health ministry confirmed the number of infections at 7,188 on Friday, with 55 new Covid-19 positive tests recorded the previous day, the lowest number since 14 March.

Outside the Hullebergmyra nursery in Ullern, west of Oslo, William Bugge was dropping off his children Louise, three, and Jonas, five, after six weeks of quarantine.Yellow smileys painted on the tarmac reminded everyone to keep 2 metres apart. Louise and Jonas were happy to be back, their father even more so: the family went into lockdown barely a day after the parents’ wedding.“It’s been a case of adjusting, to say the least,” said Bugge. “The challenge of working from home and looking after two small children has been immense. But we’re still married.” Several Covid-19 cases at his workplace forced them to isolate early.But as younger children in Norway this week followed some of those in neighbouring Denmark back to kindergarten, not all parents were relieved, despite the assurance of the education minister, Guri Melby, that “going to pre-school is safe”.Those who did return found much had changed: no more toys from home specially installed handwashing facilities outside staggered drop-off and pick-up times no parents in the school building. Once past the gates, children must spend the day in the same small groups of three or six, depending on their age.Pupils at Norway’s primary schools start returning from 27 April as the country, which has recorded nearly 7,500 cases and 194 deaths, reopens after a month of restrictions. Many shops have been allowed to stay open, but bars and most restaurants will remain closed and cultural and sporting events are banned until at least 15 June.At the Hullebergmyra pre-school, Tor Garshol, a teacher, said he had stayed in touch with children and parents online during the lockdown. Online videos produced by the education ministry have taught children what to expect and how to react. “We’ve also provided parents with ideas for activities as well as communicating visually with the children,” he said.Lena Løvik, the headteacher, said that while the children would spend most of their time outdoors, the school’s interior had been ided up into smaller areas and was subject to strict hygiene rules. “We’re loaded up with disinfectants, soap and paper towels,” she said.Surfaces and toys are thoroughly cleaned twice a day, and children taught what to do in terms of personal hygiene and physical distancing. Most seem familiar with the requirements there is even a corner to go and cough. “Our view remains: focus on the children, not the virus,” Løvik said.“It seems most plausible to me that they are being infected but are at low risk of developing disease,” said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We know that for flu, children are important transmitters of infection, which is the basis for the flu vaccination programme directed at children, but we do not know yet how important they are as transmitters of coronavirus. So closing schools would be based on the assumption that they do make an important contribution to transmission.”Rates of various illnesses are seen to rise and fall at the start and end of school terms. School holidays were thought to have led to a plateau in the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Also advised hygiene and social distancing measures, such as hand washing and reduced physical contact, just aren’t very effective in a primary school playground setting. So there is the potential for schools to act as a local fountain of infection for the surrounding area.“Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.This uncertain science has to be carefully weighed against the certain disruption and cost of school closures, including taking large numbers of doctors and nurses out of the workplace, and unintended consequences such as grandparents, who are among the most vulnerable, taking on childcare and facing greater exposure.She said the school community had been through a process of “speed digitalisation”, with online platforms allowing parents, teachers and children to stay connected and continue working. “The extraordinary circumstances have made us all more competent and actually brought us closer together in many ways,” she said.Denmark reopened schools and daycare centres last week after a month-long lockdown, but concerns that they might become breeding grounds for a second wave of cases have convinced many parents to keep their children at home.“I won’t be sending my children off no matter what,” said Sandra Andersen, founder of the Danish “My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig” Facebook group, which has more than 40,000 followers. “A lot of parents are thinking, ‘Why should my little child go outside first’.” The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, defended the reopening for younger children, undertaken on the health authority’s recommendations, saying it would allow parents to return to work and “get the economy going again”.Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University, told Reuters he understood people’s concerns “because we’ve spent a month trying to avoid contact”. But any new infections would not cause problems in an age group “where few fall ill, and those who do won’t get very sick”, he said.Looking at neighbouring Sweden – which has kept its primary and junior schools open – it appeared that children were not major transmitter of the virus, Wejse said.In Denmark, as in Norway, strict rules apply in nurseries, where non-washable toys are banned and a small section assigned to each group of children. Authorities have recommended a floor area of 6sq metres per child for nurseries, 2 metres between tables, and expect staff to supervise regular handwashing and disinfect surfaces such as taps, toilet flushes, tables, and door handles twice a day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aee1ad70da38e04f74ebce29ca4f94a1a309eca/0_85_3174_1905/master/3174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a829ed79f8360e03100549e067dfd74e","title":"officials to investigate potential covid 19 link with liverpool match","story":"Several deaths in city have been blamed on 11 March football game against Atlético MadridPublic health authorities are to investigate a potential link between a Champions League football match in Liverpool and a potential coronavirus rise in the city.The mayor, Joe Anderson, has commissioned the city’s new public health director, Matthew Ashton, to see if there is any connection after a number of deaths were blamed on the 11 March match between Liverpool and Atlético Madrid.The match was attended by 52,000 people, including 3,000 from Madrid, at a time when Spain was already in partial lockdown.Anderson said: “I have asked Matt Ashton and his team to conduct a full investigation into any potential link between that match and the situation with coronavirus in the city.“We want to come to a view as to whether that decision had an impact on the people of this city and I’ve asked Matt to work with the universities to see if the data can give us an indication of that.”Ashton told the  earlier this month the match should not have gone ahead but said bad decisions were not intentional.“Although we will never know, the Atlético Madrid game could have been one of the cultural events and gatherings that influenced the rise in Liverpool. It is definitely one to be included on the list for learning and for a future inquiry, so that organisations can learn and not make similar mistakes.“The Atlético fans were allowed to come into the UK and go to the match when their own stadium was closed to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said.Boris Johnson is facing continued criticism for not acting sooner to ban large public gatherings, including football matches, concerts and the Cheltenham horse racing festival.Gloucestershire Live reported claims that leaked data showed that an area neighbouring Cheltenham racecourse had the highest number of coronavirus hospital admissions in the region earlier this month.Anderson told the Liverpool Echo: “I said at the time that the fact that the Madrid fans were unable to attend matches in their home city but could travel to a game in Liverpool was absurd, but the government and Uefa decided the game should go ahead.“We now want to find out what impact that had in the city.”The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said recently that it was a mistake and “didn’t make any sense” to allow thousands of Atlético fans to attend given the high infection rate in Spain.The latest figures show that 246 people have died from coronavirus in Liverpool’s NHS hospitals.A report on Gloucestershire Live claimed that leaked official data shows the GL52 postcode, which covers areas of north Cheltenham including Pittville, Prestbury and Bishop’s Cleeve, had 27 confirmed hospital admissions of the virus as of 3 April, the highest amount in the county.The data was leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service which noted that Gloucestershire was currently the “most affected county in the least affected region in Great Britain, the south-west, with 989 cases of the virus and 147 deaths in the county as of April 22”.The affected postcode is the one nearest to the racecourse, which is in the centre of the town, and is also one of the more densely populated areas.The government’s deputy chief scientific adviser Angela McLean said recently that it was an “interesting hypothesis” to suggest a link between the two events and local coronavirus infections.More than 250,000 went to the Cheltenham event between 10 March and 13 March and several high-profile attendees have said they believe they contracted coronavirus, including the Duchess of Cornwall’s ex-husband, Andrew Parker Bowles, the comedian Lee Mack, and Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer and husband of News UK’s Rebekah Brooks.The Jockey Club, which organises the event, has rejected suggestions it should have been cancelled and said it had followed public health advice and “went ahead under government guidance”.Scientists say it will be difficult now to get the data to investigate a causal link between the festival and coronavirus cases but population surveys could assist.Andrew Preston, a reader in microbial pathogenesis from the Milner centre for evolution at the University of Bath, said the lack of community testing and tracing meant it may never be possible to know whether Cheltenham contributed to the spread of Covid-19.A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “There are many factors that could influence the number of cases in a particular area, including population density, age and health profile, and the position of an area on the pandemic curve. It is also not possible to make comparisons between hospital trusts across the region as they all serve populations of differing size and characteristics.“The south-west region has seen the lowest number of cases and deaths in the UK and we continue to work hard to support communities during these unprecedented times.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4b19d0544f29ecec4b4db7011fe080f5c242a74/0_493_4133_2481/master/4133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57cf1c8f08844fa79af996b79159b744","title":"royal navy submarine captain investigated over rave barbecue","story":"Film showed sailors dancing in dockyard despite lockdown, after return from patrolThe captain of a nuclear-powered submarine is under investigation after being filmed having a “rave-themed barbecue” in a Plymouth dockyard.Cmdr John Lewis, the captain of HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based at Devonport naval base, has been sent home on leave. He could face dismissal from his role over the incident earlier this month.Footage of the crew showed sailors dancing and laughing, and a source told the BBC some were drinking alcohol.The submarine had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport for repairs. The crew were expected to stay with the submarine in isolation while the repairs were completed.The Royal Navy has placed Lewis under “administrative investigation” over concerns about his judgment.It is alleged that Lewis ignored instructions from his superiors not to approve an impromptu social event when his boat arrived at the naval base.The crew had reportedly been on a mission for several weeks but instead of returning home they were told to remain in quarantine.Footage of the party was first shared on a blog on Forces Compare, an independent search engine to compare insurance quotes. It was subsequently shared among military personnel on other social media sites, including WhatsApp and Facebook.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.A source quoted in the the Times described the party as a “rave in the dockyard” and went on to defend the event.The former naval officer said: “This really comes down to the nature of the order to not do it. If it was ‘you will not’ then that’s one thing. If it was more of a ‘do you think this is a good idea?’ then that’s another. But he’s been in a cramped submarine, just off patrol and they can’t go home. I know where most sympathy is going to lie.”A Royal Navy spokesman said: “An investigation is under way. It would be inappropriate to comment further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afcf923802ff34c7a5c528f2877e618d6f695736/0_196_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3415be1cd27f7e96e2e69c97f747f9c","title":"share your experiences of expanded coronavirus testing in the uk","story":"If you have applied or been offered an appointment we’d like to hear from youAll essential workers in England and their families will be able to book an appointment for a coronavirus test from Friday.We would like to hear from you about your experiences.

Shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open.Polls show many Swedes support and are complying with the policy, which has been heavily criticised by some senior members of the country’s scientific community. The country has also recorded 2,150 deaths – giving it a per-million total much lower than Italy’s and Spain’s, but many times higher than those of its Nordic neighbours.Tegnall said in an interview with Nature magazine that it was “difficult to talk about the scientific basis of a strategy with these types of disease, because we do not know much about it and we are learning as we are doing, day by day”.The epidemiologist added: “Lockdowns, closing of border … Nothing has a historical scientific basis, in my view. We have looked at a number of EU countries to see whether they published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they started, and we saw almost none.”In Germany, Lars Schaade, the vice-president of the country’s infectious diseases agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said citizens “should not lower our guard now”, echoing an earlier warning by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, that the country risked rushing out of lockdown and squandering its achievements so far.Germany, which last week allowed smaller stores, car and bicycle dealers and bookstores to reopen provided they observed strict distancing and hygiene rules, has recorded 150,383 cases and a relatively low death toll of 5,321.But Schaade said he was opposed to any further relaxation until the number of new daily infections fell. “It is a paradox that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very same measures are now being called into question,” he said. “More contact will mean more infections … which, in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.”Meanwhile, media in Italy - whose 25,000 coronavirus deaths represents the second biggest tally in the world after the US – said the government was set to gradually begin easing Europe’s longest and toughest lockdown, in place since 9 March, over the course of the next four weeks.“The next four Mondays will mark the country’s reopening,” the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. The country’s economy would emerge from lockdown at intervals from 27 April, it said, beginning with some factories, followed by clothing and other shops and concluding on 18 May with bars and restaurants.The economy’s gradual reopening would be accompanied by strict hygiene and physical distancing measures, the paper said, with only one customer at a time allowed in shops smaller than 40 sq metres and bars and restaurants obliged to keep a distance of one metre between clients. There was no official confirmation.Spain, which has Europe’s second highest death tally with more than 22,500 fatalities, hailed the fact that for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, more people were now being diagnosed as cured than those falling sick.“With all the effort that we have put in, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,” said Fernando Simón, the health ministry’s emergency centre coordinator. Officials from the country’s 17 regions and central government were to meet later on Friday to discuss easing its six-week lockdown.The Czech Republic unexpectedly opened its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine.Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather compared with a previous limit of two. Restaurants and pubs can fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 – the only sure escape route from the pandemic.Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University’s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.So what is the path to success?Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won’t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly – especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.So it’s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach.The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn’t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or “corona” around the virus.Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists’ creativity in developing this defence.Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week’s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethnical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?First into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside cells, to protein-making factories that sit outside cells.In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London’s team, this week backed by £22.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn’t been tested before in people.“Some groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,” said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. “We don’t have that luxury. It’s probably cost us one or two months, but it’s much better to be cautious and be sure you’ve got something that’s really safe.”Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don’t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as “non-replicating viral vectors”.These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. A third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .“Clearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,” said Joseph Kim, Inovio’s CEO. “But I think it’s just a matter of time.”Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.It’s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.“Some vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,” he said. “And the challenge that we face is that there’s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You’re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.”A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.There is a chance none of them will work.For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.The truth is we’re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.“Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,” according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. “On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.This isn’t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.There are also questions around the type of immunity required.The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.“An ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,” said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. “You need a certain hit rate in the population you’re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,” said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England’s National Infection Service at Porton Down.The possibility of “challenge trials”, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. “There’s a lot of interest in this … because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,” said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial’s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.“We can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,” said Shattock. “Many other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It’s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we’ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.”“If our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well – and that’s still a big if – we could deploy it in the UK this winter,” said Shattock. “All these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.”By September there could be a vaccine – maybe several – that appear broadly safe and effective.That’s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under “emergency use” rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.There are precedents for this – in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.“That might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people’s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,” said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past – recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. “In this case, that would include the fact that if you’re being offered a vaccine in October that didn’t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.”Iniduals could be faced with tough choices – take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.Others urge a unified approach governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. “In global health terms that’s a very big number,” he said. “But if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that’s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that’s a really good investment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1efe095b43d7943291670d7b99ca375b5fd00bd/3_0_5901_3543/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f094e67d588b6c42e832f9e45acc406","title":"coronavirus face masks around the world in pictures","story":"From cut-up T-shirts to bandanas, donning some kind of face covering is becoming the new norm "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236842.1587735740!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new study proves the green credentials of electric vehicles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElectric vehicles in circulation in Europe emit three-times less carbon dioxide on average. Photograph: Sean GallupGettyElectric vehicles (EVs) in circulation in Europe emit three-times less carbon dioxide on average than petrol and diesel cars once the impact of driving, power generation and battery production are factored in.That is the conclusion of the green NGO Transport \u0026amp Environment (T\u0026ampE) in a study which took into account “all possible criteria” to make the comparison, including when electricity is produced or fuel is burnt, as well as raw materials used in making batteries.Critics of EVs contend that when their full carbon footprint is taken into account they deliver negligible emissions savings compared to conventional cars. But T\u0026ampE’s study backs other research showing this is not the case with EVs still emerging as the much greener option even when the full carbon footprint is considered.It has also developed a tool that compiles all the most up-to-date data on CO2 emissions linked to the use of an electric, diesel or petrol cars – including the impact of particular models.“We have taken into account all possible criteria such as the amount of CO2 emitted when electricity is produced or fuel is burnt, as well as the carbon impact of resource extraction for batteries or of building a power plant,” explained T\u0026ampE’s transport and emobility analyst Lucien Mathieu. “We find out that electric cars in Europe emit, on average, almost three times less CO2 than equivalent petroldiesel cars.”In the worst case scenario, an electric car with a battery produced in China and driven in Poland still emits 22 per cent less CO2 than diesel and 28 per cent less than petrol. “And in the best case scenario, an electric car with a battery produced in Sweden and driven in Sweden can emit 80 per cent less CO2 than diesel, and 81 per cent less than petrol.”“We also see that electric cars will reduce CO2 emissions four-fold by 2030 thanks to an EU grid relying more and more on renewables,” he added.“This tool puts to rest the myth that driving an electric car in Europe can be worse for the climate than an equivalent diesel or petrol. It’s simply not true,” Mr Mathieu said. “If European governments are serious about decarbonising during the crisis recovery, they must speed up the transition to EVs.”The tool will be updated as new data is available, he confirmed.

Photograph: LivelineA 47-year-old man who contracted coronavirus and whose family was told he only had 24 hours to live has recovered from the illness and his medical records will now be used for research to help treat the virus worldwide.Mark Burke, from Co Wicklow, was in ICU in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, for four weeks. He developed a problem with his bowels, his lungs were failing, and medics believed he would not survive. His family were told to say goodbye to him.Mr Burke’s wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him while he was in ICU.“When the kids walked in, he opened his eyes he heard their voices. If you saw it in a movie, you wouldn’t believe it. You would think that it is so far fetched. He’s in a coma, he’s not coming out of it. He was in double organ failure, his lungs had failed him, his bowels had failed him, but when he heard his children, he opened his eyes and the nurses were witness to that.”Mr Burke’s family returned home and awaited a call from the hospital to update them on his condition.However, the father of four who had no underlying medical condition survived the next 24 hours, and medics began to provide him with various medications in a bid to improve his bowels to the point where they could operate on him.“They said he had a 5 per cent chance of regenerating enough of the bowel to stabilise him enough for the operating theatre. And it did happen,” Ms Burke said.“On the following Wednesday, they decided right he’s lasted Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - four days - and he didn’t deteriorate. He didn’t improve, but he didn’t deteriorate. That was shocking them.“They kept saying why is he not going into multi-organ failure”, why is he still with us? They couldn’t understand it. They said right, we’ve secured him enough, we’ve stabilised him enough. We were absolutely thrilled. We’re just so overjoyed with the outcome.”Mr Burke underwent surgery, made a full recovery and is now back at home with his family.Mr Burke said he “can’t imagine” what it was like for his family.“I don’t know how they did it. I personally think if I was in Joanne’s shoes, I would have caved,” he said. “I’m doing good. I’m in recovery mode. From my perspective, what they did for me in ICU is absolutely out of this world.”He added that his medical records are being released to “every medical board across the world” for research purposes.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236927.1587728477!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"not practical for everyone to walk to work says independent td","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: ‘We need to look at practical measures.’ Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyThe Green Party’s demand for a slashing of Ireland’s carbon emissions is unachievable and talk about everyone walking to work is not practical, a prominent Independent TD has said. Denis Naughten, who is the convenor of the Regional Group of non-party deputies, was speaking after the Greens published a list of 17 demands the party wants addressed before considering a coalition government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Mr Naughten said there is a need to stop “shadow boxing” and to move on to proper negotiations for a programme for government. Any coalition government between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and one of the smaller parties may also require the support of a number of independents Mr Naughten, who is a TD for the Roscommon-Galway constituency, warned the Green proposals were not possible and that it was not practical to have everyone to walk to work to help reach the Green Party targets. “We need to look at practical measures,” Mr Naughten said. According to the TD, the best way for creation of a stable government is to have the two main parties along with a third smaller party and then the eight independent TDs.“That’s our preference. The reality is we need a government urgently to make decisions that need to be made in the next couple of weeks.“It is imperative that we have a government in place to take best decisions in the interest of the country,” he said.Mr Naughten said the document from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael was “quite helpful” and that “within a fortnight” there could be a programme for government. However, the difficulty was who would be sitting around the table.“To talk about and give listeners an idea of the type of figures we’re talking about here – if we banned every single private car in the country and everyone walked to work every single day, we’d reach that target for 14 months of the next five years. “If we slaughtered every single animal in this country we would still not achieve the five-year target that the Greens are setting out here – that’s the type of scale that they’re talking about and it is not possible to do that in a very short period of time, and we need to look practically at the type of measures and changes that need to take place, and absolutely there has to be a very different economy now, there’s no doubt about that, and there’s huge opportunities for people to work from home and reduce significantly their transport emissions, but it’s not practical to talk about everyone walking to work.”Green’s red lines Meanwhile, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said addressing the climate and bioersity crisis “is a red line” for his party to enter formal coalition negotiations with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, he said it would require setting “a scale and level of ambition” to cut back on pollution levels and doing that in a way that delivers the “just transition”.“So in terms of that broad biggest project that we think needs to be taken on, is absolutely a broad red line,” he said.But Mr Ryan said clarity is required to know the next government is going to change Ireland towards a “greener” country and that scientific advice is heeded.Separate to tackling climate change, he said, the two other main aims would be the development of public housing and conversion to a public universal health system.The Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil document was “aspirational”, but that was not a bad thing as it sets out a broad outline, he said.Mr Ryan said for any parties going into government, it takes a couple of weeks to go through the full range of issues.If Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are going to shift the nature of the economy towards public housing and public health they would need to be specific about how they are going to do that, Mr Ryan said. The Green Party leader said rather than invest heavily in new road projects, he was calling for more investment in infrastructure for cycling and walking.In the current crisis more people are working from home and some of that should be continued when the country returns to normal, as it would alleviate some of the congestion on our roads, he added.Mr Ryan also said he was confident any new government would follow through on the Climate Action plan.“I would expect any new government to introduce that within the first 100 days. I take that as a given, and I think the other parties have agreed that. I don’t see any problem introducing that. The question is what is the scale of ambition of change.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236460.1587673724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu members expect weeks of talks on budget and recovery plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel after the video-conferenced EU summit. Photograph: Olivier HosletReutersWeeks of further talks are expected to try to bridge differences among European Union member states over how to fund the bloc’s budget and a recovery plan to counter the deep economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The 27 leaders of the EU did not put out a joint statement after meeting over video conference on Thursday, which diplomats blamed on both the difficulty of the format of being unable to meet in person, and the extent of isions between the governments.They rubber-stamped a prior agreement by finance ministers to allow member states to seek support from the EU’s bailout fund, and for a package of loans to be made available for businesses from June.\u0026nbspBut the most contentious matter of how to pay for a recovery fund and what form it should take was given over to the technical experts of the European Commission for detailed development.\u0026nbspThere was broad agreement that the recovery plan should be linked to the bloc’s budget, and Germany signalled it was willing to increase its funding to give it more firepower to combat the slump.The heads of the European institutions said a large increase was required to fight a downturn “unprecedented in modern times”. “We are not talking billion, we are talking trillion,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. She noted that the economic damage of the pandemic would not be evenly felt across the EU, and warned that unless strong action was taken it would increase economic imbalances between weaker and stronger economies in the union.National priorities But several countries warned their approval would depend on how the contentious details are worked out. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had argued for “urgent financial support for farmers”. This reflects Ireland’s long-held position of protecting EU farming payments in budget talks, and is just one example of how national priorities will need to be balanced in order to agree a coronavirus recovery plan if it is linked to the EU budget.There is a broader philosophical difference over funding between members, and it breaks down roughly into two camps. The “frugal” states, including the Netherlands and Sweden, resist paying extra into the EU budget. They oppose taking on shared debt to fund the recovery, and believe that assistance to struggling states should be in the form of loans that must be paid back.The other side of the argument is represented by states such as Italy and Spain. They have called for swift and dramatic action to counter the deep impact of the pandemic, which has worsened the precarious state of weaker economies, and have called for assistance in the form of grants rather than loans that would further increase their debt.Ahead of the conference, nervousness on financial markets had pushed up the cost of borrowing for Italy, leading to concerns that urgent action was needed to prevent deepening of its financial trouble.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said work would continue but for now enough had already been agreed by finance ministers to avoid “acute financial problems”.But Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said help should come in the form of grants – and quickly. “Europe must not once again do too little, too late,” he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Captain Tom Moore - share your thanks and birthday wishesDonald Trump\u0026#39s scientific illiteracy rapidly moving from risible to lethalGovernment website runs out of coronavirus home testing kits within two minutesUK coronavirus lockdown: what are the rules, and when will it be lifted?How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

They are just excited to see their friends - even if playing with each other again comes with a whole new set of rules.Standing in the playground of Logumkloster School, in the south of the country, 10-year-old Zakarias Al-Tibi complained: “We usually jump and hug and fight and give each other high fives. But we can’t do that anymore.”When Denmark’s nurseries and primary schools were given permission to re-open on April 15, with over-12s remaining at home for now, it came with a list of government instructions designed to minimise the risk of children spreading the virus amongst each other.Class sizes have been cut by half and the children must wash their hands as soon as they arrive, and every two hours after, play outside in small groups and sit at desks and tables at least two-metres apart.At the same time they are not allowed to bring toys from home and the nurseries or school’s own toys and equipment has to be disinfected twice a day, along with surfaces such as sinks, toilet seats and door handles.Parents are asked to drop their children off at the front gates in a staggered system and cannot themselves enter buildings, leaving any change of clothes that might be needed outside. All this is putting a strain on the teachers who are required to make sure their charges follow the rules.“Every time you look around, the kids are touching each other,” said one teacher. “How many times can you tell them off for that?”Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe - after Italy - to impose a strict lockdown and its relaxation of restrictions came after the number of new daily infections began to fall from a high of 390 on April 6.Understandably there has been some anxiety among parents being asked to take part in this experiment.One mother of two, Sandra Andersen, drew 40,000 followers after setting up a Facebook group called ‘My kid is not going to be a Guinea Pig’. But after a fews days it appeared that by issuing clear instructions for children and adults to follow the authorities had won over the trust of most parents and attendance rates are back to 90 per cent in many schools.Responding to a survey by Denmark’s English language newspaper The Local, a parent named Maria wrote: “The video provided for the kids by the health authorities was a very good and positive way of explaining how things will be different, but fun and safe.But she confessed to mixed emotions at waving goodbye to her 6-year-old at the school gates, after weeks spent social distancing at home.My girl has been happy about the idea of being with her friends wrote Maria. We adults feel that this is a step we need to do, but not without concern and contradictory feelings. “After being so careful about distances, isolation, cleaning, and avoiding others, it feels a big step to \u0027get out\u0027 again. Schools are not the only places to be given the green light for a return to an altered form of normality.In a move which Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as “walking a tightrope”, hairdressers were given permission to reopen on Monday, alongside beauty salons, tattoo parlours (see picture below) and spa clinics. Sports not involving contact, such as golf and tennis, were allowed from Tuesday.The result was predictable enough in a country where people have been kept indoors for over five weeks.

They are working long hours every day.”Here too there are strict social distancing and hygiene guidelines to follow.Like many of Denmark’s parents Ms Mikkelsen is putting her faith in the ability of the country’s authorities to negotiate a way out of the lock down without inviting a second deadly wave of COVID-19 cases.“If you obey the rules, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s dangerous,” she said. “I\u0027m sure they wouldn\u0027t have given us permission to open up if it was dangerous.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public searching way lockdown google data shows","story":"More people are now searching for how long the lockdown will last, rather than how long coronavirus itself will last, in a sign that people\u0027s patience with stringent social distancing policies is beginning to falter.The UK-wide lockdown was introduced on 23 March. It was a popular policy among the public, polling showed, with many recognising its effectiveness in \u0027flattening the curve\u0027 of the epidemic. The vast majority have adhered to the lockdown\u0027s rules. But now, people\u0027s searching habits may reveal that the public\u0027s patience is beginning to waver, with the Government offering no end in sight to the lockdown. Searches for when pubs, restaurants, shops and schools will re-open have all increased over the last week. Most people are concerned about when schools will re-open in the UK, according to the figures. This peaked on Sunday 19 April, after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said I can\u0027t give you a date when schools will reopen.But people are also increasingly looking for a date on which they can re-enter social venues such as pubs and shops.Searches for symptoms peaked in the UK on the 16 and 17 March, over a week before the lockdown was imposed. At this point, cases were rising exponentially in the UK. Since the lockdown came into place, the number of cases of coronavirus has flattened. The R value - the rate at which the disease spreads - is now said to be below one in the community, meaning that each infected person is, on average, spreading it to less than one person. This seems to have led to people being less worried about themselves having the disease, with fewer numbers looking to self-diagnose themselves of symptoms on Google.Now, this behaviour has been usurped by search interest in the lockdown itself, with an increase in people looking for an end to at least some of the measures.This interest for the word lockdown peaked on 23 March, the day the measures were initially imposed, but still remains as a quarter of this level a full month after the restrictions were put in place.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine crew had lockdown party","story":"A Royal Navy nuclear submarine captain, under investigation for allowing a quarantine barbeque to go ahead, would usually have just received a \u0027slap on the wrist\u0027, the  understands.  An investigation is under way after reports that the commander threw a party for his crew despite social distancing guidelines.Social media footage has emerged of the crew of HMS Trenchant enjoying the barbecue and party in violation of lockdown rules after docking for repairs in Devonport base, Plymouth.The Trafalgar-class attack submarine had been at sea for months and was due to return on patrol after a short maintenance period.Ordinarily, such an incident would have merited a low level disciplinary sanction such as a stern word from a senior officer a so-called slap on the wrist - known throughout the military as an \u0027interview without coffee\u0027. However, the more serious measure of launching a formal investigation has been taken as this is thought not to be the first time the judgement of the commanding officer has been called into question by senior navy figures. HMS Trenchant\u0027s commanding officer has been sent home on leave whilst the investigation takes place.Admiral Lord West of Spithead, the former head of the Royal Navy, said: “These guys have been locked up in a boat for a very long time and are suddenly told they’re not allowed to go anywhere because they’re needed to go back to sea again, so they can’t go home to see their loved ones.“If I had been the captain I would have let them let their hair down but I wouldn’t have asked anyone, I would have just done it.“I wouldn’t have asked the MoD I would have just said ‘right lads, we’re going to have a few beers’ and just done that.Having returned from a patrol thought to be of some weeks duration, the nuclear-powered boat and her crew were considered \u0027clean\u0027 and are being held in quarantine whilst the routine maintenance is conducted.Having been living in close proximity to each other for weeks at a time, the  understands the issue is less that the crew risked becoming infected with coronavirus, but more that senior Royal Navy commanders thought the decision to allow sailors to party during lockdown was inappropriate given the hardships endured by the British public.A Royal Navy spokesman said: An investigation is underway.

A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, gave a television interview suggesting 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a mitigation strategy could result in 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty – and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:In the first graphs shown by Mr Johnson in March, squashing the sombrero would cause the first peak to come towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Under that scenario, the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly, it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave the Government was so keen to avoid. Although experts believe we have now peaked in the first wave, that is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said: There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.One of the problems of Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent. On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying with the lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent, and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating than was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life showed that, in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that the amount would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine, and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with Government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to a noticeable downturn in cases in the past week, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper, published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce-back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be, in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity, the researchers warned.Experts on the Government\u0027s Sage committee now believe that only about five per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is almost no herd immunity in Britain.Under the Government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction, or R number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below one and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The Government is carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease and work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent, and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of people in France will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of the high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Karol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. We\u0027re nowhere near herd immunity, he said. We could definitely have a second peak. It is a real worry.Imperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available in order to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially, leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means restrictions such as social distancing will be in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage group and the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the virus would not be going away any time soon and future waves were likely.We must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one-off episode, he said. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We\u0027re going to have to find ways to deal with that.The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the Government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale hospitals while cases are on the decline.The possibility of a second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale hospitals, and some are still being built.Fears of a second coronavirus wave have made governments around the world nervous about lifting their lockdowns too early and too quickly, and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure cases are not allowed to rise, while squashing the sombrero of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London said: A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services and meet all healthcare worker needs. Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions.In the north-eastern city of Harbin, a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing, there has been a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: There\u0027s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/20/14/20317448-high-res-the-big-night-in-with-children-in-need-and-comic-relief.jpg","title":"bbc big night in live stream channel best bits peter kay little britain catch up watch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.As it happened EndedLenny Henry, Catherine Tate and many more famous faces starred in the fundraiserAs the BBC\u0027s live entertainment offering for lockdown, The Big Night In, drew to a close on Thursday night, it had already raised an incredible £27m for charity.The event\u0026nbspsaw\u0026nbspComic Relief and Children in Need team up for an evening starring many famous faces, from Lenny Henry\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspCatherine Tate\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspMatt Lucas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Walliams.Check out the biggest talking points, below...Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrince William tried his hand at comedyJust when you thought lockdown couldn’t get any weirder, the future King of England Zoomed Stephen Fry, cracking jokes about not wearing any trousers and why he didn’t watch Tiger King. It’s because he “tends to avoid shows about royalty”, by the way. Fry, who has more of a knack for comedy,\u0026nbspwas portraying his Blackadder character Lord Melchett – the personal advisor to Queen Elizabeth I.Little Britain’s TV return stuns viewers with shock ‘bat-eating’ jokePeter Kay has appeared on TV for the first time in two yearsPrince William jokes he hasn’t seen Tiger King during Big Night InSteve Coogan and Rob Brydon served up a lockdown special of The TripThis was one of the highlights of the night, and it felt pretty effortless. The pair just chatted away, whining about being roped into another Comic Relief gig: It would be a relief if Richard Curtis stopped calling. And instead of opting for the obligatory bookshelf backdrops we so often see on Zoom, Brydon’s shelves were stacked with family photographs. Coogan\u0027s were filled with his awards, of course.Peter Kay and Dawn French reminded us of the power of nostalgia In an evening that still felt melancholy despite the large amount of laughs, two particular moments of comedy served as healthy respites: Peter Kay, himself a veritable man of mystery nowadays, expressing gratitude for the response to his 2005 charity rendition of Tony Christie’s “Amarillo”. Seeing such mid-Noughties joy all over again was so heartwarming that you managed to forget most of those involved in it are now dead. French’s Vicar of Dibley return was similarly moving. In the same vein, such a warm hug of a throwback almost managed to block out the fact that half the show’s cast is dead now, too.Matt Lucas and David Walliams deserve kudos for their improvised reunion (the toilet paper holders for wigs was a great shout) – but yeesh was this a reminder of how terribly Little Britain has aged. The wacky accents, racist innuendos and class stereotypes were guiltily funny back in the show’s heyday, when we were all a little bit more ignorant, but it felt beamed from an entirely different universe in 2020.Even the most talented of pop stars can’t survive an echo-y living roomWhile it’s slightly mean to criticise the litany of pop stars participating in a good cause, few of the night’s live singers could escape the horror of an echo-y living room. Everyone from Nicole Scherzinger to Jess Glynne and Celeste to Sam Smith struggled valiantly to combat the limitations of their improvised surroundings, to miserable returns. For anyone hoping that house-bound concerts could replace the real thing, either during or after this pandemic, The Big Night In reminded us all that they can’t.The live blog is now closed.Find out everything you need to know about The Big Night In here, including how to donate to the fundraiser to support vulnerable people of all ages and backgrounds across the UK who will be significantly impacted by the crisis.Children in Need\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOne World: Together at Home\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It produced a number of films, including Father of the Bride (1991) and Fly Away Home (1996), as well as several Parton projects – most recently her Netflix anthology series Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt also produced the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie, released in 1992 to dismal reviews. It was Gail Berman, then an executive at Sandollar, who still believed there was potential in the property, and proposed launching the concept as a TV series.Both Berman and Gallin are credited as executive producers on the Buffy series, along with its spin-off series Angel, though Parton herself is not. She did, however, play a fundamental if often forgotten role in bringing Joss Whedon’s creation to the screen.How Normal People captures the angst of young romanceBBC’s Big Night In – a joy marred by Little Britain’s racist returnSopranos fans are only just discovering Lady Gaga was in an episodeWhile it has never been confirmed, some have suggested that Buffy Summers’ on-screen birthday (19 January) is a secret tribute to Parton – the country star herself being born on the same day.The resurfaced news of Parton’s uncredited involvement in Buffy has sparked shock among fans.“I was today years old when I found out that Dolly Parton was an uncredited executive producer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” wrote one person on Twitter.Another added: “There’s no emoji for the look on my face.”Running from 1997 until 2003, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar as a young woman tasked with protecting the world from vampires and demons.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will be back up and running when the next batch of slots are available for each given day.”Mr Hancock said earlier on Friday morning that the scheme would start in “small numbers”, but he was “carefully” watching to ensure the website could handle the expected online traffic.The cabinet minister also said the home test kits would be collected by a courier and taken to a lab to prevent people having to travel long distances, with results available within 24 hours in most cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

One participant was given a dose of the vaccine, while the other was given a meningitis vaccine for comparison.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Gilbert said the team was looking to recruit hospital workers “who will be at greater risk of infection” in order to increase the chances of gauging the vaccine’s efficacy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe said they were “not convinced” that Covid-19 is still prevalent enough in the UK for the trial to produce results as quickly as they would like.“We’ve been accelerating the trial as much as we possibly can and we’re looking to, for the next phase of the trial, specifically recruit people who work in hospitals who will be at greater risk of infection, because while there are still cases in hospital, that’s where the virus is,” she said.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“We’re going to try and increase our chances of getting the vaccine efficacy result by doing that. But we accept that we may not be able to do that in this country, so we’re also making plans to set up trials in other countries where the transmission of the virus has been a bit slower to get going because we may need to go and test the vaccine somewhere else.”Researchers need to test the actual vaccine against a placebo in large enough groups of people in order to determine its effectiveness. They are testing for three things: the vaccine’s safety, its ability to induce immune responses, and its efficacy in stopping people from contracting the coronavirus.According to Prof Gilbert, the team are aiming to have at least 5,000 people take part in the trials.However, the fall in the rate of infections could potentially delay the production of the vaccine. The Oxford team had hopes of at least a million doses of its candidate being ready in September.“It could still happen over the summer and maybe we will get a signal of efficacy, a trend towards efficacy, a hint that it’s working here, and then be able to add to that by doing trials in other countries.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this moment we don’t have a treatment for coronavirus so we would have to do this extremely carefully.”On Thursday, Prof Gilbert said she was “very optimistic” that the vaccine developed by her team will be successful, but she added that there was “absolutely no suggestion” the vaccine would become available to the general population before its efficacy was determined.The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the testing process with six more volunteers on Saturday, and will move to larger numbers on Monday.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But a new study suggests that such visitors might have been alongside us all along.The researchers suggest that the objects came from other stars, billions of years ago, and have been orbiting around our Sun undiscovered ever since.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe objects were first pulled out of another\u0026nbspsolar system in the relatively early days of the universe, when the stars were closer together and so upset each other\u0027s gravity more easily.\u0026nbspThis enabled asteroids to be pulled from one star system to another, said Fathi Namouni, lead author of the study, in a statement.Just as with those other visitors, researchers hope they can use the objects to understand the differences between objects that have spent all of their time in our solar system and\u0026nbspthose alien visitors.“The discovery of a whole population of asteroids of interstellar origin is an important step in understanding the physical and chemical similarities and differences between solar system-born and interstellar asteroids,” commented Dr.\u0026nbspMorais.The researchers came upon the discovery after running computer simulations that allowed them to look at how the solar system may have looked in its earliest days. When they looked the asteroids in question, they found they were orbiting the Sun in a distant region beyond the disc of gas and dust that would form the rest of the asteroids, and along a different orbit to the other planets and asteroids.That strange placement led the researchers to speculate that the asteroids were not native at all but had actually been plucked out of interstellar space as the planets were forming.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the heirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citi bank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimate that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs set up by London’s boroughs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week. I start at their Park Royal depot, drive to Hello Fresh in Banbury and to Mindful Chef near Birmingham, returning with a two-ton\u0026nbsppayload. Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell. To think some parents have to choose between paying rent and feeding their children and that Felix is the only reason they can do both — it brings a lump to your throat.”Retired facilities manager for City officesRuns a fundraising\u0026nbspconsultancy for charities“I came across Felix when it launched in 2016 and was hired to help them raise funds. I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked. I started doing one day a week but since coronavirus, I have been doing two full days as a co-driver. It’s hard physical work but it never fails to put a smile on my face. Since lockdown, my partner Rob drives me and today we were on the road for four hours delivering 16 crates of food to six charities and each time we were made to feel like Father Christmas.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of our churches across the capital, particularly those that host and run food banks and homeless shelters, have successfully partnered with Felix in the past. Never has there been a greater need for us all to come together to support the vulnerable in our local communities.”Imam Mahmoud, who ran a half marathon to support Felix in 2017, said: “I applaud the good work that The Independent and The Felix Project are doing to feed and support the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community during this time of crisis. In difficult times, it is important that we all come together regardless of background and support each other as a community and as a nation, the best we can.”With the start of Ramadan today, Imam Mahmoud added that he was particularly “moved by the good spirit” that people have shown towards others of late. “This project is close to my heart because I’ve seen first-hand the benefit that it has bought to the community. I urge everyone to continue to support Food for London Now and other projects like it.”Rabbi Mirvis called for a sense of community at a time when many feel isolated. He said: “The great Jewish sages taught that ‘anyone who saves a single life is considered to have saved the whole world’. In these extraordinary times, it is not only the heroes of the NHS who are called upon to fulfil this noblest aspiration. The efforts of The Independent and The Felix Project, together with their partners, make it possible for us all to play our part in saving the lives of the most vulnerable among us.“Today, as many thousands of people face the agonising uncertainty of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, we must reach out to them with compassion and reassurance. I urge everyone who is able to support the appeal.”How to support our campaignThe Independent\u0027s appeal, in association with our sister newspaper The Evening Standard, was set up to fund The Felix Project, London’s biggest surplus food distributor, to provide for the delivery of food to the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies, or are stuck at home at risk of losing their lives. Felix currently delivers the equivalent of 100,000 meals a day to giant community hubs run by local authorities as well as charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Northern Powerhouse Rail have asked government for £25 million to get on with working up the outline scheme that they want to do, Sir John told the Commons transport select committee.Those are the sort of thing that the government can do to get things moving because in the first place it\u0027s not about digging holes, it\u0027s actually about doing lots of environmental work assessments, design, consultation, land acquisition. There\u0027s several years of work that will take place on Northern Powerhouse Rail before you can start digging holes.The scheme is backed by northern cities and will share some infrastructure with HS2, the north-south high speed railway whose construction was green-lit by the government last week.Sir John said the best way the government could ensure there was capacity to build multiple schemes at one was to give more certainty to its long-term plans and long-term strategy so that contractors would feel able to invest long-term in their capabilities.The chair of the Commission, which is conducting a review into phase two of HS2 past Birmingham into Manchester and Leeds, said the construction of new lines was a good idea.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s called High Speed 2 but frankly it\u0027s more capacity to the north. Rail will continue to grow, the demand is there.He warned critics of the project that it was difficult to accurately draw up an economic business case for the project as it would involve predicting the future.We\u0027re talking about a project that is going to be beneficial to the country for the next 75 years at least and forecasting how those long-term socioeconomic benefits will play out is difficult enough for anyone. I think occasionally you need to say \u0027this looks a sensible thing to do, so let\u0027s go ahead\u0027, he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, some 80 kilometres south of SydneyAn activist performs on the roof during Earth Day in Wroclaw, PolandMalaysian army personnel set up barbed wire in the locked down area of Selayang wholesale market in Kuala LumpurA trader walks inside a pen as he arrives to purchase vegetables and fruits at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee market in Navi Mumbai during the nationwide lockdownA bride, poses for a wedding photographer next to East Lake in WuhanPeople shout at police officers during a demonstration of conspiracy theorists as other demonstrators protest against the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus in BerlinA pair of rare morepork owl chicks have become the first in more than a decade to survive on Norfolk Island, in the South PacificA squirrel runs across a fence as the sun shines in Berlin\u0027s Kreuzberg districtElection officials count after general election voting in Seoul, South KoreaNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was damaged in a devastating fire one year ago todayWild bluebells, which bloom around mid-April turning the forest blue as they form a carpet, pictured in the Hallerbos in BelgiumPope Francis delivers his Urbi et Orbi message following Easter Sunday Mass behind closed doors at St Peter\u0027s Basilica in The Vatican, during the country\u0027s lockdownA man watches Krakatau spewing ash during an eruption, in Serang, Indonesia\u0027s Banten provinceWomen queue for distribution of food for those suffering under Kenya\u0027s coronavirus-related movement restrictionsFirefighter Sittiporn Singthong, dressed up as Spider-Man, sprays disinfectant at the Wat Tha Mai Buddhist temple in Samut Sakhon province, ThailandTulip fields in Plomeur, western FranceA employee and a resident of the house for the elderly De Ravenstein react as nurses dance and sing in the garden, following the coronavirus disease outbreak, in Boortmeerbeek, BelgiumA man stands in the balcony of his home with the moon in the background in Cali, ColombiaA man holds a traditional lamp from the balcony of his house as torches and candles illuminate houses and high rise residential buildings as Indians mark the country\u0027s fight against the coronavirus pandemic a suburb of New Delhi, IndiaMedical staff load an infected patient into an ambulance at the Nimes air base, south of France, during an evacuation operation from the hard-hit east of the country where hospitals are overwhelmedA man prays inside the closed Moussawi Grand Mosque in BasraA City Hall health official wearing a protective suit sprays disinfectant at the entrance of City One condominium as the residential building was placed under lockdown after 17 cases of COVID-19 were detected, in Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaMigrant workers wait on marked areas on the ground to maintain social distancing as they queue to receive food packets at an industrial area during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown as a preventive measure against the Covid-19 coronavirus, in ChennaiWedding dress and evening wear designer Friederike Jorzig adjusts a mannequin wearing a wedding dress with matching protective mask in her store Chiton in BerlinA stray dog walks in front of an empty historic India Gate, as nationwide lockdown continues over the coronavirus in New Delhi, IndiaA man watches a TV screen showing a file image of North Korea\u0027s missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in SeoulHong Kong\u0027s skyline is seen with some of its lights turned off to mark the Earth Hour, an environmental campaignUkrainian citizens queue at the Polish-Ukrainian border during the coronavirus pandemic in Korczowa, Poland.

Exam boards will not be issuing any papers or tests at all.The government is using a mix of student performance criteria that include teacher assessments, mock exam grades and overviews of a pupils general work.The government guidelines say: The calculated grades awarded will be formal grades, with the same status as grades awarded in any other year.University representatives expect universities to be flexible and do all they can to support students and ensure they can progress to higher education.There is a lot of worry over how that will play out in practice, particularly for underprivileged students or kids who just didnt take the mock exams as seriously as the real deal.If a student does not believe the correct process has been followed in their case they will be able to appeal on that basis.In addition,they do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance, they will have the opportunity to sit an exam, as soon as is reasonably possible after schools and colleges open again.Students will also have the option to sit their exams in summer .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown.

Do they really think that is the priority right now The Sussexes - from their Los Angeles bolthole - issued the tetchy statement saying they would no longer deal with The Sun and Britain’s other tabloid newspapers.It was reported on the front page of the republican sympathisingnewspaper.s story mentioned that the Sussexes were thought to be “angered” by a Sun exclusive that they were relocating to North America.That story was, of course, true.I fear Harry has already soaked up too much of the Hollywood “me, me, me” culture.He and Meghan appear to want to shape their media profile by press release and their own social media channels.That way they believe the coverage will be more glowing.It’s how celebrities try and control their public image.But I think British public will see through all that.I suggest the Sussexes time right now might be better spent writing letters to NHS workers and people who have lost loved ones to this awful virus.Or sending letters of comfort to those confined to their homes or the soldiers who have been helping Nightingale Hospitals across the country rather than whining about the media.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.If they need to see how it should be done they only need to look at the way the Queen, Charles and Camilla and William and Catherine have gone about things.They’ve shown resilience and leadership in these dark times.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health - with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too - though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stan can’t do it.Nobody will ever love you like a dog.Nobody will ever be as happy to see you as a dog.Nobody will ever make you laugh as much as a dog.In their heartbreakingly brief lives they make you realise how lucky you are to be alive.I would recommend getting a dog to anyone.Watching your child grow up with a dog is a privilege and a joy.But our dogs rely on us as much as we rely on them.And a dog is for ever, not just for lockdown.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back. Dawn French will reprise her role as the Rev Geraldine Granger for the BBC’s Big Night In this evening.That should cheer us up for a few moments.Here are a few more sitcoms they could update to keep us laughing through the lockdown:Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em – Frank Spencer is appointed Health Secretary and has to give briefings every day to the Press. Ooh, Betty, the hilarity.Till Death Us Do Part – Alf Garnett, in self isolation, kindly explains to us what he thinks of some Chinese culinary practices and the Chinese government.Both Feet In The Grave – sadly, there was no ventilator for Victor.Not Going Out – huge laughs as a large number of people don’t, er, go out.Are You Being Served  – um . . .  no, actually.Dad’s Army – Captain Mainwaring orders his men to build a new hospital in two days flat, with hilarious consequences.On The Buses – Stan and Jack vow to wreak revenge on the idiots who won’t give them PPE.How’s the home- schooling coming along then Got the kids up at eight every morning to do a bit of calculus I’ve been enjoying it, although I maybe haven’t given enough attention to mathematics.But it’s been a good chance to redress some of the crap my daughter has been subjected to in ten years of state education.She now has a slightly dferent take on the British Empire, the poverty of Africa and how fun it might be to transition into being a bloke.A mad woman in America has warned that home-schooling is “dangerous”. Why Professor of Law Elizabeth Bartholet said: “It’s always dangerous to put powerful people in charge of the powerless.”.She added that it gave parents “authoritarian control” over the kids.You mean like the authoritarian control they’ve had from the teachers all these years, love It’s comforting to know that even in this crisis, the liberals are still as deranged as ever.You’ve got to feel sorry for Victoria Beckham, haven’t you Poor woman says that last week was the worst of her le.She’s bitterly disappointed with you, the British people.She thinks we were all terribly arsey about her when she decided to use our money to furlough her fashion company workers.How could we be so mean as to expect a woman who has an estimated wealth of £million – acquired largely through singing badly – should dig into her own pockets.Rather than scrounging off the taxpayer.The stinking rich really don’t get it, do they No self awareness whatsoever – and even less shame.But then never mind the witless Posh, whose useless company loses millions every year.Look at old beardo Branson – Sir Richard, entrepreneur and “philanthropist”.He wants YOU to pay HIM £million to bail out his airline, Virgin.This is a man who has paid not a single penny of income tax in the UK for fourteen years.But when his company is in trouble he expects you to bail him out.And this from a bloke who has already been coining it from the taxpayer for his awful rail franchises.This kind of bare-faced cheek almost beggars belief.Or there’s Apple boss Tim Cook boasting about sending a few safety masks to the UK.SO kind of you, Tim.Now how about your company pays its proper share of tax in the UK  Then we might not need your charity.Pope Francis has pleaded with the EU for countries to “come together” to fight the virus.Ha. Fat chance, your Popeship.The European Union is falling apart as a consequence of this crisis.All the member states have been doing the sensible thing – and ignoring everything the EU bureaucrats have to say.Germany introduced very tough anti-immigration measures, for example.But the EU has been criticised for abandon- ing Spain and Italy.There are big rows over a joint debt fund to help the worst-hit countries.There are arguments over what phone app should be used to track virus carriers.One leading European economist said that the EU was in danger of “imploding”.Ah well – every cloud, huh I CAN’T get to my usual snippers in Saltburn. So my we and daughter kindly agreed to cut my hair for me. They gave me a kind of Mohican.I think it’s great. The new me. Liddle, back in the game. Watch out, chicks.KIM JONG-UN is apparently very ill.

after Government scientists said last night that social distancing could continue until .In a press conference this lunchtime she said that ato normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future.But she wanted to be frank with you every step of the way and encouraged the public to engage in her plans to ease ruled and restrictions in the coming weeks.She told the nation that the lockdown was working but it was also doing long-term damage.It was causing harm to the economy, living standards, to children’s education, to aspects of our physical health and metal health and wellbeing.Her proposed plan for relaxing the lockdown included:Ms Sturgeon stressed the strict measures were still absolutely necessary, but said Scotland needs to chart a way forward to live with the virus over the coming months.What we must do is find a new normal, a way of living alongside this virus but in a form that keeps it under control and stops it taking the toll we know it can do, she said.The First Minister also said that the reproduction rate of the virus must be kept below one, with best estimates putting the figures somewhere between . and one.Some measures could be lted but others could be made tougher, she suggested, like Dominic Raab has previously suggested.And any lockdown could come back at any point - possibly with short notice, she warned.We want to ease restrictions but must be prepared for them to be reimposed as well as lted, Ms Sturgeon said.Echoing Professor Chris Whitty last night, she said that social distancing might have to be in place for at least the next year.The First Minister also urged Scots to engage with this discussion - and stressed that no decisions had yet been taken.Documents from the Scottish Government talked about the need for a transition into the next phase - much like the Brexit period Britain is in now.They also discussed the possibility of dferent areas with dferent rules, such as cities and towns having to abide by dferent lockdown measures.The documents stated the Government were considering dferent restrictions in dferent areas dependent on how the pandemic is progressing.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEarlier Ms Sturgeon revealed students may be allowed back to school part-time, with social distancing still in place.She told Heart Radio: We might have kids going back to school for certain days a week.We may have to have children in a classroom so that we can have social distancing.However, the UK Government has made it clear the UK will not leave lockdown unless several conditions are met - including a steady drop in new infections and deaths.And ministers have insisted they will not begin to talk about how the measures will end just yet because they dont want to muddy the water by talking about an exit.The focus should be on staying home, Government ministers have repeatedly said, and they dont want to confuse the message.Ms Sturgeons intervention comes as Brits start to head to parks and more people travel on the roads in defiance of lockdown restrictions as the weather heats up.More traffic was reported in last nights Downing Street press conference, as some begin to tire of the measures in place.Last night Professor Whitty said the nation was still weeks away from seeing a signicant decline in numbers.He said: We are working with a disease we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future. lots of options which ministers will have to consider.They key to ending lockdown was to ease measures in way where no infected person is, on average, infecting more than one person.Ms Sturgeon also said she could introduce dferent measures in Scotland to that of the rest of the UK - comments Northern Irelands leader has stressed too.At the moment the UK is working together on a plan and there are no dferences in the approach for the four nations.Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has said measures could be eased at a dferent pace than in other parts of the UK.She said the criteria for easing restrictions will be set down and agreed by the Northern Ireland executive as well the UK Government.She told Cool FM this could mean dferent parts of the UK movedferent times.Discontent is also growing among Conservative backbenchers who are calling for a clear, safety-first exit strategy from shutdown to protect the economy.Treasurer of the  Committee Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown is one of the leading voices in the demand for answers.Sir Geoffrey told BBC Radio : We need to start this discussion of how we get back to normality.Whatever we do needs to be done gradually, when the figures start to stabilise more in three to four weeks, hopefully we could begin to think about whats the next step.We have to think about the number of small businesses, who unless they get some form of business, may have to cease trading.We have to accept that at the moment a relatively small amount of the population has been exposed to the virus - we are going to expose more people to the virusHe said it was essential to open up parts of the economy, to rescue them from being completely decimated by the lockdown.I see no reason why garden centres, DIY stores with proper social isolating couldnt begin to open.Sir Geoffrey and other members of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers called a private meeting yesterday where they unanimously expressed deep concern of the continual lockdown, according to The Times.Sir Geoffrey said: The nation is quite ided on this and its up to the government, I think, to exercise leadership.Unless we do something fairly soon the economy is going to take a real hit.Vice Chairman of the committee Sir Charles Walker said There has got to be an economy to go back to.All MPs right now are dealing with dozensnot hundreds of local businesses that are fearing for their future.Building capacity within the NHS, reducing infection rates has to be the precursor to lting the economic lockdown.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Matt Hancock today spelt out more of his thinking about how the UK will know when to ease restrictions on peopleaposs lives.The Cabinet minister said the key factor in easing lockdown will be speed at which new coronavirus cases come down.But once it’s eased, thereaposs the risk of a second peak - and lockdown being re-imposed -the virus spikes again.So the key factor inkeepinglower restrictions will be a test, track and trace programme, designed to track down people whoaposve been in contact with Covid- and swtly isolate them.Some , officials are being recruited to monitor the movements of infected people, with the help of an NHS app. Mr Hancock said this programme could allow the UK to “hold down” the number of cases with “fewer restrictions”. But unlike the Scottish government, which has said schools and some shops could be first to reopen, he refused to say what areas of society might open up first. Ministers have previously said pubs and restaurants will be among the last to reopen. Speaking to ITVaposs Good Morning Britain, Mr Hancock said it was too soon to lt the lockdown.  Although each carrier is on average infecting less than one other person, it wouldn’t take much to lose that grip we’ve got on it, he said. And although easing lockdown depends on the fall in the number of new cases, that number is still unknown. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Now that weaposre at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and,and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will frankly will determine how long we need to keep the measures on and that is as yet unknown. He said it was not quite the case that mass testing and contact tracing needed to be in place before the current restrictions are eased. But he said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down. He added: The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down. And the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each inidual case that gets a positive test. You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate. The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.

But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. The idea is similar to one being looked at in Belgium. Experts there are reportedly considering allowing private gatherings of  people on weekends - but it would have to be the same people each week. While Ms Sturgeonaposs thinking would only apply to Scotland, it gives an insight into what might happen in the rest of the UK.  Scotlandaposs government has gone further than UK officials in laying out how lockdown might eventually be eased.Yesterday Ms Sturgeon published a -page document saying outdoor activities might resume, and businesses may reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart.The First Minister also suggested schools could reopen with modications needed in some classrooms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has refused to comment in detail on the plan for the whole of the UK. But today he said Ms Sturgeonaposs plan was essentially a reiteration of his own five tests of when lockdown can be relaxed. Those five tests are: the NHS able to cope a sustained fall in deaths infections dropping to aposmanageableapos rates adequate testing and PPE and no risk of a second peak. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland no decisions have been made on such a bubble arrangement. But she said she wants to have an open conversation with the public about the way forward.  Ms Sturgeon said: I know from my own parents who are not seeing their grandkids just know, I understand the anguish of that. Weaposre all missing seeing our loved ones so we all want to get beyond that as quickly as possible. Every country is going through these decisions, none of us are through this pandemic yet, but some countries are starting to look at slightly expanding what people would define as their household - encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody  who is on their own or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people. She added: And the key thing there is,youaposre seeing maybe one or two more people outside your household, itaposs got to be the same people on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis so youaposre still limiting the ability for the virus to transmit. Now, none of these are fixed decisions yet, but these are all the kind of things weaposre trying to work through.

Behind each statistics is a person who lost their le or was seriously wounded. With the focus on Covid-, this may not get it attention deserves. But do not let the Government off the hook. The rise in kne crime is the direct result of a decade of austerity, in which police numbers were cut and youth centres were shut. Boris Johnson is now promising to recruit more police.

However, the islands of Fuerteventura, El Hierro and La Gomera have had no fatalities.Canary Islands president Angel Victor Torres has reportedly been in talks with government officials in recent days about the phased plan to reopen the islands. Phase one would see relaxed measures be introduced, with a timetable drawn up allowing dferent groups of people such as the elderly or children to leave their homes at dferent times so that social distancing can be adhered to. People will be advised to wear masks in public and to use hand gel on a regular basis. The first week would allow hair salons to reopen as well as small shops. In the second phase, shopping centres would be able to open, as will gyms and possibly some hotels and tourist establishments but all with specic conditions and health regulations. The third week would see the opening of restaurants, with no more than four people per table, together with the beaches and swimming pools.

However, it is far too soon to say when Britons and other international travellers will be allowed to visit the islands again.

Mark Beaumont, , has been left devastated after his we Sharon, , died after contracting the killer virus. The mum-of-five passed away on Good Friday at the Princess Royal Hospital, in Orpington, Kent. Mark has driven Gareth and the team to and from the St Georgeaposs Park training ground, Wembley for matches and airports for international fixtures, for almost five years.  Following his weaposs death Mark received an outpouring of love and support from his community with £, being raised through a GoFundMe page. And Mark has revealed how he received a call out of the blue from Southgate offering his deepest sympathies and telling him: If there’s anything I can do, all you have to do is say the word. It was a touching offer from Southgate but came as no surprise to Mark. Mark said: “We’re just like one huge family.  When you see them out there, playing at Wembley, people don’t realise what it takes to get them there, what goes on behind the scenes. “I get involved in the kit as well, laundry. I’m not just the driver. I’ve been doing it for four or five years. “And to get a personal call from Gareth, he just said ‘If there’s anything I can do or the FA can do for your family, all you have to do is say the wordapos. “It’s just nice to hear. “We’re all just get on like a house on fire, he’s just fantastic. What you see is what you get.”  Sharon was rushed to hospital on March  after she began suffering from a temperature and cough over the weekend - before losing her sense of taste and smell. And she tragically passed away in intensive care on April  despite doctors working around the clock. The mum-of-five leaves behind daughters Laura, , Chantel, , Georgia, , son Lewis,  and granddaughter Amia, two. Tragically, Mark and Sharon lost their first daughter Chloe, after she was born with spina bida, a condition where the spinal cord and spine do not develop properly. Paying tribute to his “unbelievable darling” we, who he had been to married for almost  years, Mark said: “It’s a great loss to all of us. “Over the weekend, she started to have a temperature, dry cough and lost her sense of smell and taste. “After a few days, it just didn’t seem to be getting better so I rang  and they told us to self isolate for seven days but ring for an ambulancewe needed.  “On the eighth day, about am, she just couldn’t sleep, her temperature was up and down and I just knew she’d had enough. “I rang , and they redirected us to , which I did and they asked us to go to hospital. It was quite strange, there was no one  there. I was only allowed to stay for an hour. The next day, the family were told that Sharon had been diagnosed with pneumonia.  And two days later, Mark was told that she had also contracted coronavirus. He said: It just really escalated from there. She was on a normal oxygen mask first but then it turned out that she required a lot more oxygen. So she had to go on what they call a ers mask, which looked really uncomfortable. At that point she was on FaceTime with me and the family. It was so tough because at that time, we didnapost think it was going to end up the way it did. When she was on the ers mask, she couldnapost really say a lot because we couldnapost understand what she was saying. But, you know, obviously, she was looking at us and we were telling her she could get through it.  Then Iaposve got a phone call a couple of days later to say aposIaposm really sorry, Mark, but, unfortunately, sheaposs got to go on a ventilator.apos  Then the communication had to stop, it was an agonising time. Sharon, who had high blood pressure and Type  diabetes, was put in an induced coma - which she never came out of. Mark said: It was all up and down after that. One minute she looks like she was responding and it wasnapost happening. Then sadly, her kidneys started to fail so they put on dialysis. Then, I got the dreaded phone call from the doctors on Good Friday morning asking me to go to the hospital. I went into the hospital and spoke to the consultant and the head nurse.  And they said aposHonestly and truthfully, weaposve honestly done all we can for Sharon. But sheaposs got massive organ failure and internal bleeding as well.apos So I went and sat with her and FaceTimed her mum and it was just an awful time. And I got to say my goodbyes and be there when she passed. I came out and I just felt numb and empty. It felt like I was in a dream Iaposd wake up from. Mark then had the terrible task of telling the coupleaposs children that she had passed. Mark said:  Obviously, they knew that she was in hospital and I kept them informed all the time. We all prayed, Iaposm not a religious person, but Sharon was Catholic so we had candles and we had prayers every night. On the day she passed, they knew when I went that there was nothing  they could do. It was heartbreaking. Now the dedicated dad is planning her funeral - which can only have  guests due to coronavirus limitations. He said: We can only have  at the service, which is just immediate family. So thataposs been extremely dficult although it will also be on FaceTime. Itaposs just awful. You hear about it on the news and you hear about other people that may have contracted it and itaposs not too bad But when it when it hits home, itaposs just knocked us for six and the lockdown doesnapost help. But lucky for me, Iaposve got all my children around me and my little granddaughter. Weaposre all isolated together anyway, we did that from the onset, and itaposs the best thing weaposve ever done. Now Mark says he can feel the spirit of his we keeping him going amid the tragic circumstances. He said: I think sheaposs behind me pushing me. Sheaposs obviously saying to me, aposLook, come on Mark, you need to be strong for the family,they can see youaposre strong, theyaposre not going to feel so bad.apos I think her funeral is going to be one of the worst times. The couple met at a coach station in Harlesden where they were both working. Mark said: We both worked for the same company, I was a driver and then I was taken off the road. Sharon came in as secretary to the chairman. And I turned on the charm and when didnapost work, I just asked her out. The couple were set to celebrate their nd wedding anniversary on May th. But now, ahead of Sharonaposs funeral - the devoted husband has planned one final gesture to highlight his weaposs spirit. He said:  If there was one thing that me and Sharon were famous for, it was being late. Even on our wedding day, she was late. So Iaposve requested the undertaker to be five minutes late at the crematorium. Sheaposd thank me for this and sheaposd probably be laughing. Now Mark says he has been so grateful by the outpouring of love and support for his we. He said: Iaposm just so overwhelmed I havenapost got the words to express to people. I need to put out there a huge thanks, especially in this time of lockdown, when people donapost knowthey have jobs to go back too or much money. Itaposs times like this that our country pulls together. The amount of love weaposve been shown from people that I didnapost even know that knew Sharon, itaposs incredible. I just donapost have any words. I just get all choked up and start crying.

Usually a time for fasting, reflection and charity work,  has seen Muslims looking for new ways to observe rules and share food and time together. Digital technology is being used to help people enjoy online prayers and sermons, as well as to give to charity during the month-long celebration. Some key elements of Ramadan are undergoing radical change.Iftar, the meal to break the fast at sunset, is usually a time when friends and family come together to enjoy a feast of delicious food. Muslims then attend the Mosque for special Ramadan prayers called Taraweeh.But as we approach week six in lockdown, Iftars and Taraweeh prayers will be taking place in isolation as Mosque doors remain firmly bolted. Instead, many Mosques are going digital, offering online sermons, Islamic teaching sessions and live streaming prayers so Imams can still engage with the community. One of these is the Karimia Institute in Nottingham - they’re hosting a special Iftar programme on their community radio station at :pm. Readings from the Quran and short prayers will be shared via their Facebook page, which people can watch online before praying Taraweeh at home.Dr Musharraf Hussain OBE, CEO and Chief Imam at Karimia Institute says this year sees people being urged to find new ways to observe and celebrate. As he says: “We are telling people to stay home and don’t share Iftar with each other, technology has allowed us to communicate with the community, it is better than nothing.“Ramadan is always a time for inner development, reflection, patience and sympathy and of course charity. Muslims give a lot of money to charity during this month as well as recite the Quran. “The Quran plays an important role during Ramadan, they both tie in together and during the pandemic, people have turned to the Quran and many have improved their spirituality.”Since the lockdown Dr Hussain has also been giving online Islamic sermons and reciting short prayers called the Jummah Khutba on Fridays. Earlier this month, around  worshippers joined Dr Hussain online for Shab-e-Barat. The special day happens every year in the Islamic calendar and it is when Muslims believe Allahwrites their destinies for the coming year, after taking into account their past actions.  Ramadan is a month where Muslims give to charity too, with many people making donations to their local Mosques. Mosques rely on this cash to sustain services and maintain the buildings but since the pandemic, it has become increasingly dficult to raise funds.In response, Muslim crowd-funding  LaunchGood has launched The #SupportOurMosque campaign, which has been supported by the Muslim Council of Britain.This is just one example of Muslim communities coming together to support mosques.Harun Khan, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: “The message for this Ramadan is clear - fast and pray at home and share Ramadan digitally. This is the way to help save lives.“Ramadan is about connecting to God through worship, reflection, compassion and giving back to others.“It is important to use this time to reconsider, to reflect on the way we live our lives and the way we relate to our Creator, our communities and those in need. We must be sure to celebrate Ramadan in the safest way possible - in our homes.”In London a group of Muslims from dferent nationalities have created a Facebook video project called Ramadan Together - and they’ll be using other social media s including WhatsApp to reach out to friends and family.Photographer Mohamed Abdulle and filmmaker and writer Basma Khala will be sharing content showing how dferent cultures from around the world celebrate Ramadan. Mohamed - known as Mabdulle - is Somali, while Basma is a Sudanese, Irish Afro-Arab. The pair, who have made the short video, will discuss how the lockdown will affect Muslims during Ramadan this year.It features Muslim voices from across the world, including Egyptian blogger Dina Tokio, modest fashion model Mariah Idrissi, the first woman to model in a hijab, and BBC Radio presenter Mim Shaikh.Mabdulle said: “For me, Ramadan is about new beginnings and fresh starts. The thing that makes it so special is that it’s an experience we can all share as a community. It’s the one time of year where people from around the world come together like a big family.“Like the project, during Ramadan, you have people from all walks of le, from dferent countries, backgrounds - all taking part. It doesn’t matter who you are, Ramadan is a process that everyone can bond over.We spoke a lot during the project about how people used social media before to stay connected and it feels like it’s more important now than ever.“Thanks to Facebook and WhatsApp even though we’ll all be social distancing this Ramadan, we can all still share the experience. I don’t think anything can beat the experience of breaking your fast with your friends and family around you.A WhatsApp Group Call tar isn’t the same, but it’s close enough and I think it’ll be really fun.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nurse who turns dying coronavirus","story":"NewsNurse who turns off dying coronavirus patients ventilators suffers nightmaresOn one recent sht, NHS worker Juanita Nittla, , turned off a ventilator used by a coronavirus patient, who was a fellow nurse, and held a phone to her ear so the womans daughter so could say her final goodbyeShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video nurse-cheered-out-northwick-park-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news nurse-who-turns-dying-coronavirus-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It wasn’t a nice experience at all – I had hospital appointments which I found really traumatic. “At  I was told I wouldn’t be able lose the weight without surgery, which is quite a lot to process at such a young age. “The warnings did nothing to spur me on to lose weight. “They actually had the opposite effect because I felt so embarrassed and ashamed that I turned to food for comfort and gained even more weight. “It came at a time when I was being badly bullied at school as well, so it was all just too much. I couldn’t see how I would ever lose weight.”  Holly managed to slim down thanks to a carefully controlled Slimming World diet.  As well as a new-found confidence, size  Holly has found a passion for exercise. She explained: “I never used to do any physical activity because I was so unfit that I’d get out of breath after just a few minutes. I started going to the gym which is such a big thing for me – even having the confidence to walk into a gym is something I never could have done when I weighed st.  “I really enjoy the feeling of challenging myself and feeling positive about my body and what it can achieve.” Slimming World has temporarily suspended its groups due to the coronavirus outbreak. But Holly still attends her weekly group online and is loving the support she continues to receive from her fellow members each week.

But Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, says Ivan could not be the father. He said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.  There is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week.

Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people. Yes, the tasting pack will be part of the discussion, but there will be plenty of people around the world who have bottles of Adelphi open ndash or any whisky for that matter ndash and we want them to join us.ldquoAlex, Arthur and myself will be just having a general chat about whisky ndash yes, the focus will be on our whiskies ndash but we want to invite anyone whorsquos a fan to open a bottle and join us.So, to the critical question ndash whatrsquos going to be on show  Irsquom speaking to Mackenzie by phone, but I can almost see the glint of excitement in his eyes. ldquoWersquore pretty pleased with this list ndash and we hope the people who join us will be too hellipSo here are the drams:bull Ardnamurchan   Year Old Single Cask .% not- this is a bottling from Adelphirsquos own distillery, and the first taste of the actual whisky ahead of an release hopefully later this year.bull The Glover  Year Old Batch  .% not- a special mix of Ardnamurchan and whisky from the legendary Chichibu Distillery in Japan.bull Linkwood   Year Old Single Cask .%bull Caol Ila   Year Old Single Cask .%And just for a special treat:bull Bas Armagnac   Year Old Armagnac Single Cask .%So, how can I get involved, I ask Connal. ldquoWell, he said, ldquoeven though all our tasting packs have sold out, donrsquot let that bother you.

Yet caring, sharing Jacinda Ardern has done exactly the same in New Zealand. No foreigners have been permitted to enter since the Antipodean country the lockdown.Nor is there any certainty that New Zealandrsquos borders are going to reopen any time soon. At the very least, future immigrants will have to put up with quarantine and long delaysthey are allowed into the country at all. Itrsquos a Brexiterrsquos wet dream.In Scotland, the Government is under pressure to explain why, as The Herald reported recently, , people have been allowed to enter the country apparently with barely any health checks at all. This seems to be a UK policy. Border controls are not devolved, and the UK Government seems to want to keep airports open for business.SNP MSPs and MPs are also talking about closing Scotlandrsquos border. MP Joanna Cherry has demanded, at the very least, rigorous health checks and quarantine at airports. Commentators, like our own Neil Mackay, are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to detach Scotland from the failing Westminster Government and introduce a rigorous independent policy of test, track and trace following Germanyrsquos lead.You only need to look at what is happening in Singapore to understand why voters are concerned about the UKrsquos laissez-faire approach to border security. This scrupulously tidy city state had been the poster child for Covid management. Thanks to its experience of SARS a decade ago it was well prepared.The lockdown was rapid and the country adopted mass testing and contact tracing from the start. By the beginning of April, Singapore seemed to be well on top of he disease. Then came the second wave.On Monday, Singapore recorded more than , new cases of Covid , its highest ever. The country of five million people now leads south-east Asia in the virulence of this disease.And who are they blaming  Well, the one million migrant workers, from countries like Bangladesh, who sweep the city streets and tend its butterfly gardens. The most virulent new outbreak is in their cramped dormitories.The Singapore authorities have quarantined thousands of migrant workers into what are to all intents and purposes Covid concentration camps. Eye witnesses report squalid conditions, rats and poor food.Now, New Zealand is one of the most liberal and open societies in the world. But it is going to allow migrants to enter the country freely any time soon  Is it going to allow the four million or so annual tourists  My daughter is one of them. Shersquos been in a Queenstown backpackers hostel under lockdown for the last month.The ethnic dimension to Covid is going to be a huge issue in the near future. Itrsquos already clear that BAME people are more prone to getting this disease. That may be genetic, or it may be to do with their social circumstances and over-crowding. But it means that, in authoritarian countries, they risk being singled out for epidemiological social cleansing.Covid is changing the world in dramatic and disturbing ways. We are seeing a big increase in economic nationalism. The European Union has been riven with tension over Germanyrsquos reluctance to share the Covid-related debts of Italy.Global companies are suffering billions in losses from the disruption of international trade and are repatriating supply chains. This re-shoring, as it is known, had already been happening before Covid, as wages have risen in China, making manufacturing there less attractive.Apple canrsquot market its new phones because of disruption to factories in China. It canrsquot rely on foreign sweatshop labour any more because the sweatshops are going to be transformed to combat the disease.But the pandemic has added yet another dimension to it. There is huge uncertainty about when andborders will relax. It is beginning to look aswe may have economic disruption until a vaccine is found, and even after that.This is why Mr Trumprsquos much-criticised travel ban makes a great deal of sense from his nationalistic, America First, politics. The Presidentrsquos Twitter rants seem arbitrary, contradictory, callous and unthinking. And they are. But they are also politically astute.The Democrats have got themselves into a mess by attacking Mr Trumprsquos border closures. They accused him of racism when he banned flights from the European Union back in February. And again today. But his voters only see him following the example of other countries.America is a vast country, with a erse economy providing most of what it needs from corn to cars. It could effectively shut the world out. Indeed, the US is arguably much better placed to do that than New Zealand because it can do without many of the imports other more open countries depend on.Here, SNP supporters argue that, since Scotlandrsquos death rate is currently running at around half of Englandrsquos, Ms Sturgeon should be following Jacinda Ardern and locking the border. There is immense frustration that Nicola Sturgeon appears to be dictated to by the UK Government.Health is devolved and the Scottish NHS could have pursued a dferent policy. However, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, the Scottish Government is following the same scientic advice as England. There is no evidence that Ms Sturgeon would have followed a dferent course had Scotland been independent.But social media is echoing to demands to lock foreigners out of Scotland for safetyrsquos sake. Ms Sturgeon is an internationalist and will never do that. But the resurgence of nationalism across the world is making borders ever more important to voters.

Within Scotland there are, after all, wide iations, for example National Records Scotland reports that, up till April  NHS Grampian, population ,, had  Covid- deaths, or  per million, and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, population .m, , or  per million, almost three times as many and nearer Londonrsquos  per million.Similar wide iations occur across the UK, so I can understand Nicola Sturgeon and the UK Government considering dfering approaches on lockdown and resourcing that are regional or situation based, but why Scotland vs rUK What astounds me is the attempts to blame it all on politicians, and UK politicians at that. Undoubtedly there have been screw-ups, but little is made of the Herculean efforts to build the Nightingale hospitals, including one in Glasgow that will probably not be needed, arguably because the politiciansrsquo, expertsrsquo and NHS strategies and efforts are working.On Channel  last night , Professor Dame Anne Glover, the Glasgow-based former scientic adviser to the EU, opined that experts had been advising on the basis that this was a flu epidemic, did not advise lockdown earlier than it was carried out, and did not strongly propose mass testing.Tellingly, she said it is the expertsrsquo job to advise the politicians, but that politicians do not always want to hear. But in the case of Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon they have by and large been following a strategy based on their expertsrsquo advice.Who can imagine either leader attempting to force us into a lockdown that the estimable Jason Leitch, for example, said wasnrsquot yet required, and in the face of public and press outrage Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HAVING watched the excruciating performance of UK Heath Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday eveningrsquos Downing Street briefing, I feel that I must agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed in Neil Mackayrsquos article .Surely the present UK Cabinet must be one of the most incompetent on record. Despite the Tory Party being in government now for some  years it is utterly depressing that the leadership of the UK is so manestly weak. It is tragic that a time of such national crisis we look in vain for Government ministers who can at least give a much-better impression that they know what they are doing. Instead the last few weeks have been characterised by missed opportunities, strategic mistakes, confusion, a failure to learn from the experience of others and a chronic inability to be honest with the public. I would absolve the Scottish Government from this criticism. Of course there have been mistakes and problems, but at least they are being tackled with an honesty and transparency sadly lacking where.What a contrast with New Zealand. In todays edition you quote Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Aucklandwho very succinctly summarises the misery being endured in the UK. ldquoThe countryhas managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that had hampered the response in many other placeshellipNew Zealand got everything righthellipdecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody. What a contrast with Westminster.A glance at the membership of Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet helps explain why the UK is in such a dreadful situation with a shockingly high death rate. Mr Johnson has surrounded himself with a team of sycophantic young Brexiters with virtually no track record of successful ministerial responsibility. His vindictiveness on taking office has seen most of the Tories of experience and ability such as Jeremy Hunt, languishing on the back benches or, like Dominic Grieve, driven out of politics altogether. It is not decisive leadership on the part of the UK Government that is pulling us through. Rather it is the hard work, dedication and sacrices of the devoted members of our NHS together with all those others support and care workers who are doing their best at great risk to their safety and emotional well-being.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD have thought thatthe Tory Party had any real sense of duty to the British public it would have invited the experienced Theresa May back into power as acting PM while Boris Johnson is hors de combat. I doubt, however, she would accept, having been stabbed in the back by the very same people.The one good thing about the Covid- pandemic is that for the generation to come at least, the records of the time-line from the initial whistleblowing of Dr Li Wenliang until we find ourselves back to normality will be embedded in their psyche. We will not, I pray, have to require drills and exercises between pandemics, as next time we will be fully prepared. Wonrsquot we What will be the date we stop clapping frontline staff every Thursday evening  I understand that Mr Johnson likes to quote the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. He would be better referring to Bertolt Brecht, who said: ldquoUnhappy the land that is in need of heroes. Thank goodness we still have so many ordinary people who can become valiant and heroic. The ordinary people of the UK have shone while our leaders have proved wanting.It is, however, a lesson in preparedness that only  years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles to formally end the ldquowar to end wars we were at war with Germany yet again. It is within the grasp of humanity to learn nothing.Questions have to be asked, therefore,the World Health Organisation has the power and capacity to effectively force the containment of another such viral outbreak to within its own zone  Perhaps there is the need for a newly-drafted international health treaty with robust penalties on all nations where they fail to act decisively and swtly.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.IT is clear that this country will be facing immense economic and social challenges throughout the years ahead. There is already a widespread recognition that much has to be done in order to restore public expenditure to a level appropriate for any enlightened country. For instance, no longer must those essential workers we celebrate each Thursday evening be refused decent levels of remuneration. No longer can we be indferent to the consequences of  years of austere Conservatism for those at the margins of society referred to by David J Crawford in his letter of  April.There needs to be a debate on the redistribution required to create a far less unequal society. That means that those of us who are in receipt of generous salaries and pensions must face up to the consequences for us of any such redistribution. This is not only a matter of sourcing the resources needed. It is a matter of demonstrating that we, the more fortunate, must admit that our relative prosperity is dficult to justy while child poverty, being one example among so many, is such a scandal.I quote the recent words of the Bishop of Kensington. We must ldquolearn the capacity to sacrice our own desires for the sake of the wider community, recognising that ldquomaybe coronavirus is giving us a crash course in a dferent moral universe ndash one that might just be the saving of us.John Milne, Uddingston.I WORK in construction in England and have done for four years due to the lack of work in Scotland: in England and Wales with the exception of TFL Projects in London, all construction work is still ongoing, builders merchants and manufacturing companies which closed initially have all now re-opened and operating sites have re-written their safe systems of work to ensure they are working safely within the Governments guidelines on social distancing, as is the case in Europe in Spain, Germany and Sweden as an example.In Scotland this industry is currently at a standstill unless it is essential work the construction of the Louisa Jordan hospital is one example. How come this pound million project was delivered safely while all other construction work in Scotland is on lockdown A lot of construction work can be achieved with simple social distancing measure Ts. so why is the Scottish Government not looking to give this industry the same advice and support issued by the UK Government his would be one industry that could start to support the Scottish economy immediately as well as many of the self employed who will not benefit from the UK Governments wages support schemes. The last thing the Scottish workforce needs now is further contraction of an already seriously diminished market.On whose advice is the First Minister basing her Governments guidance when the industry is operating normally everywhere  John McWilliams, Coatbridge.THERE appears to be growing unease in some countries about the part played by the Chinese government in allowing the initial spread of coronavirus.The US state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government for \"lying to the worldrsquorsquo and \"silencing whistle-blowers\". The Chinese Embassy in Australia has accused Aussie politicians of joining in US orchestrated anti-Chinese rhetoric.The last thing the world needs at the moment is a witch hunt and blame-pinning exercise, but anyone following events from the start would, I am sure, agree that the Chinese authorities have at the very least serious questions to answer.At the end of the present nightmare, a thorough investigation is needed and lessons learned.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

We cannot afford to have exceptions.\"Each one of us will have to adapt to this as the new normal, at least until we are sure that we can be more protected by a vaccine or treatment.\"If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to re-impose them, possibly ing to lockdown with little notice.\"While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.\"The document warns easing restrictions will not mean ing to how things were before the virus.It says ministers will take \"distinctive decisions for Scotlandthe evidence tells us that is necessary\".Options for ying the restrictions include full and partial lting of existing measures.Variations by geography, by sector, or by specic groups of the population could also be introduced.Ms Sturgeon said the number of people in Scotland who have died after testing positive for the virus is ,, up by  from , on Wednesday. A total of , people have now tested positive, up by  from , the day before.The number of people in intensive care and hospital in Scotland has fallen in the past  hours, by seven to  and by  to , respectively, which she said is cause for \"real optimism\".Her comments come as experts from Oxford Universitys Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said their analysis of Covid- data in Scotland suggests the peak of the virus may have passed.Professor Carl Heneghan called on the Scottish Government to begin opening up the economy as soon as possible to help fight a second wave in winter as he believes the virus is seasonal.A Framework for Decision Making says Covid- causes harm in at least four ways.The first is the \"direct and tragic harm to peoplersquos health\", while the second is the wider impact on Scotlands health and social care services.The third is the harm to society, including the effects of isolation and the impact on childrens wellbeing from closed schools.The last is the \"enormous impact on our economy, with a potential fall of  per cent in GDP during the period of lockdown\".The document adds: \"This is unprecedented and is causing deep uncertainty and hardship for many businesses, iniduals and households.\"The damaging effect on poverty and inequality may be profound.\"Closures and job losses have been inevitable, even with the unprecedented support provided by government.\"And the impacts will intensy the longer the lockdown continues: we will see more businesses unable to recover and we risk the scarring effects of unemployment.\"The risks of increasing hardship and increasing poverty are real. This in turn risks damage to the health of the population.\"We must do everything possible to avoid permanent, structural damage to our economy.\"Ms Sturgeon said the paper is the start of an \"adult conversation\" about how lockdown restrictions could be lted.Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, said maintaining a ldquofour nations approach was essential to tackling the pandemic, and suggested the Scottish Governmentrsquos plan was based on his five tests for relaxing lockdown measures.He also stressed the need for all four governments of the UK to continue working together.When asked by the Herald why Westminster had not been able to produce a similarly detailed plan to that of the Scottish Governmentrsquos, he said: ldquoWe have set out the five tests that are needed for us to make changes to the lockdown measures and the Scottish Government proposals are based on those tests.The minister said a united approach from Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland was ldquothe best way to go and said: ldquoI think that having the four nations of the UK work together on this has been important thus far, not just on social distancing but on testing. The country has essentially moved together.ldquoItrsquos important that us having set out our tests, and now the Scottish government has set out its approach, which is very similar and based on the five tests we have set out, that a UK-wide approach is the best way to go.Opposition parties welcomed the Scottish Governments paper, but also stressed the importance of a UK-wide exit strategy.Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said: ldquoThe priority remains to save lives, protect the NHS and social care system and ensure the ongoing protection and welfare of vulnerable groupsldquoWe should begin on a phased basis to restore non-essential public services and amenities and enable people toto work, consistent with ensuring the achievement of the first three priorities.\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said a phased approach to lting the lockdown was right, and should be based on the principle that saving lives and peoples health must \"take priority over commercial interests\".He said cross-border co-operation is critical.The Scottish Greens said more detail was needed, particularly on testing.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said it will shortly publish a guide for retailers to help the wider industry re-open stores \"in a safe way once government indicates they can do so\".________________________________________________________________News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Age is revered within the Gothic Palace, no more so than in the gilded House of Lords, where time passes either slowly or very slowly.As time has passed for me and snow has now settled on the roof, I have seen novice MPs rail and rage against the antique practices of the Gothic Parliament, only for them a few years in to become zealous defenders of its noble traditions.Of course, it cannot be denied that some of the traditions are more noble than others. The days of MPs having to wear a top hat to make a point of order have thankfully passed.But there is sometimes an unseen logic behind some parliamentary practices.Calling someone honourable or right honourable might seem quaint but it is meant to keep the atmosphere in the chamber genial it is hard, so the theory goes, to be overly disparaging to a political opponentyou have to call him or her honourable. Although, wit and irony can be the greatest of parliamentary weapons.One of the more incomprehensible traditions that perplexes and annoys new MPs is the voting system. When legislatures around the globe use technology to cast votes in the blink of an eye, the denizens of Westminster have to traipse through wide, dusty corridors to have their names ticked off in a ledger, Hogwarts-style.Not long ago, the youthful SNP MP Hannah Bardell fell foul of the Commons Speaker when she took to social media to post a video from within the Lobby, showing just how ridiculous it all was for honourable members to go through -minute vote after -minute vote to decide on interminable parts of the Brexit process.While many would say the Livingston MP had an extremely good point, others would suggest there is a practical reason for what seems an inane impracticality the delayed process gives the party whips a chance to gently, or not so gently, encourage colleagues to file into the correct lobby pressing a button would rob them of the time to use the black art of persuasion.Resistance to change meant that in the late s there was, to say the least, a deal of opposition to the TV cameras being allowed in to broadcast democracy in action many MPs thought voters would be more interested in hairdos and clothes than what was actually coming out of the mouths of their politicians.But now, necessity has once again pulled up at the gates of Westminster and MPs are being asked to skip a century from the th to the st.The video-conferencing tool of Zoom is being used, which to many members was hitherto an ice lolly from their salad days of the s.As I write, the initial experiment has gone relatively well. There were, of course, a few glitches. David Mundell, the former Scottish Secretary, was, MPs were told, ldquounable to connect during the first digital PMQs. No comment.Learning to use the mute button seems to be one of the more important aspects. During the Lordsrsquo virtual session Green peer Baroness Jones admitted she was slow to unmute and eventually askedshe could put her question but was graciously told she was too late.However, the most embarrassing moment in this new age of digital parliamentary democracy came when Vaughan Gething, the Welsh Health Minister, turned the air blue with an expletive-laden tirade to make matters worse it turned out to be against one of his own Labour colleagues Jenny Rathbone.He later apologised to her but, somewhat disdainfully, brushed the incident aside on Twitter as an ldquounwelcome distraction at a time of unprecedented challenge. The unprecedented challenge being coronavirus, of course, not new technology.Asto demonstrate how our unhurried Parliament adheres to a process of evolution rather than revolution, MPs backed electronic voting well, almost.That model of modernity Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out that a committee of MPs would first look at the procedure and assess whether it was \"workable\" or not. Which is a fair point the last thing the Commons wants is for a vote to be invalidated. Although, I gently point out, they do seem to have nailed down how to do electronic voting in other parts of the UK and across the globe, where parliaments have been pressing buttons for many years.The urbane Commons Leader reappeared this week at the dispatch box to announce even he had to agree to go with the technological flow this week albeit one could sense with a deal of pin-striped reluctance.\"In , the Old Etonian declaimed, ldquowhen the Black Death affected this country, Parliament couldnt sit and didnt the session was cancelled.ldquoThanks to modern technology, even I have moved on from  and Im glad to say that we can sit to carry out these fundamental constitutional s.

Being ahead of everyone , what I can tell you is that being isolated from friends and family does have an impact on ones emotion wellbeing and mental health. I am becoming emotionally fatigued by it. I can also say that for the chief scientic and medical officers to continue to state such measures will continue into next year further compounds the dficulty.May I say, both UK and Scottish governments have to appreciate that it is totally unrealistic for the population to be asked to socially distance from family and friends for such an extended period. It is undoable. It would forever damage the fabric of what makes up community and society.I not only speak for myself, but many friends and family, who are abiding by the guidelines presently, are also voicing their view, a shared view that le is not worth livingthe one thing, social interaction is forbidden. My prediction is that community could possibly last a further few weeks, but then many, myself included, would break out and disobey the guidelines and the Scottish Government and even UK Government could do little against mass disobedience or it would risk civil unrest.The governments in the UK are democracies, not autocracies.

How I wish we \"oldies\" were allowed such personal freedom by Holyrood and Westminster.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.WITH veriable facts surrounding Covid- hard to come by, the only thing beyond dispute is that we are currently led by two of the most isive administrations in a generation who, for the last decade have fomented ision in society, in pursuit of their own ideological brands of nationalism: Brexit and Scottish independence. This fact makes it all the harder to give them credence, when in the midst of this crisis, they call for society to come together. They are lauded and decried in equal measure.The First Minister has, thankfully, kept the most ideological weirdos on her front bench away from the cameras, with only the Health Secretary getting a regular airing and even then, she mostly parrots whats just been said by the FM.Meanwhile, circumstances have dictated that the PM has had to rely on his Cabinet colleagues. The paucity of talent there has been obvious from Dominic Raab, who clearly baulks at being anything other than partisan, to the simply awful Gavin \"I was sacked by Theresa\" Williamson, they inspire no confidence whatsoever.That the politicians have let the scientists do the heavy lting so far, is another indisputable fact. One hopes that they have done this in order that they can bring their vast political experience to bear on how we turn the economy around  Here, we have to rely on their past record to give us hope that they can.But lets look at that record:  years of Tory LibDem, then Tory again, politically-driven austerity a nine-year SNP council tax freeze, again politically driven, to woo middle-class voters to the independence cause, which saw council budgets and services slashed, and the third sector left to pick up the slack. If there is hope in this mediocre bunch, I simply cannot see it.May you live in interesting times, someone once said. We certainly are at the moment. The other indisputable fact is that it will be our children and, to use the hoary old quote, our childrens children, who will be left to pay off the eye-watering debt that the pandemic has caused. Other than that, very little is certain at the moment.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.IT is true, as the Chief Medical Officer of England said, explaining why there is no Covid- testing of passengers at UK airports, that a person can be tested there, show no symptons of Covid-, but develop signs a day or two later in the wider community. It is also true that border control is not a Scottish Government competence, so it can only ask for review of UK policy . But once passengers pass passport control and customs, they come within the Scottish Governments competence and can be tested before being allowed to leave the airport, or placed in quarantine.The CMO of Public Health England may be correct about one passenger, but surely not of all coming off an aircraft, and it is most unlikely to be true in respect of every one of the , coming into Scotland on a weekly basis. We dont need a review of UK policy to institute testing at Scottish airports, and it would seem wise for the Scottish Government to exercise its powers to do so.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.YOUR front page todayhighlights the problem of deaths other than from coronavirus.

If a motor car business can adapt to making ventilators how canrsquot some of our textile and industrial clothing companies not adapt to making these vital items  We have better quality aprons and household gloves in our kitchen than I wore the other day. Surely to goodness some UK companies must be able to produce PPE to the specication required by our health protection agencies.Brian Watt, Edinburgh EH.AFTER Covid- has subsided we must tackle inequality by making sure the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes and clamp down on offshore investments, trust funds and the use of tax havens by companies and iniduals.However, the signs are not encouraging when Dominic Raab dismissed Ian Blackfordrsquos call at PMQs for a Universal Basic Income , and more so when the new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer aligned himself with the Tories and the DUP by failing to sign the cross-party petition, which included many Labour MPs, calling on the Chancellor to introduce a Recovery Universal Basic Income in response to the coronavirus crisis.Last week Reform Scotland published a briefing paper ldquoOne For All: The Case for a Basic Income Guarantee proposing that every citizen, regardless of income, gender or employment status, received a set amount of money, free of tax, but in place of personal allowances, tax credits and a number of other benefits which would ensure no one would slip through the complex net of DWP bureaucracy.

Slightly awkward, standing with my cousin Noreen on my first trip away from home, I glistened and gleamed with shiny black hair and bright red lips. We went out in London, to a club and I remember feeling lsquoseenrsquo for the first time. It was like the much over-used shot in films where the camera moves through groups of people in a club. The little glances, and smiles from those we passed, people half-stepping out of our way to let us through, striking up interesting conversations with people we met for the first time. The attention was intoxicating and addictive. I confess, I loved being seen.Fast forward  years later, when I found myself in a club in Glasgow on an impromptu works night out. Two well-toned young men are sitting opposite me and my friend, every so often their gaze straying towards the dance floor. There are lithe girls in heels and bits of string, cleverly gyrating and somehow keeping the strings in place, blaring Latin American music that causes a disturbance in my right eardrum and strobe lighting that plays havoc with my ocals.Instinctively, I bend over, almost hitting my head off the table and scream, fishwe-like, above the music: ldquoThere you go boys. Is that better  Can you see now Seeing the Me at  posts inevitably makes us compare then and now, and for me came the realisation that in the space of  years Irsquod gone from being seen and enjoying being seen, to being invisible and I wondered how and why this happened and how I feel about that.Discussing this phenomenon with friends, Irsquove discovered Irsquom not alone. One -year-old fumes indignantly about being jostled in queues, cut up on pavements and ordered-over at bars by people standing behind her. ldquoItrsquos as , with my youth going, Irsquom not relevant or important, and thatrsquos quite hurtful. At parties or social gatherings she feels her voice isnrsquot heard and her opinions donrsquot matter. Talking to her puzzled me. With her sharp mind, great wit and an attractiveness I have always admired, she was the last person I would have thought of as invisible.Another friend, a comedian, has an explanation. She thinks we might be projecting how we are feeling about ourselves as we age. For her, it is more about how we, as women, were conditioned aged  to see our value. ldquoMy whole self-worth, when I was young, was based on how people, but mostly men, saw me. If they complimented me I valued myself. Now Irsquom older I donrsquot get the compliments so much, but whereas on the one hand you can lose your self-worth because of that, or like me, you can change the yardstick.In the intervening  years shersquod come to use a dferent yard stick, and maybe for some of us, we havenrsquot quite got there yet.But itrsquos more than that, I think. I have sat at the dinner table with my teenage sons and felt invisible. The way they jabber away excitedly about online strategy games or bits of new tech to one another, reminds me of Wendy Craigrsquos character Ria in s sitcom Butterflies ndash happy to see her boys cheerful and animated but ostensibly a ghost in her own home. And, asfulfilling the prophecy, we are encouraged to cut our hair short, wear more neutral tones , and tone down our make-up.

In the age of the selfie, Instagram and now, of course, video calls via Zoom, being lsquoseenrsquo, is  hours of being camera ready, with all the insecurities that can bring and the endless stream of looks-related comments on the social media feed from all corners of the globe.Uzma Mir: Are we all playing happy families during lockdown  No  Me neither...Being lsquoseenrsquo is being seen through the lens of a skin-tone softening, teeth-whitening filter that, once removed, leaves a sense of intense disappointment, and gut-wrenching fear of what people might be thinking or saying about the unfiltered material.Invisibility brings with it that sweet liberation of knowing that the worldrsquos gaze is averted where leaving us the power to just be our authentic selves, and to be comfortable with that.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

The event was to raise money for the NHS and social care charities. The composer,he can be so described, is the man who flew from New York in  just to vote in the Lords in support of a bill to cut tax credits to the working poor. He was also caught up in a tax avoidance controversy, as was the man who sang the first few lines, Gary Barlow who, along with two other members of Take That and their manager, had to pay back pound million to HMRC. A sick bag is called for.Or, as Clement Attlee, the Prime Minister who introduced the NHS put it, ldquoCharity is a cold, grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim.You donrsquot need a weatherman hellipAs far as I know there is no brass plaque on the wall of the Millennium Hotel in Glasgowrsquos George Square to record the first visit to this country of a Nobel prizewinner and solid platinum legend called Robert Allen Zimmerman. If the ledger of that visit still remains, with his signature and room number, it would fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction.It was in the early afternoon of May , , that he checked into what was then the North British Hotel, in the days when British Rail was not only nationalised but ran hotels as well as a huge property empire. He, like the hotel now, had adopted a dferent name, Bob Dylan. He spent one night there with his band, The Band, then called The Hawks.This tour was to become historic, notorious for the barracking he received. In the second half, just as he was to do in the Odeon in Renfield Street that night, Dylan would strap on a Fender Stratocaster and, with The Hawks, blast out a set of his new electric songs.The night before, at the Manchester Free Trade Hall, someone had screamed ldquoJudas at him. He replied ldquoI dont believe you!....Youre a liar, before telling the band to turn up the volume and cascading into Like A Rolling Stone.So he probably wasnrsquot looking forward to that nightrsquos show at the Odeon . From being the darling of the folk purists -year-old Dylan had become an object of pure hatred and the heckling had become part of the spectacle on the tour. Glasgows Young Socialists even dragooned as many members as they could to go along and boo, but they were overwhelmed and largely drowned out by the positive response.There were some walkouts and chants, perhaps organised by the YS, of ldquoWe want Dylan, to which he replied, ldquoDylan got sick backstage. Im here to take his place.On YouTube therersquos footage of Dylan with Robbie Robertson from The Hawks in the NB Hotel bedroom jamming a -bar blues called What Kind Of Friend Is This. Therersquos even a brief cutaway to the Odeon sign.That bedroom was the scene of a sadly typical Glasgow event. A waiter arrived at the door bringing food and suddenly screamed, ldquoF*** him at Dylan, accusing him of being ldquoa f***ing traitor to folk music.Dylans driver-bodyguard Tom Keylock quickly huckled the man out of the room. He recalled: ldquoHe pulls a kne on me. Ive still got the scar to prove it. So I gave him a good kicking. The bands tour bus was also tanned, with recording and hi-fi equipment stolen.Next day, prior to travelling to Edinburgh and the ABC, Dylan was in a good mood. Therersquos an outtake from an unreleased documentary, Eat The Document, by the \"Dylanologist\" DA Pennebaker, where Dylan watches police dog handlers in George Square with pipes skirling off-camera, probably from a police band. As as he gets into the car to leave Glasgow a crowd of kids surround him waving autograph books . He asks themthey were at the gig the night before andthey had booed. They vigorously deny it. ldquoI want the names of all the people who booed, he jokes before driving off.Headline of the weekSurely  lsquoScots sex offender in coronavirus prison rooftop protest lured down with pack of super noodlesrsquo.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service. I welcome that assurance and hope it will allow access to justice for more people in Orkney, and where in Scotland, who need it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom.

Many farmers and crofters have already responded to our call not to leave it to the last minute # but we need more of you to do so.“Now, more than ever, it’s crucial we keep money flowing into our rural communities and keep funding our crofters and farmers.“We know that crofters often seek the support of our area office staff to complete and submit their SAF applications and, usually, that has involved a last minute rush in the first two weeks of May. In normal times, this is manageable – but these are unprecedented times.“Our staff are working incredibly hard and are still directly helping customers by phone, but the changes to our usual way of working mean that we cannot currently offer face-to-face support, or for people to simply drop by their local office. Phone support will inevitably take longer and I would therefore encourage you to consider submitting your application online.  Area Office staff can support you to access our online system and ensure you have access to up to date information to help you in completing your SAF. The online system will also provide checks to ensure basic errors are avoided.”“So I am asking crofters in particular to schedule an appointment now to progress their applications by phone. We still have the option of extending the SAF window beyond  May but the current rate of applications suggests that should not be needed # providing people respond to this request.“Whatever  you were planning to do today and this week, please make time to submit your SAF or make an appointment to get support to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible.

Councils such as Cromer Town Council, in Norfolk, and City of Lincoln Council reversed their decision to close their cemeteries following the latest government advice, they said. In the Republic of Ireland, meanwhile, all cemeteries are open to the public but there are the same funeral restrictions as here in Northern Ireland.Does the law apply to council and church cemeteries The law applies to both council and church cemeteries. However, due to the nature of some church cemeteries, it is not physically possible to close off the grounds to the public.What happens when a funeral is taking place A maximum of  close family members can be present at the funeral of a loved one - with social distancing in place - at private services and committals at cemeteries.Whose decision is it to reopen the cemeteries While cemeteries are operated by local councils in Northern Ireland, it is ultimately the Stormont Executive that holds the legal power to decideand when they should be reopened to members of the public.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr McGowan said the classes will be extended to other streets in Creggan over the weekend because the response has so positive.He added: This has really struck a chord with everyone. We have children doing squats and a woman at  years of age out jogging on the spot outside her front door.It is creating a great buzz around the streets. A lot of people aren#t getting out for the hour#s exercise they are permitted so it is giving them a safe space to do that.These are properly qualied instructors who are coming into the streets and leading them in a structured routine that is also a bit of craic and a bit of fun.They arrive with a PA, system, a cordless mike - they put the music on and away they go for half an hour.We are mindful as an organisation about the guidelines around gathering crowds so that is why this works so well because people are staying in their own gardens.

The community in Magherafelt responded to a plea from nurses for accommodation in the area and within  hours, a house had been located and refurnished ready for them to move in. Mid Ulster councillor Darren Totten had been alerted to the nurses’ plight and set in place a train of events that would reveal a heart-warming tale of community spirit.

It was a bit rough round the edges, it had been lying empty for a while.  “The fella that has recently bought it had said to me a few weeks ago thatit was of any use to anybody, to use away at it. He brought the keys down and left them with me.” googletag.cmd.push Darren posted online appealing for help to make the house a bit more inhabitable for the healthcare staff and found himself inundated with offers from both friends and strangers. “I threw it up on Facebook asking for a favour from anyone who could help kit a house out from start to finish,” he said. “There were people who came here with tins of paint. Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-. He said: “They were over the moon. They would have taken it as it was on Saturday morning, but I asked them to give me a day or two to make it a bit more homely for them. “The whole thing took legs, there’s a real good will out there at the minute and not a penny changed hands. “It was all hands to the pump and it was amazing to be part of it.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival.

We are now entering the th day of lockdown with strict regulations in place to curb the spread of Covid-. The current situation is set to last until at least May  and as many seek comfort from the virus’ threat, they are turning their attention towards happier days. Re-runs of old TV programmes are filling the airwaves. The GAA has made  All-Ireland finals available to watch online. News archives are being pored over for hidden gems. Nostalgia is king at the moment, but Maghera psychologist Sarah Connell is not surprised by the phenomenon. googletag.cmd.push “It’s a really comforting emotion,” says the owner of Minding Me Psychologists. “It brings back times when we’ve been accepted and loved, and it provides some badly needed relief in these times of uncertainty. “People are generally frightened by change, because we don’t always feel like we’re in control of things. Having that sense of being in control is really important for our well-being. “We can retreat to the past and think of when times were good, and we felt like we were in more control of things. I think that really helps us to be more stabilised and feel better about things. googletag.cmd.push “I think sometimes we can use it as a wee bit of an escape as well. It can take us out of the situation we are in that, for some people, is really challenging.” Although nostalgia is widely regarded as a positive emotion, this was not always the case and early research into the area deemed it to be a psychological problem. The term was coined by Swiss doctor Johannes Hoffer in , who deemed it a ‘neurological disease of essentially demonic cause’ after studying Swiss mercenaries stationed abroad. It arose from the Greek terms nostos – meaning a yearning tohome – and algos – its associated pain. Hoffer also concluded that the condition may have been caused by incessant cowbells in the Alps causing damage to the soldiers’ ears and brain cells. Even throughout the th and th centuries, it carried the stigma of ‘immigrant psychosis’, a form of ‘melancholia’ and a ‘mentally regressive compulsive disorder’. Sarah describes the concept as ‘bittersweet’ and refers to it as a ‘double-edged sword’. “Because it triggered dissatisfaction and lots of negative emotions like stress, fear and loss, it was interpreted as something you don’t want to have,” she says. “It really is bittersweet. It’s sweet because we’re remembering the good times, all the things that were good in the past, but it’s bitter because we know we can never regain that experience. “It’s gone forever. Time is irreversible and there’s something really sad about that. “The song ‘Days of Our Lives’ by Queen has the lines: ‘Can’t turn back the clock, can’t turn back time, ain’t that a shame’ and I think that really summarises it well. “Although it’s a lovely thing to think back, we can’t turn back the time. It’s really positive in one way but there’s a downside to it as well.” Nostalgia is often triggered by activities that people enjoy, such as music or sport, and Sarah says this is especially the case during a time of psychological distancing. “It can really help counteract feelings of loneliness,” she said. “It’s a huge link because those [music and sport] are things we love. If we think back to times when you played a good match, or went to an enjoyable concert, those are happy memories. “Nostalgic thoughts unite us with people again in our minds. It increases the perception of social support and reminds us of a time when we were with people, doing things and enjoying them.” A rise in nostalgia can often be a result of coming face-to-face with your own mortality and as the death toll in Northern Ireland reaches , people are increasingly worried. “It’s giving them that sense that you actually can die,” says Sarah. “Some people are quite concerned about it, but others probably still feel an element of ‘that’s not going to happen to me’. “One thing many are most concerned about is the economic effect that it’s having. They’re concerned about job loss – a lot of people have been furloughed. “They’ll be wonderingtheir job will continue after this period and what will happen in terms of paying bills and mortgages. The fear that we are going to go into recession is causing worries. Through talking to clients, Sarah has heard many people talk about the unexpected positive aspects that have arisen from the effects of the lockdown. She says: “I am hearing a lot of people really focusing on the positives, which is great. They are loving having more precious time to spend with their families and their children. “Little things like the slower pace of le – you can hear the birds singing more in the mornings. It’s giving time for people to reflect and re-evaluate their lives. Although the psychological distancing that we are currently having to enforce increases feelings of isolation and loneliness, people are adapting. Sarah says: “People are finding ways of coping with it by trying to find a bit of regularity in their lives - doing things like exercise every day and keeping some kind of structure to their day. “We’ve gone from being able to do whatever we want to having massive restrictions on us. “None of us like being told what to do or being held back from living our lives how we want to live them. “We’re having to draw on our willpower to focus and do the things that are right for ourselves and for everyone.” If nostalgia can act as a buffer against the fear and frustration caused by Covid-, then open that GAA archive, put on the old TV re-runs and wallow in reminiscent therapy.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals.

If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well.

Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

Please try again later.Submitting...Make sure your dog has a comfy bed or den, where they can relax in peace.Give them something fun to occupy them, such as a long-lasting treat or puzzle toy.While your dog is enjoying their treat, take a couple of steps to the other side of the room. If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcacbecfcfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edfebbdea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
