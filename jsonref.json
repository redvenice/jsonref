The Clooneys made the wedding and the after party guest list, and Markle family seats in the church were taken by stars like Oprah WinfreyI wasn’t entirely surprised though given my own bizarre ‘ghosting’ experience with Ms Markle that suggested to me she’s a ruthless social climber.No wonder then that her family feel less than enamoured towards the newly ennobled Duchess: she’s dumped them all like a sack of rancid potatoes, lest they poison her perfect new privileged royal well.I thought of this today when I read George Clooney’s impassioned defence of Meghan over recent negative headlines.He attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was, and it’s history repeating itself.’He ended with a chilling warning: ‘And we’ve seen how that ends. I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to see that.’Hmmm.  On Monday George Clooney attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’ Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was\u0027George Clooney claims his friend Meghan is being \u0027pursued...PIERS: Meghan Markle is a social climber and ghosted meShare this articleThere is a certain irony in Clooney saying all this just days after Meghan directed five of her best friends to speak to People magazine and knife her poor father in the back.Just as there was when Diana harangued the media for intrusion, but would repeatedly collude with newspaper journalists (I know, I was one of the people she colluded with!) to get herself positive press coverage and settle scores with people she didn’t like.Clooney at least is consistent he furiously blamed the media entirely for Diana’s death.To him, there is no correlation between using the press to promote or spin your brand, and then being scrutinised by the same press, sometimes critically.To me, there is.When she met Harry, Meghan wasn’t some naïve young 19-year-old virgin like Diana. She was a 35-year-old orcee with a successful acting career who knew exactly what she was doing.She landed her handsome, much younger Prince, and now enjoys the spectacularly opulent lifestyle of palaces and servants that comes with marrying into the British royal family.She has milked all the global fame and attention that’s subsequently come her way with obvious glee.  Meghan wasn’t a naïve  19-year-old virgin, but a 35-year-old orcee with a successful career when she landed her handsome young Prince. Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three stars living at Kensington PalaceAnd honestly, if this is the life Meghan’s always dreamed of, then good luck to her.But there is absolutely no comparison between the amount of media attention she gets and the amount Diana experienced.Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three biggest stars currently living at Kensington Palace.And Clooney is not just wrong about that.He’s also wrong to blame the media for negative headlines driven largely by Meghan’s own family.They are the ones vilifying her because she has disowned them all, and they understandably feel hurt about that.Meghan’s letter to her father, that he only disclosed this week after the People magazine cover story came out, was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood.It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER pain.But what about her dad’s feelings - HIS life, HIS pain?          Meghan’s letter to her father was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood. It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER painI’ve interviewed Thomas Markle twice, and get the impression he’s a decent guy who hasn’t had a clue how to handle the enormous media scrutiny that came when his daughter married a prince.Yes, he’s made mistakes, like posing for staged photos with the paparazzi, and he’s admitted to them.But he’s also lost his little girl, the one he helped bring up, educate, nurture and succeed. The one who posted a touching Father’s Day card on Instagram just weeks before she met Prince Harry, telling Thomas how much she loved him.Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, as she’s now doing, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us all believe?It’s staggering to me that Harry still hasn’t met the man whose daughter he married.It’s staggering to me that neither Meghan nor Harry has bothered to go see Thomas, even after he suffered a heart attack.          Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us believe? It’s staggering  that Harry never met the man whose daughter he marriedIt’s staggering to me that Meghan thinks the way to resolve this bitter dispute is to unleash her friends to attack her dad in People magazine.And it’s staggering to me that George Clooney now believes it’s a good idea to blame the media for everything, and compare Meghan to Diana.Clooney is a smart guy.He must have sat in the church at the big wedding and secretly shared everyone else’s view that it was very odd to see just one person from the bride’s entire family there amid a sea of celebrities.The problem here isn’t the media, which has largely given Meghan a very positive ride.The problem is Meghan’s incredibly toxic relationship with her family that shows no sign of abating and in fact, gets worse by the day.A real friend would tell her to get on a plane with her husband, and make peace with her ailing, flailing father – before it’s too late.But is George Clooney a REAL friend, or just another famous person Meghan’s latched onto at the expense of those who until recently, she professed to care about most?The biggest problem here may lie in the answer to that question."},{"url":null,"title":"Lindsey Vonn given surprise retirement party G O T cake boyfriend P K Subban","story":"    Vonn celebrates with her dog, Lucy, after winning bronze in Sunday\u0027s downhill at the World Championships - her final eventSkiing legend Lindsey Vonn returned home from the final event of her professional career to find that her boyfriend, Nashville Predators defenseman P.K.

It\u0027s not an easy thing to feel your bones hitting together and continue to push through it.          After the emotional weekend, Vonn told reporters, \u0027I\u0027m literally tapped out, I can\u0027t cry anymore\u0027\u0027Of course I\u0027m sore. Even before the crash I was sore. So I\u0027m just sore on top of sore. My neck is killing me,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027But at the end of the day no one cares if my neck hurts they only care if I win. ... I knew that I was capable of pushing through the pain one last time and I did that. ... Every athlete has their own obstacles and I faced mine head on today and I conquered them.\u0027Vonn had been planning on retiring in December but she recently moved up her plans due to persistent pain in both of her surgically repaired knees.

But she was like, No, I\u0027m going full out. She was definitely in the mindset to push it and she really did.\u0027It\u0027s a medal that brings Vonn full circle: the American\u0027s two silvers at the 2007 worlds on the same course in were the first two major championship medals of her career.          Vonn celebrates with Italy\u0027s Sofia Goggia (left) after winning bronze in Sunday\u0027s downhill \u0027I was weighing in my mind the risk of putting it all out there, crashing and getting injured again, as opposed to finishing where I wanted to,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027It was an internal battle.\u0027As soon as she exited the finish area, Vonn embraced Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark, the only skier to win more World Cup races than she did - 86 to 82.\u0027I basically begged him to come here via text, in all caps, many exclamation points,\u0027 Vonn said. \u0027He\u0027s an icon and a legend in our sport and he doesn\u0027t really like the spotlight but he deserves to have it.

I have felt really old for a long time, because I\u0027m racing with girls that are like 15 years younger than me. So now, in the real world, I\u0027m normal.

She is not thought to have married or had children.    It was only in 2011 that she re-emerged, when a German newspaper published an interview with her and sparking a flurry of interest in the last surviving members of the Nazi leadership\u0027s inner circle. In a documentary Pomsel talked about her three years working for the man responsible for spreading Hitler\u0027s poisonous ideology in newspapers and across the airwaves.She said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t see myself as being guilty. Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\u0027 Pomsel described in the film how she was told to keep the Nazi top brass supplied with alcohol \u0027in order to retain the numbness\u0027 and stave off the reality of their imminent defeat by the hated Russians.                                                       In 2011, Brunhilde Pomsel broke a 66-year vow of silence about the Nazi regime when she gave an interview to popular German newspaper Bild. Her revelations about the Nazi power circle\u0027s last moments shocked the world.She revealed that even after a lifetime of service, Goebbels barely acknowledged her: \u0027You couldn\u0027t get close to him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He never once asked me a personal question. Right up until the end I don\u0027t think he knew my name\u0027.Pomsel spent the last 10 days of the Third Reich in the cellars of the propaganda ministry as Russian artillery and American bombers flattened her surroundings.She continued to pump out orders from Goebbels until the very last minute - when Goebbels shot his wife then himself.Immediately before the murder-suicide, Goebbels and his wife killed their six young children by breaking cyanide vials into their mouth.Aides were ordered to pour petrol on the corpses of the dead generals - but the remains were only partially burned, and later found by the Red Army.On May 1 1945, shortly after \u0027The Boss\u0027 - Hitler - committed suicide, the Russians came into the bunker and \u0027dragged\u0027 Pomsel out. She spent the next five years as a prisoner of the Russians in special camps.She claims not to have known about the Holocaust: \u0027I was a stupid, politically uninterested little sausage of simple means. I only learned about the Jewish extermination programme after the war. Goebbels never mentioned it in his correspondence.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/13/16/06C47093000005DC-0-image-a-2_1550076124802.jpg","title":"May heaps pressure BBC fund free licence fees 75s","story":"    At PMQs today Theresa May insisted taxpayers want to see the BBC use its \u0027substantial\u0027 licence fee income in an \u0027appropriate way\u0027 to deliver fully for UK audiencesOpposition MPs and campaigners have warned that hundreds of thousands of over-75s will lose out if the free scheme is ended, blaming the Government for devolving responsibility to the BBC - which has a total licence fee income of around £3.8billion a year.Speaking at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Labour MP Rosie Cooper said: \u0027Despite her party\u0027s manifesto promise, nearly 7,000 pensioner households in my West Lancashire constituency could lose their free TV licences - often that\u0027s their only source of company.\u0027Is the Government going to keep their manifesto promise by taking back the responsibility they\u0027ve outsourced to the BBC to ensure that older people keep their TV licences?\u0027Ford warns no-deal Brexit would be \u0027catastrophic\u0027 amid...Can the Tories kiss and make up?

In 2007, Holy Cross selected a site for a new campus in Gentilly. Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education.\u0027The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage. In 1837, the Congregation of Holy Cross was founded.\u0027The Congregation took its name from a district in the city of LeMans, France – Saint Croix or Holy Cross. In 1849, the Archbishop of New Orleans invited five brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross to New Orleans to assume responsibility for operating St. Mary\u0027s Orphanage. The city had been devastated by a series of epidemics: cholera, yellow fever, and malaria.\u0027In 1859, the congregation purchased Reynes Farm, a riverfront plantation. In 1879, as the need for the orphanage diminished, St. Isidore\u0027s College, a boarding and day school was opened. This became the original site on which Holy Cross School stood and it is here that Holy Cross\u0027 history officially began. The area has since become a Federal Historic District known as the \u0027Holy Cross District.\u0027\u0027The General Assembly of the state of Louisiana chartered the institution on June 20, 1890, empowering it to confer bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees.

Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.‘Today’s caravans are a five-star experience,’ says holiday historian Andrew Jenkinson. ‘You can use them all the year round: modern tourers have full heating systems and double glazing. They are spacious, robust, ingeniously designed and incredibly comfortable. They have evolved.‘A few years ago, they tended to appeal mainly to older people who had fantastic memories of childhood holidays and had never lost the bug — or who wanted to rediscover it,’ says Andrew, author of caravan histories such as The CI Story. ‘But now lots of families are first-timers. Caravanning is enjoying a serious resurgence.’          Modern-day caravan: Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.

A model demonstrates the Mo-bed in 1959 The comeback is driven, Andrew believes, by both the rising cost of holidays abroad and by the popularity of British travel documentaries presented by the likes of Griff Rhys Jones (Griff’s Great Britain) and Julie Walters (Coastal Railways With Julie Walters).Their adventures in the stunning UK countryside are inspiring many to discover what’s on their own doorsteps.Decked out with comfy beds and fancy gadgets, caravanning today is more about comfort rather than getting back to basics.Today’s glitzy state-of-the-art motorhomes can cost well over £100,000.

On this week’s books podcast, the ’s resident thriller fan Alison Flood struggled to finish The Flower Girls, a new thriller by Alice Clark-Platts, the plot of which contains similarities to the James Bulger murder case. This sparked a discussion on the books desk about the books that have most disturbed us: commissioning editor Richard Lea had nightmares after reading Colson Whitehead’s zombie novel Zone One I once had someone hide my copy of American Psycho so I’d stop dwelling on it and associate culture editor Claire Armitstead once destroyed a copy of Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, because she was so disturbed by a particular scene: “I put it in the fire! I have never destroyed another book … but I didn’t want anyone else to read what I’ve read.”On Twitter, readers shared the books that have most disturbed them: Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life was a common choice, as was John Fowles’s The Collector and VC Andrews’s Flowers in the Attic. (Which, as one user tweeted, everyone seems to read far too young.) Others included:Commonly, readers reported having to physically distance themselves from the book itself:What books have most unsettled, shocked or disturbed you, and why?

Due to the reduction and a lack of order backlog with other airlines, Airbus said it would end deliveries of the record-breaking plane in 2021, 14 years after it first entered commercial service.Emirates is yet to take delivery of 14 of the aircraft, parts of which are made in the UK.Airbus said it would “start discussions with its social partners in the next few weeks regarding the 3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years”. The BBC reported around 200 of those jobs are in Britain.The firm said an increase in production of its A320 model would offer “a significant number of internal mobility opportunities”.Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said: “The A380 is not only an outstanding engineering and industrial achievement. Passengers all over the world love to fly on this great aircraft. Hence today’s announcement is painful for us and the A380 communities worldwide.“But keep in mind that A380s will still roam the skies for many years to come and Airbus will of course continue to fully support the A380 operators.”Airbus said Emirates had chosen to reduce its order of A380s from 162 to 123 aircraft following a “review of its operations, and in light of developments in aircraft and engine technologies”. Meanwhile the UAE carrier is buying more of the smaller A330-900 and A350-900 aircraft, purchasing 40 and 30 respectively.“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,” Enders said. “This leads to the end of A380 deliveries in 2021. The consequences of this decision are largely embedded in our 2018 full year results.”The Emirates order for the A330-900 and A350-900 is worth £16.6bn.Airbus said it forecasts similar profits in 2019, in line with growth in the world economy and air traffic.Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said: “While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation. For us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates. We have shown how people can truly fly better on the A380.”The A380 has been a favorite of Emirates passengers, especially those in business and first class, which encompassed the entire upper deck of the airplane and was complete with a bar in the back.Airbus had hoped the A380 would squeeze out Boeing’s 747 and revolutionise air travel as more people take to the skies. Instead, airlines have been cautious about committing to the costly plane, so huge that airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The double-decker planes started flying in 2008 and seated more than 500 passengers.The A380 had troubles from the start, including tensions between the French and German management of Airbus, and protracted production delays and cost overruns. Those prompted a company restructuring that cost thousands of jobs.Industry experts initially expected A380s to long outlast the 747, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year. When it started taking on passengers in 2008, the A380 was hailed for its roominess, large windows, high ceilings and quieter engines. Some carriers put in showers, lounges, duty free shops and bars on both decks.With the Press Association and AFP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cab3748762df44eabce7635c79b83215b7dc22c/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b9dd2c810a93e7c80be6b5399810c9b","title":"uk estate agents house prices are at their gloomiest for 10 years says rics","story":"Expectations, demand and sales expectations all down in latest market snapshotBrexit uncertainty and a lack of affordability in some areas continue to stifle the UK housing market, leaving Britain’s estate agentswith their gloomiest view of property values in 10 years.The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) shows a further weakening of the market, with demand, prices and sales expectations all down.The most downbeat responses to the survey continued to come from London and the south-east, followed by East Anglia and the south-west. These regions have experienced strong price growth over the past six years, which has stretched affordability, and the high prices are a key factor putting off would-be buyers, Rics said. The Rics prices balance has been negative or flat since July 2017, while sales expectations have been in negative territory since August 2018.Surveyors and estate agents have, however, become more optimistic since December about prices and sales over the next 12 months. Northern Ireland and Scotland, property values continue to rise, have the strongest price expectations for the coming year, followed by the north-west and Wales. In London, however, they expect prices to fall.Simon Bainbridge at Savills in Darlington said there had been plenty of positive activity despite Brexit uncertainty, although “there are prospective buyers openly admitting they await the Brexit outcome”.The average time it takes to sell a property, from listing to completion, has reached 19.4 weeks, the longest since this data series was introduced in 2017.David Knights of David Brown \u0026amp Co in Ipswich said: “There was the normal ‘bounce’ in the market expected in January with a good number of viewings and offers, but this did not last and coinciding with the reopening of the Brexit negotiations, we witnessed a slowing down in the last 10 days of the month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af4cc84ca81e178320b1363aef9b7a527e3002f/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b674b79cbdb25a0a0a16b4d89c3dd742","title":"cat ladders a creative solution for felines in flats in pictures","story":"Strategically placed ramps and ladders for urban cats are all the rage in Bern.

Brave iniduals such as Maria Ressa in the Philippines need our supportThe arrest in the Philippines of the courageous journalist Maria Ressa, founder and head of the news organisation Rappler, is a disgrace. It is also one she foresaw. Rodrigo Duterte and his supporters have shown little tolerance for anyone attempting to hold him to account, as Rappler has done, in particular over the “war on drugs” which has killed thousands. Ressa is accused of cyber-libel under a law introduced months after the alleged offence. She previously had to post bail over tax fraud charges which she said were trumped up to harass and intimidate Rappler. Its licence has been revoked and its political correspondent barred from presidential palace briefings.Ressa has called the campaign against Rappler a kind of back-handed compliment: it shows that the president sees it as a threat. Powerful interests at all levels, and those who bolster them, have reason to bully critics into silence. The Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was one of 80 journalists killed last year, while hundreds more were locked up. A Ghanaian journalist who exposed football corruption was shot dead in January. Two Afghan journalists were murdered in their radio station last week. Many more are silenced by violence, threats, harassment or jail. In Myanmar, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have lost their appeal against seven-year sentences for reporting on a military-led massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.This week, a BBC cameraman was violently shoved and abused at a Donald Trump rally. While a White House statement subsequently condemned violence, the US president recently praised Congressman Greg Gianforte for his assault on a  reporter. His attacks on “fake news” are echoed by authoritarians including Mr Duterte. As the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists has warned, Mr Trump’s hostility to and undermining of journalists has global as well as domestic repercussions, normalising press freedom abuses. The Czech president, Miloš Zeman, said last year that: “It hasn’t yet been possible to wipe out Czech journalists.” The Council of Europe called 2018 the worst year for press freedom since the end of the cold war.The work of reputable journalists is all the more vital in an age when lies can spread so rapidly across social media, and when powerful players weaponise such platforms to attack critics, as Ressa has noted. The increasing pressure on journalists, and the need for accurate sources of news, has spurred a Foreign Office campaign in support of media freedom this year – launched, notably, by the British ambassador to the Philippines. The government will host an international conference on protecting journalists in July and has pledged to “increase the costs” of impinging on media freedoms.The campaign and promise are very welcome: rhetoric matters. But so does consistency. It is admirable that the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, raised Khashoggi’s death while in Riyadh last year less so that, as he did so, lower-level British officials continued to talk trade. Receiving another award last year, Ressa said of Rappler’s fortitude: “You don’t really know who you are until you’re forced to fight to defend it … We will hold the line.” Those who profess to care about media freedom must do likewise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d059b9e17ea1ba9b838bcdd8ae622edc77076cf1/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3513ef111da455ec260d9ccc2265122","title":"why even lesbianism and bunnies couldnt make me love the favourite","story":"As a gay woman, I’m expected to be fascinated by a royal period drama with lesbian love triangle, but I don’t see what the fuss is aboutFor weeks people have been telling me how great The Favourite is. “You must see it!” they say. “You’ll love it!” they say. “It deserves so many Oscars!”I don’t really keep up with what’s on at the cinema, as I have a very busy Netflix schedule to attend to. So I found all the Favourite buzz somewhat baffling, particularly as random people kept telling me, with knowing smiles, how much I’d like it. Eventually, I discovered that the film is a royal period drama featuring a demented lesbian love triangle and, suddenly, everything made sense. Because I’m gay, people had the audacity to assume I would automatically love a movie containing Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman cavorting in scenes of a homosexual nature. Which, I mean, yeah, fair enough. I bought a ticket immediately.Like everyone else in the world, I have now seen The Favourite and, well, I have some opinions. Namely, what is all the fuss about? Why on earth did this fairly mediocre film sweep the board at the Baftas, and why has it been nominated for 10 Oscars? I mean, it wasn’t bad: the acting was brilliant and there were some hilarious moments. It was fun it just wasn’t amazing. The weirdness everyone was raving about seemed rather self-indulgent. And while I’m sure there was a deep and meaningful reason for using the fisheye lens so much, it felt as if the director had got a fisheye lens for Christmas and couldn’t stop playing with it. As for the weird rabbit stuff … well, actually, I liked the rabbits. The rabbits were good. I wouldn’t mind if the rabbits got an Oscar.For a while, I fretted about my muted response to the movie. I wondered if I had missed something. I combed through the many rapturous reviews trying to understand the film’s appeal. The Evening Standard told me there was “no doubting the genius of Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama”, but I just kept doubting and doubting. Why, I wondered, could I not seem to see the genius so many other people saw? Perhaps I needed a fisheye lens.Having spent some more time thinking upon the matter, I have arrived at a number of theories. My first is generously self-effacing. Namely, that I have the cinematic palate of a small, rather stupid child. After all, my favourite film is Fast \u0026amp Furious 6, and my second favourite film is Furious 7. But, then again, those are both objectively excellent movies.My second theory is that if you combine period drama and lesbianism with borderline psychopathic characters, then people automatically think: “Ooh, very artsy, very highbrow, I should probably like it.” Not to mention, we all know that a surefire way to get an Academy Award nod is to put some melancholy homosexuality in your movie. More than 50 straight actors have had Oscar nominations for playing LGBT roles and a lot of these actors play queer people who meet with fairly grim endings. Do you think anyone would be raving about The Favourite if it had involved a demented heterosexual love triangle? Because I don’t.My third theory is that nobody really cares about The Favourite at all they just want an excuse to talk about Queen Anne’s sex life. Which, frankly, I find rather unpatriotic. My fourth and final theory is that its appeal has something to do with Brexit. Because, let’s face it, there’s a Brexit angle to everything now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb8a4bfed86ac44788b76ead3591ae5e2288e0b/0_81_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c8203a415909e823cd24d2cbdd6baf","title":"remain theresa may brexit deal article 50","story":"Although some plans are being talked up and others talked down, Theresa May knows everything is still to play forEven at the best of times, politics can be a place of deception and a hall of mirrors. High politics and low calculation are inseparable in the way MPs cast their votes. For some of us, that’s part of what makes politics so fascinating. But, over Brexit, the mirrors glint and deceive more than ever.As the Commons prepares for yet another day’s voting on Brexit today, with more votes to come later this month and in March, this always needs remembering. Today’s votes are skirmishes in a campaign of positioning, not the full battle. Thus far, none of the big Commons votes have meant precisely what they may appear to mean.The most prominent example illustrates this. Theresa May’s deal with the EU was massively trashed in the Commons on 15 January by 230 votes. Yet many Conservative MPs voted against it in the full knowledge that it was not the final word on the subject. Two weeks later, most of them lined up behind the so-called Brady amendment, which gives the bulk of May’s original deal a second chance.Amid the fog of the conflict, it can be tempting to assume that more has been settled in the politics of Brexit than is the case. The reality is that most of the big options, and some small ones, are still in play. Just as May’s deal may yet survive largely intact, complete with a version of the Northern Ireland backstop, so other options that stretch from a Norway-style soft Brexit to an exit without a deal – all of which have their supporters at Westminster – cannot be ruled out.The underlying reasons for this uncertainty are unchanged too. The European issue is huge, complex and isive. Parliament and government are still struggling to adjust to a referendum vote they mostly do not support and which is not easy to implement. And we have a hung parliament. The combination is a recipe for instability and uncertainty. Ever since the vote for the Brady amendment on 29 January, May has claimed that she has a “substantial and sustainable” majority for her attempt to fettle the backstop and get the deal through the Commons. Well, of course she says that. It’s in her interest. She wants to weaken the will of her rebels.But that does not make it true. The majority for Brady was a single frame from a moving film. The movie has already moved on. May’s motion for today’s debate got into trouble with the Tory rebels yesterday precisely because it acknowledges another truth – that there is also a Westminster majority against no deal – that the rebels will not accept. Substantial majority? Pull the other one.That is the same reason why reports of the death of the Cooper-Boles amendment have also been premature and exaggerated. That amendment, which proposed an extension to the article 50 process to prevent a no-deal Brexit, went down by 23 votes two weeks ago. One of the reasons it fell, however, is that 24 Labour MPs voted against it or abstained. Some of them did so, in part, because they didn’t want to be tarred with voting to prolong Brexit when, in fact, it may be prolonged anyway – exactly as the UK’s chief negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard predicting this week.Whatever happens in the Commons tonight, these alternatives not only live to fight another day but may also win in the end. This week, May called on Tory MPs to hold their nerve while she continues her quest for a saleable version of the backstop. But the same advice applies with equal force to the moderates across the Commons who want to emerge with a softer Brexit deal than May has proposed. Their moment could yet come.To say this is not to be in denial. On the contrary, it is to recognise the facts. Looking through the history of Brexit since July 2016 when she became prime minister, three truths can be discerned about May’s approach. The first is that she needs to deliver the least-worst Brexit deal for the country. The second is that she is determined to avoid no-deal. The third is that she wants Brexit to be delivered by the Conservative party and its parliamentary allies.Her problem, all along, is that these three ducks won’t line up. That is extremely unlikely to change. The real problem is that third duck. May remains absolutely Tory-focused on Brexit. But there are not enough Tory and DUP MPs who will vote for the kind of deal she craves. The 15 January rejection, in which 118 Tory MPs voted against her deal, undoubtedly exaggerated the internal opposition. But those 118 will not all come back into line at the end of the month, or in March. Some of them will. Some of them won’t – perhaps including the DUP.In other words, a Brexit deal will only happen with some opposition support. But how much will May need? Not even the chief whip knows. Jeremy Corbyn, who supports Brexit but who wants the Tories to own it, blurs many calculations. Yet not all of the Labour MPs who failed to support Cooper-Boles are supporters of May’s deal. Some them just don’t want to be responsible for an article 50 extension. What is more, they may get their wish, if what Robbins was overheard saying in that Brussels hotel bar on Tuesday night by ITV News’s Angus Walker were to happen.Ever since 29 January, when the Brady amendment was carried and the Cooper-Boles amendment was lost, many have assumed that the die was cast. There is a mood of fatalism in remainer Britain that, after those votes, May is finally going to deliver a Tory-facing Brexit. Yes, that could happen. But the facts and the numbers don’t yet support that view. Facts and numbers still count for a lot, even in a hall of mirrors. But leadership counts for even more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296d6afc45a558c71500ef2d74e3a7e6cb5b3f11/0_274_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a24ce53b114150c23e134a2e69297ba","title":"the best valentine gift not having to buy one at all","story":"Whatever you buy will be loaded with misunderstanding. Better to arrive at a point where you no longer need to buy anything at allValentine’s Day is an exciting time of the year, when marketing departments across the land scramble to take an entirely loveless product and give it a romantic spin. Suggestions this year include gifting your loved one an entry in a Tough Mudder race – for real, you give himher a token to scramble over a set of obstacles, because nothing says “I care” like “I’m worried about your fitness levels”. Elsewhere, there is a discount on waxing services, the circuitous generosity logic being that you will be able to give the gift of your own hairlessness.They assail you like this because they know you are desperate. The ideal Valentine’s gift is extremely cheap, since money besmirches emotion, and also, if you outrank in value whatever you have been bought yourself, you instigate a future Valentine’s arms race.Expense depersonalises: think a wallet, roses, perfume or a pen. All regular fallback options – meat, booze, cheese, socks – carry the taint of evanescence: “Dear loved one, hopefully we will last longer than this gift.” Cheap things, however, must be planned or they look incredibly random, like the ice bucket in the shape of a pineapple that someone bought me once, and I still haven’t stopped going on about, seven relationships and 20 years later.

Much of this is carried out in the COAST lab, a state-of-the-art facility that enables researchers to test and model how new devices, such as floating wind turbines, are affected by waves, currents and wind.It’s an important international testing ground. Hybrid offshore arrays, which combine wind and wave, are currently being tested at the facility, as are offshore structures that not only convert waves into energy but also protect the coast from erosion.“A lot of new ideas are coming through around wave and tidal,” says Greaves. “For the wave energy industry there is a huge prize out there it’s a massive resource and will be an important part of renewable energy in the future.”The university also “hires” out the lab to businesses and research groups, which gives students a chance to work closely with industry pioneers, often leading to placements and even future employment. “We really want all of these activities – teaching, research and commercial work – to feed into one another,” says Greaves.In addition to its world-leading facilities, the university is part of a number of national and international collaborations driving offshore renewables to the next level. MaRINET2 is a €10.5m European commission initiative through which the lab is offered free of charge to projects looking to test their ideas in real-world conditions.Greaves, who was recently awarded an OBE for her contributions to research into offshore renewable energy, also heads up the influential Supergen ORE Hub, a consortium of 10 universities with industry and policy stakeholders to champion and maintain the UK’s world-leading expertise in ORE. It aims to pull together the related areas of wave, tidal and offshore wind, to address challenges at a national level, and improve R\u0026ampD cooperation. The initiative is supported by UK government and industry, and has been backed with £5m of funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.She is also founding chair of the Partnership for Research in Marine Renewable Energy (PRIMaRE), which has brought together experts from across higher education, research and industry to establish a “network of excellence”.Last year, the university opened its dedicated School of Engineering, which is home to its ORE research and has experts in control, structures, civil and materials engineering – all crucial aspects in the design of ORE structures.“A key to the university’s success in this area is its ability to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, combining the environmental and marine biology aspects with the engineering,” says Greaves. “I think that comes very naturally … and that’s definitely an advantage.”While its expertise in marine renewables is well-known, it is also developing innovative ideas around solar power. PulsiV Solar is a spinout venture set up by Dr Mohammed Zaki Ahmed, an associate professor in the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics.Ahmed, a graduate of the university, is currently working on two ideas that could have major implications for renewable energy, and which came about as he looked for new ways to teach and inspire his students.“Rather than just teaching out of a textbook, I started looking at building some practical experience in solar,” he explains. “In the process, I discovered that there was a whole area of solar energy harvesting that wasn’t really being investigated.”His research is investigating ways to pulse photovoltaic panels and draw their power in bursts rather than continuously, which can lead to the sun’s energy being captured more efficiently.But the innovation doesn’t end there. Working with his postgraduate students, Ahmed has also discovered that the same electronics principles used on the LED, but working in reverse, can be used to extract more energy from wind turbines, especially when the wind is erratic.The superfast electronics have been shown to react 30 times quicker to changing conditions, says Ahmed, whose innovations have earned two patents in the United States. “It is potentially disruptive technology and has amazed those who have seen it work.”Geothermal energy – in which steam from water naturally found in hot, often volcanic, rocks, is used to drive turbines and produce electricity and heat – is another area of research for the university.In partnership with the British Geological Survey and private companies GEL and Geoscience Ltd, Plymouth is involved with the United Downs Project, a European Research Development Fund (ERDF) project in Cornwall – both on the technical side and in assessing public responses to it.“This project is just one in which we are breaking new, interdisciplinary ground,” explains Iain Stewart MBE, professor of geoscience communication and director of the university’s Sustainable Earth Institute. “In this case, we’re mixing geologists, psychologists, sociologists and communication professionals to understand how the geotechnical challenges gain social acceptance among local communities.”University students involved in the project have gone on to study for PhDs in the very specialist research field of geothermal energy. “So Plymouth’s involvement in this world-leading project is feeding back to the students,” says Stewart.Dr Hazel Gibson, who recently finished her PhD at Plymouth, now works as a research fellow in public perception of geothermal power, finding out how much people really know about new and unfamiliar technologies, and how these views could affect future rollout.“When we are looking at renewable energy issues in modern society, the problems are always more complicated than just figuring out the technical questions,” she explains. “They involve dealing with aspects of society, and politics, and the economy that are often overlooked by technical experts.“What we are doing at Plymouth is quite unique, because we are not separating science from society – we are putting these two things together. Sustainability isn’t just about science, it’s about people. Projects such as this are a great opportunity for us to use our geological skills, but to do it in an environmentally and socially responsible way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c824dffd24a89fde1df8201c41f426e2dbc0274d/545_711_5215_3129/master/5215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c1731437f8752d23af32b8b99407c7c","title":"universities stamp out creativity are graduates ready for work","story":"Universities are changing the way they teach to prepare students for a future in which lots of jobs will be automatedA few numbers are enough to sum up how far the world of work is changing. More than six million workers fear their jobs could be replaced by machines in the next 10 years. Around 1.1 million people now work in the gig economy, using online platforms to find small, often on-demand, jobs. And a third of graduates find themselves mismatched to the jobs they secure on graduation.What universities can do to prepare their graduates for an unknown future was the subject of a roundtable, sponsored by HSBC, held in Birmingham last week and attended by senior academic leaders, employers and policy-makers.It emerged that the numbers did not paint the full picture. Take automation: Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, pointed out that automation did not necessarily mean fewer jobs – just different ones. And politicians were wrong to assume that these would largely be in programming in fact, programming was likely to be automated in future, while more creative skills would still be in demand. “The key thing is to enable people to reskill and move around the job market in a more nimble way than they currently can do,” he said.Paul Faulkner, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, questioned the idea that an ever-changing, unknown jobs future was something new. “Every generation will have felt that way.”Were students graduating without the skills needed by employers? It was important not to confuse learning skills with content that becomes quickly outdated, said Kathy Armour, pro vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Birmingham, while Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University, said content matters but mainly as “the context around which you can develop skills and attributes”.The consensus was that whatever the future of work looked like, it would demand creativity.Julie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west England, stressed the importance of including arts in the emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as key subjects, so that Stem becomes Steam. Parents who advised their children that taking arts subjects would harm their job prospects were making a mistake, she said.Yvonne Brown, senior lecturer in management and human resources at Coventry University, said universities needed to ensure the way they assessed students encouraged teamwork and a creative approach to learning. It wasn’t just creativity that employers looked for, added Graham Thompsett, people capability director at Jaguar Land Rover – it was also curiosity. “There isn’t enough of that.”Mike Rowley, partner and head of education at KPMG, said his company did not focus on a particular degree or content but on softer skills, which he argued should be taught to students at an earlier stage in the education system.Work experience was essential in developing these skills, speakers agreed. Professor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, said work placements or experiential learning were invaluable in closing attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Not everyone approached the world of work from the same starting point: many students at Birmingham City came from deprived backgrounds and even short placements could help demystify office life and behaviour. “We talk about preparing students for an unknown future,” he said. “For a lot of my students it’s an unknown present.”Work placements had another value too – in preserving students’ innate abilities. “I think sometimes universities inadvertently stamp out creativity,” he suggested. “I have watched law students coming in with oodles of common sense from their everyday lives. You start teaching them and within about a year they can give you a lecture on contract law, but can’t solve a problem any more they could probably have solved when they came in.”Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said another way of equipping students with transferable skills was enabling them to work closely with researchers to become independent learners and researchers in their own right.But students needed to pick up more than learning skills from universities to have successful careers, argued Frances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking Midlands Region, at HSBC. “Another thing that’s really important is around building the strength and skills of iniduals to manage mental wellbeing,” she said. Jason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies at the University of Warwick, said students felt they were paying a lot of money to be at university and that had changed attitudes towards the skills institutions needed to deliver.But it was not all up to universities, said Thompsett. Employers needed to change too. This meant working more closely with universities to develop skills and find suitable – and erse – recruits.Plowden said he would “vehemently disagree” with any suggestion that universities were just about getting a job. But for Cameron it was “base level hygiene”. While he appreciated the sense of civic engagement, morals and values he derived from his university education, his ability to appreciate it all had been underpinned by the fact that he was employed, and universities failed their students if they did not give them that opportunity.For Sandy Lindsay, founder and chair at the communications consultancy Tangerine, apprenticeships offered one solution. She set up the Juice Academy, a digital marketing apprenticeship programme, because she felt digital marketing was too fast-changing to be taught at the slow pace of a university setting.Yet she felt the government’s current apprenticeship programme was a missed opportunity, lacking essential flexibility. And Plowden agreed that the bureaucracy involved was such that the apprenticeship system “makes us look like Usain Bolt”.Slowness was particularly problematic in the pace of change on ersity, argued Arday. He was concerned at the persistent attainment gap between white and black and minority ethnic students and felt this was reinforced by the dearth of people of colour in leadership positions in universities or industry. “We don’t have a model reflective of the student population,” he argued.But while many agreed that universities needed to be faster at responding to change, the solution was not just extra speed, countered Armour. She made the case for “slow learning”, rejecting the government’s enthusiasm for accelerated two-year courses in favour of a more modular approach, interspersed with periods of work. Why do we study for three years, she asked, rather than seven? “The idea that you will be able at 18 to study something and three years later you’ll have everything you need to take you through until you’re 75 is fanciful. If it ever were true it’s certainly not true now.”She predicted that universities would remain trusted providers of education but there would be new ways to package material into microchunks. Only a few years ago, music lovers could only buy records on an LP, but now most young people buy bits and pieces through iTunes, she said. “You can see a lot of students who might want to package their learning somewhat differently over a life course,” she said. “That seems to me where the future is.”Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive professor of Aston UniversitySandy Lindsay, founder and chair at Tangerine \u0026amp The Juice AcademyFrances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking, Midlands Region, HSBCPaul Faulkner, CEO, Birmingham Chamber of CommerceJulie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west EnglandMichael Rowley, partner and head of education, KPMGProfessor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City UniversityProfessor Kathy Armour, pro-vice-chancellor (education), University of BirminghamGraham Thompsett, people capability director, Jaguar Land RoverYvonne Browne, senior lecturer in management and human resources, Coventry University LondonJason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies, University of WarwickSarah Stevens, head of policy, the Russell Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72a75f26de1130eac3446edc7651aee3e0ef27/0_391_5834_3501/master/5834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35449bf0c421b8592eeb9ea7bda6e228","title":"wildlife photographer year people choice winner in pictures","story":"David Lloyd’s Bond of Brothers, a heartwarming image of an affectionate pair of male lions, has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Lumix people’s choice award.

Being rich, wanting to be rich and wanting to stay rich are desires that are all immersed in a champagne punchbowl of musical-comedy fantasy innocence. All the cynicism is removed and replaced with something childlike.The Lady Eve is a film that sports with events in the Garden of Eden. It is a world away from unpleasantness. Or almost. When someone does a Hitler impression to show what dishonesty looks like, the historical context is restored with a jolt.Stanwyck supplies a bravura double performance, a showcase for her brilliant versatility. She is Jean, a woman of mystery aboard a cruise ship who is travelling with her portly father, “Colonel” Harrington, played by Charles Coburn. They are a daddy-daughter team of professional gamblers and cheats who rook unsuspecting fellow passengers over the card tables after dinner. In their sights is Charles Pike, played by Henry Fonda: clumsy, shy and as unworldly as any debutante.Charles is a biologist and naturalist, and he has in a basket in his cabin a previously undiscovered species of snake found on a recent trip to the Amazon, but he is also the heir to his father’s staggering brewery fortune, based on the bestselling Pike Ale – “The Ale That Won For Yale”. (Nowadays, Yale University would guard its trademark a bit better than that.) The snake will keep escaping.Poor Charles is someone Jean would ordinarily eat for lunch. But he is just so charming that she falls in love with him – to her dad’s astonished disapproval – and proposes to grab all his money the legitimate way instead: by getting married. But things go awry and then Charles succeeds in hurting Jean’s feelings, so she hatches an outrageously complex plan: to pose as someone else, a drawling Brit aristocrat called “the Lady Eve”, and break Charles’s heart, so that humble card-sharping Jean is going to look the soul of decency.Cheating at cards could well be a satirical metaphor for the marriageorce racket, with “Colonel” Harrington giving the bride away to every sucker whose money is about to be removed. But Sturges is also giving us a wacky Book of Genesis. When Jean goes to Charles’s cabin and encounters his snake, it’s of biblical as well as Freudian significance. She is nervous and obscurely impressed by it. Who is eating from the tree of knowledge, though? Charles is stunned to discover the truth about Jean, and Jean is hurt to find that man she loves is cold and unforgiving. And who is God the father? Is it Harrington? Or is it Charles’s father, the insensitive beer magnate, played by corpulent Eugene Pallette. In this Wodehousian world, crooks are always pretending to be British blue-bloods, but in a spirit of honest homage to how classy the Brits are fondly imagined to be. Amusingly, Coburn would himself play a British nobleman, Sir Francis “Piggy” Beekman, on board a cruise ship full of eligible millionaires in a comparable comedy of gold-digging: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, from 1953.The dialogue scenes between Stanwyck and Fonda are tremendous, particularly when they are repeatedly interrupted by a nuzzling horse. In fact, Stanwyck completely upstages Fonda who looks as delicate as a Lalique vase. Her chemistry is more with the dads: with Coburn and Pallette. She is the real thoroughbred."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Celtic progressed to this last-32 tie in the Europa League after emerging from a group in which RB Leipzig were left behind.“This is a challenge for us,” Rodgers said. “I said to the players this morning: ‘Listen, we are playing against a good team, everyone recognises that, but let’s not forget we’re a good team as well.’ That’s why we are at this stage of the competition. We are through on merit. We had good teams in our group and we qualified. We deserve it. So let’s go and attack the game and enjoy it.“You are just trying to constantly reinforce the belief. Sometimes you don’t play well and if you don’t play well against teams like Valencia you get hurt. But that’s always a constant. The players arrive into this game having been playing well – their commitment in the games has been very good.”Since the turn of the year, Celtic have won seven domestic fixtures in succession without conceding a goal. Their task, quite obviously, is to adapt from matches in which they dominate possession towards handling a La Liga side. Valencia are eighth in Spain’s top tier, where they have only lost four games.“Valencia is a club I know well,” Rodgers said. “They have a great history and there is always a demand to do well. They have very good players and some of their recent results tell you everything about the level they are at. But it’s an opportunity for us. I never see a good team as an obstacle. No matter how good they are or how much money they have, they can’t put 12 players out there. It’s 11 v 11 and we have to give everything we can to get a result. The longer we are together, the more experience the players are getting.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSixteen season have almost passed since Celtic reached the Uefa Cup final under Martin O’Neill. Interim accounts this week showed Rodgers has presided over a business in rude health – the club had £38m in the bank at the end of 2018 – but the manager was circumspect over whether the Scottish champions can ever emulate the run of 2002-03.“You always have to believe you can,” he said. “I think if you look at the teams in it, there’s a real array of top teams.“The competition gets stronger each year because now there is a real onus on it where you can qualify for the Champions League. Because of that there is a real hunger there for teams to do well in it. But you always have to go in and do the very best you possibly can, that’s the idea. And that’s what we’ll always believe.”Key to Celtic’s attacking hopes will be Oliver Burke, the West Brom loanee who has seen his career reinvigorated since moving north of the border. The 21-year-old had struggled elsewhere despite moving for combined fees of close to £30m.“There’s a perception of him,” Rodgers added. “If you dig deep you’ll find out. Some players aren’t learners and they will struggle. The one thing I found with him is that when I spoke to him on the phone I felt there was a hunger to improve.“He’d been on the sidelines for a while and I loved his strengths.

Because of his intention I made a quick movement and the ball bounced on my arm. It was an unlucky goal for me to concede but when I saw the screen I saw a possible offside.“I think it was the correct decision and luckily for us there was VAR because otherwise nobody would have seen it.”The controversial decision meant Real went in at half-time on level terms with all three goals coming in the second half. Karim Benzema was earlier on target for Real but the reigning champions, seeking a fourth straight title, were given a major scare by the only team left in the competition who had to come through qualifying.As well as the disallowed goal Tadic also hit a post and Ajax were full value for their equaliser scored by Hakim Ziyech.

Marcos Alonso, who endured a torrid afternoon against the champions and was culpable in the lack of marking for City’s opening goal, has been omitted from the travelling squad, though Sarri claimed he had been rested rather than dropped.The head coach returned to a familiar theme when addressing his team’s capitulation at the Etihad Stadium, suggesting their performance had disintegrated from the moment City gained the ascendancy, though he could offer no real evidence as to how to avoid a repeat.“We talked all together for one hour the day after the match,” said Sarri. “But I think that it’s better to work. Better to react on the pitch. It’s not been too easy this week, of course, but after a match like Manchester City, that’s normal.“It’s not easy to play tomorrow after a 6-0 but we have to play and we have to play well. We want to win and react immediately. In my opinion the last game was not a problem of motivation. We were not able to react to the first difficulty during the match because, in the first four or five minutes, we’d actually started well. Then, after their first goal, we were not able to react. So the problem is different. But it’s always a mind problem, a mental problem, so we need to solve them.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSarri, seven months into a three-year deal at Stamford Bridge, was watched by the chairman, Bruce Buck, from the audience as he conducted his pre-match media duties on the eve of the first leg against Malmö. The Italian distanced himself from suggestions made to Italian television that he would welcome more direct contact with Roman Abramovich and stressed he was happy using the director, Marina Granovskaia, as a conduit to the owner.Granovskaia was instrumental in his appointment over the summer and, while Abramovich would always make the final decision on the head coach’s future, the sense is there is no great appetite to instigate a mid-season change of management.Yet the hierarchy will expect to see evidence of improvement, meaning the next few weeks will in effect determine Sarri’s future at the club. Chelsea are still competing in three cup competitions and are only a point off the top four in the Premier League but, if their campaign unravels over the rest of this month, change would seem inevitable, whether in March or at the end of the campaign.The forward Pedro insisted the players had grasped the tactical nuances Sarri has been impressing on them. “Press really high, stay compact, create chances with good possession, a lot of the ball,” he said. “We can do this as a team. But sometimes it’s so difficult to play in this way depending on the opponents. City played very well, so it was so difficult to press, create between the lines, and to defend.”The tie in Sweden is a 20,500 sell-out with the hosts, coached by the former City striker and Brentford and Leeds manager Uwe Rösler intent on an upset despite not having played a competitive game since November. Malmö have played five friendlies, including one against a local amateur team and two in Marbella during a training camp, in the build-up to this fixture having emerged from their group at Besiktas’ expense.They have not lost a home game in European competition since PSG trounced them 5-0 in the Champions League group stage in 2015. “But the higher you climb the mountain, the thinner the air gets,” said Rosler. “It gets more difficult. The mindset is ‘no respect’. We have to be aggressive with and without the ball. We have a plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a8f6aab10c1c6485929451ef3552827dfcf97a/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=483fc3b85c67f6308f1d6e395d86894e","title":"petr cech arsenal europa league bate borisov","story":"• Arsenal goalkeeper outlines his ‘ideal scenario’ • Opponents Bate Borisov have not played since DecemberAfter Arsenal landed in Belarus to begin the knockout stages of the Europa League against Bate Borisov, their goalkeeper Petr Cech, who retires at the end of the season, outlined his dream to bid farewell by winning the trophy.“That would be an ideal scenario for me to finish my career,” he said. “We prepare every day for every competition and this is what we are aiming for. We try to win every game and progress step by step and as a club it is important for us to try to go as far as possible.“Winning the Europa League is a great memory for everyone involved and secondly it can book you a place in the Champions League, so you can see there is a lot to play for.”Cech, whose career has included 14 trophies and the accolade of being the most capped Czech footballer with 124 appearances, intends to savour every moment he gets on the pitch this season and give every last ounce of professionalism he has.“I don’t think if it is my last game or not,” he said. “I prepare for every game like I did all through my career and I want to put the best performance on the pitch and win the game.”With Bernd Leno taking over Premier League duties for Arsenal, the 36-year-old Cech is adopting the role of cup keeper and is highly focused on trying to help Arsenal go even further than they did last season in the Europa League, when they were beaten by the eventual winners, Atlético Madrid, in the semi-finals.Cech is urging his team to step up a gear after a canter through the group stage. “We are the favourites for the tie but you have to do it on the pitch, be focused home and away, if you want to progress,” he said.Unai Emery has brought a strong squad for the game against Bate Borisov. Pierre Emerick Aubameyang returns after illness but Mesut Özil, who was also off colour last weekend, did not make enough of a recovery to make the journey.Now Arsenal are out of both domestic cups, and with the search for a top-four finish an uncertain route back into the Champions League, the Europa League holds major significance in their ambitions for the remainder of the season.“Our target is clear: to play next year in the Champions League,” Emery said. “But we know it’s not easy. We have two ways now, one is the Europa League, and to win it is very difficult. In the Premier League we also have the possibility. The big challenge is thinking only about the next match, improving inidually and collectively, creating a big mentality for us.”They take on a Bate team who have not played since December. They are in their pre-season and have had an overhaul of their squad, with seven departures and three players coming in. The midfielder Alexander Hleb, once of north London, is still playing at the age of 37.Arsenal struck 10 goals past Bate when the teams met last season but they are taking nothing for granted. “Bate are involved in European competition every year and have a lot of experience playing in Europe, so it is not going to be easy,” Cech said.Emery was also keen to point out that, even if it is snood weather, the conditions will not in any way phase Arsenal. When Chelsea visited last December Maurizio Sarri was not too impressed with the state of the pitch in the chilly Borisov Arena in Barysaw.“We played against Vorskla in Kiev when it was snowing,” Emery said. “It’s not an excuse for us, the weather or the pitch. We play 90 minutes that are the same for them and for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27bbf9b0d0daa06509a2a4754fcd1c587b3b777a/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb389ec78b5ae255879f3efbe6727616","title":"four day working week share your experiences and views","story":"We would like to explore the idea from your perspective, whether you are an employee, employer or policy expertMoving to a four day week: is it the ideal way to achieve a better work-life balance or simply a luxury incompatible with the modern world?

Perhaps that’s about to changeFor the last decade, Marina – formerly Marina and the Diamonds – has sat on the precarious fence between mainstream and underground pop: someone with that curious, 21st-century kind of fame where you can rack up tens of millions of streams without ever having a Top 10 single. The Welsh native’s first solo work in four years, Handmade Heaven, was released last Friday – can it finally be the song to give her universal appeal?Peter Robinson, editor of the influential pop music site Popjustice, says Marina excels in a particular manner: while “certain music comes in and out of fashion, it’s a rare artist who does exactly what they want to a high standard”. He describes her as “one of the top three British artists – it’s a shame we don’t cherish her more.”With every album Marina, now 33, has offered a different persona, focus and tone, attracting and dismaying fans and critics with each change. Her first album, The Family Jewels, in 2010, was written mainly by her – rough around the edges but unapologetically honest and autobiographical. It had a range of styles, from two ethereal piano-driven tracks, Obsessions and I’m Not a Robot, which address OCD tendencies and social isolation, to songs with poppier aspirations discussing wider societal issues. Take a look at the song Girls: “Girls are not meant to fight dirty  Never look a day past 30  I’ll never bend over and curtsey for you”: assertive, sarcastic lyrics backed by spine-chilling synthesisers and haunting laughter.This strikingly stylised voice contrasted starkly against the tedious ballad singers who had begun dominating the charts, such as Adele and Sam Smith. The album earned her second place in BBC’s Sound of 2010 after Ellie Goulding, and granted Marina her most successful single to date, Hollywood, peaking at No 12.Marina’s lyrics made it very clear that from the beginning, she had even greater aspirations. In the opener, Are You Satisfied?, she sings: “They say I am a control freak  Driven by a greed to succeed”, a message she repeats – perhaps ironically – on Oh No: “Don’t do love, don’t do friends  I’m only after success”.It just didn’t suit her: Lana Del Rey could pull off the tragic, toxic heroine much more effectively, combining nostalgic glamour with 20th-century Americana in a singular focused image. Marina’s persona – self-aggrandising yet coquettish – complicated the mix trying to portray a female character who is defined by the male gaze made any self-identification confusing. She said: “I felt like I was being pushed into it”, and told the Oxford Union: “I hated how there was an expectation for your iniduality to be ironed out in order to succeed … I was working in the wrong place.”How refreshing it was, then, when she returned in 2015 to write all the tracks for her third album Froot, herself, and with a more mature and self-aware approach. Some of the song names alone – Happy, Forget and Can’t Pin Me Down – show her new attitude. In Gold, she even addressed how misperceived she was in the pop industry: “They don’t seem to understand who you are  It doesn’t matter as long as you are a star.”Rolling Stone magazine criticised her “superfluous songs and cringey lyrics” and interpreted her lyrical commentary on Savages as “misanthropic” and Better Than That as “slut-shaming”. But it wasn’t all bad. As Caroline Sullivan wrote in her review for the : “If you allow yourself to be swept into her world, it’s an intriguing place”, even though “this has yielded a record of intense highs and lows, and a range of styles that don’t always join up well.” Commercially, it was her lowest performing album in the UK, although it went to No 8 in the US.While still lacking cohesion – and a killer hit – Froot was the work of a woman brimming with confidence. This has continued, as she changed her name in late 2018 from Marina and the Diamonds to just Marina. This self-assertion was clear even in the song Hollywood from her first album, whose lyrics relayed a joking exchange: “Oh my god, you look just like Shakira  No no, you’re Catherine Zeta  Actually, my name’s Marina.” After years of being pulled between different versions of herself, the name change suggests she’s now more focused than ever.That’s not to say she is against collaboration. Despite saying in a 2015 BBC article that “co-writing is killing pop music … if you listen to lyrics on any radio station, you don’t find anyone talking about anything deep or provocative”, she has since featured on two of Clean Bandit’s songs. Baby was released last November and peaked at No 15. Disappointingly, it was a generic tale of the one who got away.So does Handmade Heaven suggest an album where she can finally blend popularity with meaning? The song evokes the very frustration she has felt throughout her career: “I carry along a feel of unease  I want to belong like the birds in the trees”, she sings, before finding solace in the handmade heaven of the title: a place she can write her own version of paradise.Whether other people will ever want to enter it is still open to debate, but her sharply insightful worldview is rare in pop and deserves to be heard. Having disposed of all the personae to leave simply Marina, now is the perfect time for her to show her true potential with her next album in April. As Peter Robinson says, “if she doesn’t succeed with this, that’s a problem with pop culture – not a problem with Marina.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d438190efa2c5b9a3a382d9d7aeb0d17f95c14/25_4_5265_3160/master/5265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256ad5978f1f4b25b53f824c64754d0b","title":"sleaford mods webchat post your questions now","story":"The duo’s splenetic frontman gave his opinions on topics including Nottingham, giving up alcohol and hating IdlesJason Williamson, the scabrous frontman of punk duo Sleaford Mods, came into the ’s offices to answer your questions, on everything from his job bagging up marijuana to his strong dislike of Idles. Scroll down to read all of his responses.Thank you very much for sending the questions in - I hope they haven\u0027t depressed you too much. And yeah, I hope you enjoy the new album, if you\u0027re going to buy it.UncleZippy asks: Why are you either so self-deprecating or comically cocky about your work? Did you grow up feeling ashamed about being creative?No, I grew up having no confidence whatsover in my abilities. I had confidence in my ideas but not my abilities. But also, I don\u0027t want to brag about it, I don\u0027t want to appear overly confident about it - I think that\u0027s really offputting.You went to stage school. Can you tell us about that?I did Theatre Studies at A level. I tried to get into Rada, the lot, any that would have me, but I couldn\u0027t get in. I spent a year doing auditions, and I realised it would take another two or three years to get any kind of result –\u0026nbspso I went into music instead.Did you ever visit the old Robin Hood visitor centre in Nottingham? I went in there tripping on shrooms and the papier mache headed Middle Ages blokes sat round in the tavern will last with me forever.No I don\u0027t, no. I\u0027ve never gone in. But that must have been amazing.Would you take on a sponsor for live shows if it meant you could put on the whole lighting rig stuff and video wallsvisuals, or are the crates and laptop a part of your signature?Yeah., we\u0027re not really into visuals. They look terrible. And to be honest I don\u0027t know why other bands haven\u0027t caught onto the idea of not using them. Even having your name behind you is a no-no. The music should carry itself. And I understand that a lot of bands\u0027 music isn\u0027t carried very well, so they need all the help they can get. But we are looking into lighting ideas - people are saying a minimal lighting show could add a nice touch to it. But big stage shows, stupid, they really do take away from it.You’ve not put a foot wrong these last few years – how do you keep pushing forward in such a consistent manner? Admittedly, the utter shitshow we have to endure gives you loads of material, but isn’t that true for every band?Bands have got different agendas, it just so happens that ours is... I don\u0027t know! You can\u0027t put it into words. But it\u0027s nice you think that. A lot of people don\u0027t. It\u0027s loads of different things that have made it what it is.Who cut your hair, the council?Who cut my hair, the council? No. And I\u0027ve not got that haircut any more - the straight fringe is a young person\u0027s game. It\u0027s not something I want to carry into my 50s - it would look like a toupee. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with toupees. I just thought I\u0027d get rid of it.MYCohen asks:1. How important is money?2. What’s your favourite Fall track?How important is money? Of course it\u0027s important. I\u0027ve got a mortgage to pay and we need to eat, and because of that it\u0027s important. If you\u0027re talking about a gig being attractive for a lot of money, it depends - we do a lot of gigs where we don\u0027t earn a lot, and it\u0027s nice to be paid more than you usually do. Would I sell out for £2m quid? No I wouldn\u0027t. Well actually, it depends on the level of sell-out. But as a rule. NoThe Fall: Industrial Estate, I thought that was good. People compare us to them so much, so I don\u0027t listen to them too much in case we pick them up. But god rest his soul - he was a man who stuck to his formula and you\u0027ve got to respect that.Your music is so full of hate, have you ever thought of being constructive for a change? Perhaps sing about solutions, not your spite?No, we don\u0027t sing about solutions. I would find that really patronising. There is no answer. Life is chaotic the human form is chaotic. As Alan Moore once said, we\u0027re speeding towards a brick wall in a fast car. We\u0027re animals. There are no solutions. But this music isn\u0027t hate music at all. It\u0027s good street music. And on the street, it\u0027s never nice. Regular life for the most part is pretty crap, and this is what it talks about.How difficult has it been to keep reacting to events given how fast everything moves now?It hasn\u0027t really. You do an album, and you have a cooling off period, and you start again. And your idea of how you want to communicate that, connects to it. It\u0027s not majorly difficult, you just have to be honest with yourself brush by any notion of addressing something in a cliched or obvious way, and think about how you\u0027re going to propose a point on a stage that is powerful. So no. I\u0027ve got a lot of time to think about it, and after each year we\u0027re ready to start again. It marries itself to current issues, because current issues are still unbelievably bad, and will carry on like that.Hi, I’m a 21 year old that’s grown up poor in the depressing, expensive Tory heartland of Surrey. A lot of my mates are turning very right wing, regurgitating whatever they’ve read from social media, and the heavy lefties seem to be equally shallow and militant. Any help? I can\u0027t give you any help, I\u0027m sorry. I just can\u0027t. What do you do? Just carry on. And try to question everything. It\u0027s interesting you have equal scorn for the left as the right, as that\u0027s how it\u0027s getting - people are just pulling things out of books and saying things for effect. But I don\u0027t have any answers for you, I\u0027m sorry.Do you envisage a time when Sleaford Mods will have run its course, or are you happy to be like the Rolling Stones?I dunno. Not sure. I think me and Andrew constantly think if its decent any more, but every time we record an album, it\u0027s good. It\u0027s not boring yet, but what can you do - I do worry about it a lot, but it\u0027s still good. And it\u0027s only really five years old in a commercial sense. I\u0027ve just got to ignore all that - it\u0027s moved on enough to justify carrying on. We certainly don\u0027t repeat ourselves, and I like to think the subject matter, although it is largely talking about similar themes, is addressed differently on each album. There will come a time where we might feel slightly out of sync, but that hasn\u0027t happened yet. It depends how we play it. The main thing is that we\u0027re honest with ourselves. We\u0027re still really happy with it. It\u0027s bulletproof.Jason, you gave up alcohol a couple of years back. You’ve mentioned that this has helped you get in physical shape. But did it affect your creativity – is writing lyrics harder now? No, it\u0027s easier. Because I haven\u0027t got drug comedowns and hangovers to deal with, I haven\u0027t got guilt to deal with, any what did I do? stuff to deal with. I\u0027m not arguing as much, I\u0027m not paranoid, and every day is nice. I get up and I\u0027m alright. So it\u0027s easier to write stuff and motivate yourself - previously I was languishing in self-pity and utter confusion.How hard is to keep the lyrics real in this time of political correctness when everybody’s so easily offended?Well, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re overtly offensive, apart from swear words and criticism of whoever. I\u0027m sure most of the lyrics get laughed off by whatever target, it\u0027s how it is isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s far more offensive bands to be looking at really, who do keep well within the realms of political correctness. It\u0027s easy - just carry on.Why were you supporting the Who at Hyde Park a few years back? Someone thought you were a mod band perhaps?No - the promoter of the festival was someone who really liked us and asked us to come along. And to be honest, if there was ever a band that was tied in with the idea of it, it would be us - I\u0027ll take that, thank you very much!D’you reckon the Brits are rigged? Or just shit?They\u0027re not rigged - they just don\u0027t let bands in who the label sponsors don\u0027t have a financial interest in. So that\u0027s why it\u0027s not as interesting as it mildly was 25 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b347cbf0236da29cb3581d5e45fcc140fceb1de9/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d18844848b79d1be00a73e7e1c882fd","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

In the 2016 referendum, he came out in favour of remaining in the EU, but was criticised by some for what was seen as a lacklustre campaign.  Now Brexit is threatening to split his party, and many of his MPs and party members feel frustrated by his lack of clarity over the party’s position on Europe. ’s political editor, Heather Stewart, talks to Anushka Asthana about Corbyn’s changing relationship with the EU, while Steve Howell, a former Corbyn adviser and author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks That Transformed British Politics, discusses how Corbyn arrived at his remain and reform position. Plus Alena Ivanova, a Momentum activist, argues that Corbyn’s only option is to listen to party members who want a second referendum.  And: In the year since the mass-shooting in Parkland, Florida, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, have been steadily working to build a political movement. Lois Beckett has been following them.

For a while now, one of the main attractions of prime minister’s questions has been to see if Theresa May can pass the Turing test. On many occasions it has been too close to call whether she can exhibit behaviour and speech patterns that are indistinguishable from a human being. Today she failed miserably, barely even passing herself off as basic artificial intelligence. It can’t be long before all she is capable of doing is letting out intermittent SOS signals.It didn’t help that Jeremy Corbyn had used all six of his questions to lay bare the very obvious inadequacies of Chris Grayling. If, being generous, you assume that the average IQ of the cabinet is 100, then there must be some ministers who qualify as geniuses to compensate for the likes of Failing Grayling, Liam “Easiest Deal in the World” Fox, Gavin “Private Pike” Williamson and Stephen “Know Nothing” Barclay. All four would long since have been sacked for incompetence if they were working anywhere other than Westminster.Though it might have looked as if the Labour leader was going for an easy win by targeting the transport secretary, asking the prime minister to defend Grayling was, in fact, a trick question. Because, were they to answer correctly, even a barely sentient person or a machine of even 1990s-level AI would have to concede Failing Grayling is breathtakingly useless. A politician whose track record of disaster is unparalleled in modern politics.Yet to the Maybot, he is a god. An all-conquering hero who bends the world to his will. Quite why the prime minister is unable to see what is self-evident, not just to his colleagues but to the entire country, is not immediately obvious. On Monday I suggested Grayling must have some high-level kompromat on her, but it’s also possible May is just a sadist who takes pleasure in seeing Grayling turn everything he touches to dust. Having someone like the transport secretary on your team deflects unwanted attention from everyone else’s shortcomings.Seaborne Freight is, of course, the apotheosis of Failing Grayling’s career. All his previous mishaps, such as privatising the probation service, banning books for prisoners, awarding a £1.4bn contract to Carillion after it had issued a profits warning, screwing up the introduction of the new railway timetables, bailing out the East Coast mainline and closing down Gatwick over Christmas, were just warm-up acts for the clusterfuck of all clusterfucks.For May, Failing Grayling’s decision to award a £13.8m ferry contract to a company with no ferries, no cash and no ports was an act of genius. A Triumph of the Won’t. Time and again she rushed to his defence. It was absolutely right that the government should back high-risk businesses that nobody else would go near. The Tories were nothing if not the party of going out of business. What better way to prepare for no deal than having a whole load of businesses with no services primed not to deliver?The prime minister was heard in near silence. Not even the hardcore Brexiters have dreamed up a defence for the Seaborne Stupidity, and most MPs merely looked embarrassed as May sounded increasingly detached from reality. She even started talking of Brexit as “this Brexit matter”. As if it was some minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth-running government“The Labour leader prefers ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest,” May concluded. The perfect description of herself, and definitive proof she had failed the Turing test. An observation only possible from a machine completely lacking in self-awareness.There was no way back from this, and the rest of the session passed by on life support. Enlivened only by the Conservative Giles Watling saying he was sick to death of the French and Germans taking bites out of his cats and dogs, and it was high time Britain passed its own laws preventing people from eating their pets. Truly, Grayling has an heir apparent.Not that there aren’t others fighting for that accolade as the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, was keen to prove when he answered an urgent question on why only six of the 40 trade deals that he had insisted would be rolled over and ready to go by 30 March had been agreed. People should stop being so negative, he said, and start cheering the new deal with the Faroe Islands, which was almost as good as the one we already had. Though he couldn’t for the life of him work out why it was that so many countries were trying to screw us for worse trade deals now we were leaving the EU.It was a day for the Commons to celebrate the government of all the talentless. A pointless search for even vaguely intelligent life. Samuel Beckett would have approved. Grayling and Fox were what he had in mind. Fail. Fail again. Fail better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616b9eefc6be412b80fe8a7c795597874a0c6ecf/0_250_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31c20c5d915601ed611427ce868731e1","title":"kicking up dust little sign of progress in uk eu talks","story":"Donald Tusk says EU27 are waiting for ‘realistic’ proposals from the UK to break the deadlockThe British government is “pretending to negotiate” with the European Union and has not presented any new proposals to break the Brexit deadlock, according to EU officials.Theresa May’s de-facto deputy, David Lidington, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, met senior EU officials and MEPs in Brussels and Strasbourg this week, but the talks yielded no obvious results.The British side thinks a crucial process has begun and hopes progress will have been made by 27 February when MPs are expected to have another crunch Brexit vote.However, on Wednesday night European council president Donald Tusk said the EU27 was still waiting for proposals. “No news is not always good news,” he tweeted, after meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. “EU27 still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break Brexit impasse,” Tusk said.Barnier, has said current talks with the UK do not even qualify as negotiations. In a call on Tuesday morning with Guy Verhofstadt, chief Brexit representative for the European parliament, Barnier said there were “no negotiations” with the British.“These are courtesy calls at best and we have nothing new to say,” Barnier was reported to have said, by a source familiar with the conversation.Verhofstadt had asked the EU negotiator for an update, following Barnier’s meeting with Barclay over dinner at the British ambassador’s residence in Brussels, where they dined on North Sea sole, roast duck and British cheese, washed down with sancerre and saint-émilion wines.“They are pretending to negotiate while they still don’t know what they want and how they want it,” the source said, who described this week’s meetings as “kicking up dust” and a series of “photo opportunities and pictures”. “We are willing to negotiate, but there is nothing on the table from the British side.”Verhofstadt asked Lidington four times what the British proposal was and “four times didn’t get an answer”, according to the EU official, who described the encounter as “very surreal”.Questions over what Lidington really meant were magnified by Wednesday morning, as officials digested media reports of a late-night bar-room conversation where Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins appeared to suggest a showdown in late March.Another EU source said a separate meeting with the British ministers in Strasbourg revealed “nothing really groundbreaking”.An EU diplomat said May’s strategy was probably to run down the clock “sending her negotiators here and there” to buy time ahead of a European summit on 21-22 March. “They come forward with the same proposals and they get the same answers,” the diplomat said.Numerous EU sources have insisted in public and private that there will be no re-opening of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, stressing that it is up to the British government to work out a plan that commands a stable majority in the House of Commons.The EU is ready to discuss the non-binding political declaration, which sketches out a vision of the UK’s post Brexit ties with the EU. But officials say the UK has not engaged in any talks on re-writing the political declaration.Roberto Gualtieri, a Socialist member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering committee, urged British ministers to look seriously at Jeremy Corbyn’s customs union plan. But they told him it was unlikely to command a majority in the Commons, according to an EU source.Donald Tusk, the European council president, also suggested May should look at the Corbyn plan as a way to break the impasse when the pair met last week, but the prime minister did not respond.The British hope the EU will agree to changes on the contested Irish backstop, which Tory Eurosceptics say they cannot accept in its current form. After his meetings in Strasbourg, Barclay told journalists that Westminster needed to see “legally binding change to the backstop”, saying this was the “the clear message” of the Graham Brady amendment MPs voted for last month.The UK is pursuing three avenues for those changes: a time limit, an exit mechanism and “alternative arrangements” being examined by a Conservative MPs working group.“Time limit, exit clause, magical solutions based on technology, these are all things we have heard before,” a senior EU official said. “We cannot start inventing solutions for the British.”The EU remains reluctant to firm up previous reassurances on the temporary nature of the backstop by putting them into a different legal document. Tory backbenchers have floated the idea of a codicil, a format that has no formal status in EU negotiations.EU sources remain unconvinced such a legalistic move would change minds. “I don’t think she has shown to anyone she could muster a majority,” said one EU diplomat. “There is not much incentive to move.”The senior EU official described the Brexit outlook as “not encouraging”, arguing that the prime minister’s decision to seek changes on the backstop had closed down options for a deal. “Theresa May chose to ally herself with the most radical Brexiteers. She did so to reunify her party and frankly I don’t think any deal is possible on that basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8170da7b7b7248043e71e331fc37f49375c053f5/0_71_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0088d5a119d700a187bc8b597aff1140","title":"labour mp submits plan for referendum on brexit deal","story":"Labour leader struggling to balance conflicting forces in his party over BrexitJeremy Corbyn faces up to 10 resignations from the Labour frontbench if he fails to throw his party’s weight behind a fresh attempt to force Theresa May to submit her Brexit deal to a referendum in a fortnight’s time, frustrated MPs are warning.With tension mounting among anti-Brexit Labour MPs and grassroots members, several junior shadow ministers have told the  they are prepared to resign their posts if Corbyn doesn’t whip his MPs to vote for a pro-referendum amendment at the end of the month.Corbyn has been struggling to balance the conflicting forces in his party over Brexit, as the clock ticks down towards exit day on 29 March..Many party members and MPs would like him to take a lead in seeking to block Brexit before time runs out – but some frontbenchers are equally adamant they could never support a referendum.Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Corbyn, risked stoking the conflict in the party on Wednesday when he argued that stopping Brexit was “not the best option for our nation”.“My view is that, having had a 2016 referendum where the people have voted to come out of the EU, to try and deflect away from that threatens the whole democratic fabric on which we operate,” he told Peston on ITV. “I’m saying that in reality it is not the best option for our nation.”The party’s conference policy, thrashed out in a late-night meeting chaired by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, suggests that if it has failed to secure a general election “Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.And it includes the line: “If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.”Since the prime minister’s deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last month, Labour has continued to engage with the government after Corbyn initially declined a meeting with May.The pair exchanged letters last week setting out their respective Brexit positions, and senior Labour figures met ministers on Tuesday.Starmer and the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, were accompanied by Corbyn’s close advisers Seumas Milne and Andrew Fisher as they met the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer and Jon Trickett had a frank and serious exchange with Stephen Barclay and David Lidington following Jeremy Corbyn’s five-demands letter to Theresa May.“Starmer and Trickett set out Labour’s five demands and pushed the government to change its red lines.” Senior Labour sources said they believed the meeting had gone well, and expect a follow-up session to be held next week. But anti-Brexit MPs believe it is time to shift the policy towards supporting a referendum, as May has rejected Labour’s advances by continuing to rule out a customs union.Some see Starmer as the most likely champion for their cause inside the shadow cabinet. Other key figures, including Trickett and the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, are more sceptical.Attention is focusing on plans made by the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, under which parliament’s endorsement of a deal would be made subject to the public’s approval, echoing the model pursued for the Good Friday agreement.“That’s where the action is,” said one backbencher. There could also be a straightforward “people’s vote” amendment when May brings an amendable vote to MPs on 27 February.Several frontbenchers, including the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, and the shadow business minister, Chi Onwurah, will speak at a Love Socialism, Hate Brexit rally at parliament before the vote on Thursday. The rally is being promoted by the pro-referendum group Another Europe is Possible.Lewis previously quit as shadow defence secretary in order to rebel against the triggering of article 50, but has since returned to the Labour frontbench.He said last week: “I’m on the frontbench because I live in hope that the party will get to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people’s vote.”Even some shadow frontbenchers opposed to a second referendum are coming to the view that the party needs a “cathartic moment” to whip for a new referendum and prove that the plan has no parliamentary majority, with more than 20 Labour MPs likely to oppose. One sceptical shadow minister said the February deadline would be the time for “peak agitation”.Tensions over the party’s Brexit policy have been simmering since Corbyn made his offer of a Brexit compromise in a letter to May last week, prompting former leadership candidate Owen Smith to suggest he could quit the party if Labour eventually backed a Brexit deal.Anger spilled into the open on Wednesday. The MP Neil Coyle claimed the party was losing members and councillors, and could yet lose MPs over its Brexit policy.One Labour MP, Geraint Davies, tabled an amendment attempting to bring forward the crunch point for the Labour leadership by calling for a referendum on May’s deal but it was not directly connected with that of Kyle and Wilson. “It’s very premature,” one MP said.Davies’ amendment, which he submitted on Wednesday, will be attached to a government motion laying out the next stage of Brexit negotiations. MPs are due to vote on the motion on Thursday.Davies said his amendment would help build support for another legally binding amendment on a second referendum at the next opportunity.“There is a hidden majority in the house that want to support this position, but they are all waiting around for some guiding north star for them to follow before they take action, but we are running out of time,” he said. “MPs are in danger of being complicit if they do not take action now.”But Kyle said he was not behind Davies’ amendment and had hoped to wait until there was more momentum behind the move.“The main push for this will be the meaningful vote. Clearly the landscape changes but this vote tomorrow is not binding and this amendment should not be interpreted as the main bid for support,” he said.Corbyn was criticised for failing to take tougher action against MPs who declined to back Yvette Cooper’s amendment aimed at averting a no-deal Brexit but chief whip Nick Brown has made clear to MPs he would deal with all Brexit votes in the round, at the end of the process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545dcd3ba148179e4f7724a7600e55b29bac07f1/0_150_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2b9b4918b5e981647c1b3d83f984767","title":"nasa makes final attempt to communicate with mars rover opportunity","story":"Robot the size of a golf buggy has sent data to Earth for 15 years but fell silent eight months ago and Nasa says mission is completeNasa declared the 15-year mission of the veteran Mars rover Opportunity finally over on Wednesday, crediting the robot as having “transformed our understanding of our planet”.The golf buggy-sized vehicle last made contact with Earth eight months ago, after being caught in a global dust storm.Announcing the mission’s end, Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa, said the rover had “remained silent” after a last-ditch effort to contact Opportunity on Tuesday.Despite the loss, the mood at the press conference at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, was one of celebration on Wednesday.“I’m standing here with a sense of deep appreciation and gratitude to declare the Opportunity mission as complete,” Zurbuchen said.“It transformed our understanding of our planet, everything we do and think about in our planetary neighborhood with Mars and elsewhere relates to the research from that and the engineering breakthroughs that came from that.”Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004 shortly after its twin – a rover called Spirit. Together, the pair were part of Nasa’s Mars Exploration Rover programme. However, the Spirit got stuck in soil in 2009 and was declared defunct in 2011.By contrast, Opportunity has continued to trundle over the surface of Mars and send back data to Earth, acting as a sort of remote geologist.John Callas, Mars Exploration Rover project manager, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that epic journey had been due to a “phenomenal” effort and had “greatly expanded our understanding of the red planet”.Over the 15 years it has spent on Mars, Opportunity has clocked up more than 45km (28 miles) – despite being designed to travel only 1,006 metres and last 90 Martian days.“We had expected that dust falling out of the air would accumulate on the solar rays and eventually choke off power,” Callas said.“What we didn’t expect was that wind would come along periodically and blow the dust off the arrays.“It allowed us to survive not just the first winter, but all the winters we experienced on Mars.”Opportunity was finally done in by a “historic” dust storm, said Abigail Fraeman, MER deputy project scientist. Fraeman said the storm had turned the sky so dark that Opportunity “couldn’t see the sun and the solar panels couldn’t recharge the battery”.During its mission, the rover found tiny iron-rich spheres nicknamed “blueberries” at the crater that suggested a wet past, while its analyses of clay minerals near the Endeavour crater confirmed parts of Mars were once covered in neutral water, and could have been a habitable environment. It also came across the first meteorite ever to be discovered on another planet. In addition, the rover has sent back stunning images, including capturing a Martian “dust devil” twisting across the planet’s surface and panoramic shots that provided breathtaking views of Martian craters.Another aspect of Opportunity’s legacy is the number of people who were inspired to pursue careers in science through following the rover’s trek, Fraeman said.“There really are hundreds if not thousands of students who, just like me, witnessed these rovers and followed along their mission, from the images released to the public over the last 15 years and then because of that went on to pursue careers in science.”“It has been a fantastically successful mission which has completely outlived its shelf life,” said Professor Andrew Coates, a planetary scientist at University College London’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory.“One of those core things about Opportunity was it landed in this crater which was in sight of sedimentary types of rocks and that was the first time that sort of thing had been seen on Mars,” said Coates. “People compared it at the time to an interplanetary hole in one.”Professor John Bridges from the University of Leicester, who is part of the team working on Nasa’s continuing Curiosity rover project and the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, said Opportunity had a fantastic roll call of achievements. He added that with its twin the rover had been key in changing the idea of Mars from being a lump of basalt in space to having a very different geological history, showing the importance of lakes and other features.Coates, who is also lead scientist for the panoramic camera instrument on the ExoMars rover – recently named Rosalind Franklin – which is set to be launched in 2020, said the discoveries of Opportunity, and later the Curiosity rover, have been important for the development of new missions.“The next step now of course is to drill and look for signs of life, and that is exactly what we are doing with the ExoMars rover, drilling up to 2 metres underneath the surface,” he said.The final attempt at communication with Opportunity on Tuesday night was, it seems, an emotional affair. Dr Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist who worked on the mission, tweeted: “There were tears. There were hugs. There were memories and laughs shared.”Mike Seibert, who was also part of the team, paid tribute to the rover nicknamed “Oppy”, saying “Goodbye old friend” and noting that the rover was the longest lasting surface mission yet.Coates said Opportunity’s demise was bittersweet. “It is a matter of both celebration for what it was able to achieve and in the broad context of Mars exploration, but also tinged with sadness, losing an old friend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d197d27e73decfae9a3feef95d8beac1add116/1468_537_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcd71a6fff38cb240a5eed128eb57e7d","title":"living in poverty workers at business department go on strike","story":"Outsourced cleaners, catering staff and security guards say they cannot live on their payCatering staff earning as little as £7.83 an hour danced and sang outside their work at the business department as they staged a 26-hour strike in protest at what they described as poverty pay.Many of the outsourced catering team at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) earn no more than the minimum wage, well below the £10.55 that the Living Wage Foundation calculates is necessary for an adequate life in the capital.They were joined by cleaners, porters, receptionists and security guards at the department who are fighting for enough money to survive without hardship.Ana Joaquim, from Wood Green, who is originally from Portugal, earns £8.50 an hour as a barista at BEIS, which outsources its catering to a company called Aramark.“We are living in poverty in this company,” she said. “They pay the minimal national wage we are not entitled to 28 days’ holiday.”Her colleague Novlette Hurd, from Wandsworth, who is originally from Jamaica, earns even less – £8.19 per hour – despite 21 years’ service at the department. “We can’t live because, for starters, I’ve got dependent children and it’s just not going anywhere,” Hurd said. “I’ve been meaning to shop for my son since Christmas and I have to save for months just to take him shopping.“The £8.19 I’m getting, I’m only getting it because before they asked me to supervise, so there’s 50p extra – it was £7.79. Like, you think, why do I bother to work? It just makes you desperate some days. You just get up and you think: does it make sense to go to work?”The strike, which began on Wednesday and continues until Thursday at 7pm, comes after joint strike action on 22 January, when support staff in the United Voices of the World union at the Ministry of Justice joined the BEIS workers for a one-day strike and demonstration in Westminster.The business secretary, Greg Clark, who is responsible for workers’ rights nationally, has been leading talks with trade unions and Labour MPs to try to win support for the government’s Brexit deal.However, the public-sector union PCS, which represents the support staff, said his department has repeatedly refused to negotiate with them on an increase in pay to the London living wage and a return to the terms and conditions support staff enjoyed before they were outsourced.Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of PCS, said: “Our members are determined to do whatever it takes industrially, to get decent pay and conditions at work. The private contractors Aramark and Engie should be ashamed of themselves for not paying staff the London living wage.“BEIS who awarded the contracts to these companies also share the responsibility for resolving this dispute. Ministers need to step in and ensure that outsourced workers are paid the same as other BEIS colleagues and ultimately bring the jobs back in-house.”A BEIS spokesperson said: “All our staff are valued members of the BEIS team and all deserve a fair and competitive wage, whether directly employed or working for our contractors.“Following a review of contractor pay, the department has agreed with its contractors that they will align the pay of their cleaning, catering, mailroom and security staff with pay rates for workers in comparable roles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3740a4fd55dd11921bdcc0d6c3a75cd1e57b1fa/123_134_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d7e2ef4cb8552d50a4ef973b8500ef8","title":"caster semenya iaaf report","story":"The IAAF has emphatically rejected a report that it wants the women’s Olympic 800m champion, Caster Semenya, to be classified as a biological male when her landmark case is heard next week.Athletics’ governing body told the  it was not classifying any athletes with differences in sexual development (DSDs) as male, “accepted their legal sex without question” and would allow all of them to continue to compete in the female category. However, it wants the court of arbitration for sport to rule that DSD athletes such as Semenya, who was reportedly born with testes, must have their testosterone reduced to female levels before they compete internationally in order to ensure fairness with other women.Explaining its position, the IAAF said: “If a DSD athlete has testes and male levels of testosterone, they get the same increases in bone and muscle size and strength and increases in haemoglobin that a male gets when they go through puberty, which is what gives men such a performance advantage over women.“Therefore, to preserve fair competition in the female category, it is necessary to require DSD athletes to reduce their testosterone down to female levels before they compete at international level.”The IAAF’s lawyer, Jonathan Taylor, told the  that the initial story was a mischaracterisation of the IAAF’s case, which will be heard at Cas next week.“The IAAF has not said that DSD athletes should be classified as male,” he said. “That is what Caster Semenya’s lawyers say our case is, because they think that will help them before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but that is not our case.”Semenya has been unbeatable over the distance ever since Cas decided to change the rules in 2015 to allow inter-sex athletes to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication.However, last year the IAAF produced scientific evidence that suggested testosterone makes a big difference in events ranging from 400m to a mile.As a result it said it would change its rules to create “a level playing field to ensure all female athletes have an equal chance to excel”.That scientific evidence has since been called into question, while Semenya’s supporters also believe that asking her to take such medication infringes on her rights. Last year the United Nations’ human rights special procedures body urged the IAAF to drop the regulations, claiming they “contravene international human rights”. Some women athletes also feel they are at a massive disadvantage racing against DSDs. The 2016 Olympic 800m final was won by Semenya while the silver and bronze medallists, Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi and Margaret Wambui of Kenya, have also faced questions about their testosterone levels.Earlier that year Britain’s Lynsey Sharp, who finished sixth in the final said: “Everyone can see that it’s two separate races so there is nothing I can do.”If Cas rules in favour of the IAAF, Semenya and other DSD athletes will have to reduce and then maintain their testosterone levels to no greater than 5nmolL for six months prior to competing internationally in events ranging from 400 metres to a mile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224396b9f2f874cc2b961e7956090122972082cc/0_12_4397_2638/master/4397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26c45de455d300bf5001f7b8f9d403c8","title":"horse racing flu suspension returns wages","story":"For six days racing has been suspended at British racecourses and jockeys, bookies and punters were all relieved to returnFor the first time in a week there was the sound of hooves thudding against turf on a British racecourse on Wednesday. There were not as many hooves as normal, perhaps, since an unknown number of jumping horses have not had a booster jab against equine flu in the last six months, a strict requirement for every runner as the sport emerges from self-imposed quarantine after flu outbreaks in Newmarket and Cheshire. But it was still competition and a much-needed chance to earn a wage after a six-day suspension.Many of racing’s employees are earning only when the action starts.

There would have been mortgage-payment worries if it had gone on much longer.”At Musselburgh on Tuesday evening Andrew Hughes was forced to turn his horsebox round and set off on the long journey back to his base in County Kilkenny after his six-year-old The Tartan Spartan failed to meet the British Horseracing Authority’s new biosecurity requirements.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsNo horses were turned away from Plumpton on Wednesday but one was ruled out overnight because its last flu booster jab was more than six months ago and, in all, only 46 runners faced the starter on the six-race card.Like many National Hunt trainers Anthony Honeyball had been forced to rummage through the passports of his entire 50-horse string to determine which were still eligible to run, after the BHA announced its new rule on Monday night.“The only thing for me was that at 11 o’clock at night I was qualified for anything I wanted to run in and then, at 11.30, half the horses can’t run. I can’t even offer a better way, though. There’s plenty of clever people looking at it and that’s their job, and my job is train the horses.“We don’t tend to do a mid-winter booster now but we’re probably going to be forced to do it in future, which is a pain in the backside to be honest. We’d like to go September and May, so it’s eight months and four, but you’ve got to be six months now and it’s going to be like that for a good while.”Alan King, whose Good Man Pat was the second winner of the day, has a full yard to run as he routinely gives his string flu boosters in January, although “believe it or not, this is the first year when I nearly didn’t do them, because they were in pretty good form and it can knock them back”.Aidan Coleman, Acey Milan’s rider, was one of a group of around half a dozen leading jump jockeys, also including Sam Twiston-Davies, Kielan Woods and Tom Cannon, who made a swift dash for the ski slopes of Chamonix when the six-day suspension of racing was announced last Thursday.Others, though, were more circumspect as they were forced to take an unexpected break from one of sport’s most injury-prone occupations.“I’ve not been doing a great deal, in fairness,” James Best said after a surprise win on the 22-1 chance Micquus in a handicap chase. “I haven’t skied in my life before. I thought, if I go and try that, I’ll definitely break an ankle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c486d7eaf6cc67dafcfec3ffd04c38ac92df5b22/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2ad0ff2b3cc931f4e58517ed5815e4f","title":"joe root andy murray gareth southgate social tolerance","story":"England captain has done cricket a great service – his reaction to a perceived homophobic remark was cool, calm, collected … and rightCricketers call it sledging, or chirping: the business of trying to undermine your opponent with verbal abuse. It’s a dismal habit that shows us sport at its most small-minded and should have been banned long ago. But this week it has done the world a favour.In the Test in St Lucia, the West Indies bowler Shannon Gabriel was bad-mouthing the England captain, Joe Root. What Gabriel said the stump microphone did not catch but it did bring us Root’s reply: “Don’t use it as an insult. There’s nothing wrong with being gay.”Root was on his way to a much-needed century but his return to form was overshadowed by his remark. “Boy do I applaud Joe Root’s reaction here,” said Nasser Hussain, once England captain himself, now Sky Cricket’s most trenchant voice. “For me his 12 words as a role model will be in the end more important than a Test hundred or possible victory.”St Lucia is one of nine Caribbean nations where homosexuality remains illegal (unlike Gabriel’s homeland, Trinidad and Tobago) but the cultural backdrop makes no difference to Root’s position. He thought he heard something homophobic and dealt with it. He was cool, calm, collected – and right.It should not be a big deal, nearly 20 years into the 21st century, that a leading sportsman calls out homophobia. Women’s sports are way ahead on this front. In 2016, Kate Richardson-Walsh led England’s hockey team to Olympic gold, three years after marrying one of her teammates, Helen. In 2017, cinemas showed a movie, Battle of the Sexes, that was partly about a gay love affair Billie Jean King had in the 1970s when she was the world No 1 in women’s tennis.Forty years on, no professional male footballer in Britain has ever come out during his career. A cricketer has – Steve Davies, the Somerset and former England wicketkeeper. It was brave of him but, with only eight caps, none of them in Tests, he may not be quite well-known enough to have had a wide impact.Root, unmistakably, is well-known enough. And the circumstances help too: he was not giving a press conference, he was not being paid to promote anything, he was just being natural. He is, by all accounts, a decent person and he showed it even in the heat of battle. Afterwards he was statesmanlike, insisting that what was said on the field should stay there. It was a bit late for that but Root was being magnanimous towards Gabriel. He could have been following Michelle Obama’s advice: “When they go low, we go high.”By speaking out, Root joins the select club of men in British sport who have stood up for social tolerance. The unofficial chair is Andy Murray, who identifies as a feminist and proved it in 2014 by employing Amélie Mauresmo as his coach.The club’s vice-chair is the England football manager Gareth Southgate, who recently congratulated Raheem Sterling on his bravery in pointing out how differently he and a young white player had been treated by the tabloids. “Football is a mirror of society,” Southgate argued, in his measured way. “Unfortunately racism exists in society and so there are times when people seem to use the opportunity at a football ground to fuel that. We have to stand strong as a game to make sure that does not happen.”Southgate has also said there were “racial undertones” to the Brexit vote. Well, obviously – but good for him being prepared to say it, and thus dismay people who manage to express racist views while supporting a multiracial team.Root’s remark was not just good for the cause of tolerance. It was good for the game of cricket, which tends to be culturally conservative, verging on reactionary. Anxious that cricket holds little appeal for women and children, the England and Wales Cricket Board is bringing in a new format called The Hundred, played nowhere else in the world. Twelve words from Root may end up doing more for cricket’s image than a £40m tournament.Tim de Lisle is a former editor of Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d91b242773da8bb8b59b6172add16b02a950b71/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39d98650f31bb823423fe3601fccc87","title":"send us a tip on small music venues the world over for the chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it’s a shack, ornate theatre or backstreet club, we want to know about your favourite small music venue – anywhere apart from the UKHearing great live music in an authentic and memorable setting can be a highlight of any trip.Venues including shebeens, clubs, theatres, basements, e bars and even churches can all prove brilliant settings for gigs.We want to hear about great venues anywhere in the world, but not festivals or the UK this time (we covered that in December) – and definitely not arenas or stadium gigs.

Let’s hear it for progress!), the switch to UC leaves them without a payment for the first five weeks. If you are in a position to manage without income for five weeks, lucky you. And if you can’t imagine being in quite the opposite position – if you can’t imagine not even being within hailing distance of that position or knowing a single other person who is – shame on you, and would you like to take up a prominent position of your choosing in the cabinet whenever you fancy? They are looking for just your sort. There is footage, amid the shots of Nathan going hunting with his dog in the fields around Hartlepool to supplement the starvation rations he and his girlfriend are on while they await their money, of Theresa May bruiting across the Commons that the Tory party is the party that understands the working class. Second, there is the sight of a man going hunting for rabbits and squirrels in England in 2019, to supplement his aforementioned starvation rations. I must say, typing it isn’t making me feel any less discombobulated.Then there’s the sight of people trying to log the mandatory 35 hours of job-searching to qualify for their credit, in a place where two hours would be enough for a fingertip – fruitless – search of every nook and cranny of employment possibility. “There used to be the chicken factory,” remembers one middle-aged woman. “There used to be the cake factory.” Not any more.There’s the recommendation by the jobcentre that Nathan become an IT technician. “But I can’t read or write!” he points out, not unreasonably.On and on it goes, the madness. And it is maddening. Tested beyond endurance, the documentary’s subjects frequently scream down the phone at the person delivering the latest twist in the tale of no benefits. Did you, like Terri, miss your phone interview with a job coach because the lines were busy? Sanctioned. Even more delay, even less money. Miss an appointment like Nathan did, because you’re illiterate and none too good at life’s admin? Sanctioned. Need a high-protein (ie expensive) diet that your doctor ordered because it looks as if your cancer is back, like Nathan’s mum Tracey? You’re not eligible for anything. Try the local authority. You have? Oh well.Tracey, incidentally, is also the carer for her husband, who has multiple sclerosis. She will end up, if she has not already, saving the NHS a fortune. She and her daughter Tamsyn are desperate for Tamsyn not to end up on the dole herself and are hoping her talent for drumming will save her. It is the slenderest of threads.It is an unflinching series that has the balls to take as its subjects a group of people far from instantly likeable, which is the tempting and manipulative option always open to a documentary-maker, and record the fallout from the new – baffling, circuitous, intransigent – system and implicitly pose the question: how much of its dysfunctionality derives from incompetence and how much is actually by design? Not that it matters to David, who is told late on Friday, on the payphone outside the food bank he has come to, that he must complete a five-day job search before he is entitled to any money. “I need something to survive on,” he sobs in panicked rage. “My cupboards are empty, I’m 40, I’m partially blind.” He cannot wear the contact lenses that help his remaining sight for long enough to be employed. His doctor has told this to many people. “But he’s been defeated.”Fine and honest programme-making though it is, I’m starting to feel there should be a statutory requirement for a companion piece to every programme like this, where after showing life at the sharp end, those responsible for filing it to a near-lethal point are pursued by the same team demanding answers. Otherwise it starts to feel overwhelmingly like preaching to the choir. Those in charge aren’t going to sit and watch in order to check how their big ideas are working out. We know there is no limit to the evidence they will ignore. The question becomes what else television can do in desperate times to hold those rich in wealth and power but morally bankrupt to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d91b8e58e548001a3044d0b651a9b0eea2ff7fa/0_104_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=315a741db159bce278ea20b01f3d5517","title":"alan partridge bbc brexit steve coogan","story":"Norwich’s finest is back on the BBC. His shambling persona is perfect for our political moment, says Steve CooganLast time Alan Partridge hosted a primetime BBC show, he was sacked live on air for punching his boss in the face with a turkey. Now that the world has “realigned itself along Alan lines”, Norfolk’s most famous radio DJ returns from years in the wilderness with This Time with Alan Partridge.Steve Coogan said it “feels right” for his character to return now, particularly given Brexit: “There might be a missive at the BBC saying that a certain area of the viewing audience had been disenfranchised … Alan potentially represents that. You can imagine them thinking we might as well give this guy another bite of the cherry.”In an act of arch self-satire that rivals its own W1A, the BBC has brought Partridge back to front a live One Show-style magazine programme. Partridge becomes the stand-in presenter after the beloved host falls ill. “He didn’t want to be back at the BBC,” said Coogan, “but when an opportunity presents itself, he had to jump at it.”His creation has morphed over 25 years from “unreconstructed, uber-Conservative little Englander” to a more nuanced figure. “Now he’s a bit more like David Cameron. He’s economically conservative but he understands you’ve got to be socially liberal. He tries to embrace things and tries to be ‘on message’ … but he’s not really.”The humour has moved beyond just mocking people who are intolerant. “It’s funnier to go for people who are attempting to adopt what is known as correct thinking and not quite getting it right.” Today’s woke world is rich pickings for Partridge: “He does try to be in tune with the zeitgeist. You don’t feel like you’re flogging a dead horse because you can adapt him to the times and his attitudes will adapt.”Originally created by Coogan with Armando Iannucci and Patrick Marber for the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour in 1991, Partridge has become one of the most popular comedy characters of all time, with shows including I’m Alan Partridge and Knowing Me, Knowing You. More recently, Coogan has worked with the writers Neil and Rob Gibbons on the film Alpha Papa and spoof memoirs I, Partridge and Nomad, as well as defecting to Sky with shows such as Mid Morning Matters and Scissored Isle.In fact, Partridge is so familiar to fans the production can essentially rest on its laurels. “You can just remove all the comedy and have Alan looking seriously at the camera,” said Neil Gibbons, and be left with nothing more than “the anticipation of what he’s going to do.”The magazine show format lets viewers see Partridge’s rambles during live takes, as well as between-takes shots of his ego being soothed by Lynn, his long-suffering assistant. It also features Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking.There was one distinct problem of putting him in that setup, though, said Gibbons: “In the early days of Alan, there was a tightrope he was walking because there was an expectation of professionalism. If someone fluffed a line or got someone’s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.”He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan. “The producers of Good Morning Britain are not tearing their hair out thinking: ‘I wish he’d stop saying something offensive.’ They’re thinking: ‘That’s why he’s on the show.’ We had to ignore that, because if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there’s nowhere for him to fall.”This Time with Alan Partridge starts on BBC One on 25 February at 9.30pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f42414d09383be679f2eeb6dbecae82acc897af/0_0_3763_2258/master/3763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4742dc42fa51afe26b6426bc781ced","title":"federal judge finds manafort lied to mueller","story":"Former Trump aide breached plea deal by making false statements about dealings with alleged Russian operativePaul Manafort lied about his interactions with an alleged Russian intelligence operative even after agreeing to cooperate with Robert Mueller’s inquiry, a judge ruled on Wednesday.Manafort, Donald Trump’s former presidential campaign chairman, was found to have breached his plea deal by making false statements to the special counsel’s team, the FBI and a grand jury about his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik.The finding means that Mueller’s team is no longer obliged to endorse the lighter punishment that Manafort was promised for his crimes when he agreed to cooperate with investigators and tell them the truth. Manafort denied lying.Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the order on Wednesday evening at the federal court in Washington DC.Jackson said Mueller’s team had established that Manafort lied about three disputed issues – his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he took from a pro-Trump campaign group and another investigation that has not been identified.She said Mueller’s team had failed to establish that Manafort lied on two other subjects – his recent contacts with Trump administration officials, and Kilimnik’s role in a conspiracy to obstruct justice for which they were both indicted.Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at boosting Trump’s bid for the White House, and any coordination between Russian operatives and Trump’s team.Manafort, 69, was accused by Mueller of lying about the fact he had shared polling data on the 2016 election with Kilimnik, a former colleague on election campaigns for pro-Kremlin politicians in eastern Europe.Manafort is also said to have misled investigators about plans that he and Kilimnik were developing for a settlement relating to Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine.Kilimnik, 48, trained at a university connected to Russia’s military intelligence agency, formerly known as the GRU, which allegedly spearheaded the Kremlin’s effort to disrupt the US election in 2016.Mueller has also previously said that Rick Gates, Manafort’s deputy on the Trump campaign, described Kilimnik as “a former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU”. Kilimnik denies that characterization.The special counsel moved to tear up Manafort’s plea deal in November, alleging that the former campaign chairman had breached the agreement by continuing to lie. Mueller said the lies amounted to new crimes.Manafort was known to have met Kilimnik twice during 2016. He passed the polling data to Kilimnik during an August meeting in New York, according to investigators. Mueller’s team also found Manafort met Kilimnik in Spain during 2017.Manafort’s attorneys strenuously denied that he had intentionally misled the investigators. They said he could not remember some details and worked to promptly clarify any misstatements.His attorneys did not deny that Manafort gave Kilimnik the polling data, instead stating that he had not lied about it but was merely “unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed”.As part of the plea deal struck last September, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians. Other charges against him were dropped.By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f6d5303d9058dc453061732baa33c955b19d41/2053_308_2984_1790/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a429ef8688913d56ead8f9005e3861d2","title":"african wwii veterans deserve compensation say shadow ministers","story":"Government urged to make amends to ex-soldiers, who were underpaid and beatenPressure is mounting on the government to compensate and apologise to Britain’s last surviving African veterans of the second world war after three shadow secretaries of state called on their Conservative counterparts to acknowledge the systematic discrimination of colonial-era troops.Labour’s Emily Thornberry, Nia Griffith and Dan Carden – the shadow foreign, defence and international development secretaries – demanded in a letter that Theresa May’s administration acknowledge the unfair treatment, launch an investigation into the matter, issue a formal apology and pay veterans compensation.Their intervention came after the  published a document that revealed how Britain paid white soldiers – even those serving in British colonial units and living in African colonies – up to three times more than their black counterparts. The policy meant that a soldier’s skin colour and colonial origins determined pay much as his rank and length of service.“There will therefore be righteous anger and concern amongst the British public at these latest revelations, and also a sense of urgency – given the age and relatively small number of surviving veterans affected – that they should receive at least a thorough investigation and acknowledgement into their unfair treatment, a formal apology, and if feasible, financial compensation, before it is too late,” the senior opposition politicians wrote on Wednesday.“I am sure you all agree that these revelations are utterly reprehensible,” added the shadow secretaries of states in the joint letter, addressed to their counterparts Jeremy Hunt, Gavin Williamson and Penny Mordaunt. “When we look back at posters celebrating the joint service of men from the Empire and Commonwealth during the second world war, each of them willing to fight and die to save civilisation from fascism, we see black, white and Asian marching in step under the banner ‘Together’.“All these years later, it is an unutterable disgrace to discover that the reward for that brave service was so callously calibrated according to the colour of those soldiers’ skin, and I am sure you will agree we must now work together on a cross-party basis, and do everything we can as a country to repair this shameful episode.”Thornberry told the : “These servicemen and their families are owed an acknowledgement and apology for the way they were treated, but those few veterans who are still alive today are also owed a financial debt which must now be paid. Sadly, that compensation will come too late for tens of thousands of their contemporaries, but at least in death, they too will finally have justice.”The details of the discriminatory practices were highlighted in a documentary for al-Jazeera English’s People and Power series to be broadcast on Wednesday night. The documentary also highlights how, although enlistment was supposed to be voluntary as the British government had publicly ruled out conscription, testimony from surviving veterans and their widows undermines this official line.One veteran, 93-year-old Gershon Fundi – whom Britain sent to Ethiopia and Somaliland as a signalman – said: “They were treating us as slaves. We were there not because we wanted to be there. But we were forced to go there. If you run, even if you go home, chiefs would arrest you and then you’re going to be brought back. But how can you complain? To whom are you going to complain?”He added: “We have no voice, we have no voice at all.”Their testimony is supported by the research of leading historians of the era. “Pressure was put on chiefs to provide their quota and they forced men to enlist,” says David Killingray, emeritus professor of modern history at Goldsmiths University, who described the experience of iniduals “caught up by this system” as appalling.Not only were African soldiers in Britain’s forces barred from becoming commissioned officers and from disciplining lower-ranking white soldiers, they were also subjected to corporal punishment, which the British army had officially outlawed for decades.“They beat us,” said Eusebio Mbiuki, a 100-year-old veteran who served in Britain’s Burma campaign against the Japanese. “They beat us a lot. Our bodies became so swollen from the beatings. They would beat us and slap us until you accepted everything you were being told. And you couldn’t answer back. Who would you speak to? They were your commanders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f870c200f79c4df03c3936fe03cfdc7b260d8/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=967b5f32d95395c8a5a47fda427dac89","title":"gospel glamour how nigerias pastors wield political power","story":"With days to go before the presidential election, four-time candidate Chris Okotie insists he is the man for the top jobby  Ruth Maclean and  Eromo Egbejule in LagosDressed in a white outfit delicately striped with gold and carrying a white tambourine, one of the contenders in Nigeria’s presidential election steps out of a white Rolls-Royce and strides up the aisle of the Household of God, flanked by bodyguards.Chris Okotie, a 1980s pop star turned pentecostal pastor and four-time presidential candidate, is leading the service in the church he founded 32 years ago. For close to five hours his glamorous congregation is kept rapt with a medley of his greatest gospel hits, interspersed with prayer, speaking in tongues and a sesquipedalian sermon on the five foolish virgins. Young women in sweeping sparkly dresses sing along adoringly as ageing Nollywood stars boogie at the back.This year, the two presidential frontrunners are both Muslim – the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and the former vice-president Atiku Abubakar.But the “pentecostalisation” of politics, which began 20 years ago, is continuing unabated, experts say, and the democratic process is shaped by powerful pastors, who regularly weigh in on elections. Some pastors even tell their flocks which way to vote. With no pope or archbishops to tell them what to do or say, and therefore no limit to their political activities, pastors have grown in their ambitions.Though the highest Okotie has ever finished is eighth, he still considers himself and his Fresh party to be the solution to Nigeria’s problems. He has offered himself to the two leading candidates as a president everyone can agree on – what he calls a “consensus remedial facilitator” – in an interim government, though the chance they will go for it is slimmer than a communion wafer.Traditionally, the highest office of the vast west African country has alternated between Muslims and Christians. Though northern Muslims have had only a slight advantage, being in office for about 33 of the 58 years since independence, most Nigerians think they have dominated, and Nigeria’s pentecostals are increasingly competing with them for state power.Many Nigerian Christians fear the “Islamisation” of their country, pointing to the rise of Boko Haram in the north-east over the past decade, the spread of Sharia law across many northern states in the early 2000s, and attacks by mostly Muslim herders, who are often unfairly perceived as waging a jihadist campaign against Christian farmers. At least three priests have been killed in as many years in the pastoralist crisis in the Middle Belt, and the perceived nonchalance of the presidency about the issue has turned many Christians against the government.Going into this Saturday’s election, many Christian Nigerians see Atiku, as Abubakar is popularly known, as more liberal than Buhari – and therefore more friendly to them, and more likely to deal with these threats.Buhari, however, has on his side Yemi Osinbajo, the vice-president and a pastor from the Redeemed Christian Church of God, which has over 20,000 branches in 198 countries as well as its millions of Nigerian adherents.In picking Osinbajo, Buhari was continuing to recognise the major political clout of pentecostal Christianity in his country, which is home to some of the world’s biggest megachurches. In 2011 he chose the influential Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly, who gives his sermons titles like The Technology of Wealth Transfer and The Termites of Destiny.Osinbajo and his faithful flock may have been a deciding factor in their 2015 victory, despite the fact that David Oyedepo, the founder of Winners’ Chapel, who preaches a prosperity gospel and has described himself as “dangerously wealthy”, told his congregation to pray for his opponent, the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan, to win.On Sunday 16 February, 84m voters will choose who leads Africa’s largest democracy. Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.Buhari\u0027s 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.Main opposition People\u0027s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\u0026nbsp He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.Atiku\u0027s opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.Nigeria is deeply ided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.It isn\u0027t just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria’s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a Not Too Young to Run campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u0027s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off.Ebenezer Obadare, professor and author of the new book Pentecostal Republic, said that the “old story” of the interaction between religion and democracy had changed with the rise of the pentecostal churches.Pentecostal churches are forcing Muslim leaders to up their game to keep their hold on power, Obadare said. God is invoked on everyone’s side.The pentecostal church has been growing as part of a wave of religious fervour rising in Nigeria since the early 1990s. As the standard of living fell through both military and civilian administrations, citizens clung to their faith for salvation and respite. Pentecostals multiplied in the south, giving purpose and the promise of miracles to their converts.Whoever is in power, working together – what Obadare calls an “inter-religious political bromance” – is crucial. In the 2015 presidential election, Jonathan’s national security adviser spent billions of naira employing marabouts – Muslim holy men – from Saudi Arabia and north Africa to pray for his re-election, according to Nigerian media. Marabouts have enjoyed special access to the presidency since the 1980s.In an interview in his marble antechamber after the service, Okotie delivers his analysis in the same style as his sermons.“The things that ide us are ethnicity and religion, so we must rise above the pastiches of religion, the mosaic of ethnicity and whatever it is that separates us to an altitude where these cleavages diminish into mere superficial lacerations in the terrain of national integration and that’s the message that I’ve been given and that we can translate the paraphernalia of our ersity into the apparatus of national unity because we have an aboriginal connectivity that cannot be vitiated by politics, religion or ethnicity and we need to realise that and if we can embrace this philosophy then there’s hope,” he says, hardly pausing for breath. That was to say, an increasingly ided Nigeria should forget their differences and come together under him.“The Chris Okotie option is the only viable option,” the author of Nigerian classics Show Me Your Backside and Yes I Know He Lives adds, his aides standing reverentially around.Jesus, he says, will be a political leader in his second coming. “What we’re doing now is going to be a microcosm of what is going to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48464a3c9771fe306e5ac4f911d1156c3e1057b9/0_420_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96db386249d7d55411774525f7be3b60","title":"bavaria campaigners abuzz as bees petition forces farming changes","story":"A petition in Bavaria on preserving species ersity, popularly known as the “save the bees” campaign, has garnered sufficient support to enforce significant changes to the state’s farming practices.Environmental groups behind the push to radically change farming methods, including turning more grassland into meadow and ensuring a third of farms are organic over the next decade, are due to meet politicians to discuss the next stage in their drive.As part of the campaign, thousands of people have rallied in the streets dressed in bee costumes, as well as staging a mass buzz-in in an attempt to produce the loudest ever buzz in the world.The carnivalesque mood has helped secure popular support for the serious aims of the campaign to secure a long-term political commitment to safeguard the ersity of flora and fauna and improve the habitats of insects and birds, whose populations have plummeted in recent years.The fact that more than 1 million people had signed the petition by Wednesday evening means politicians will ignore its demands at their peril.The campaign was backed by the Greens, the Bavarian Ecological Democratic Party (ÖDP) and conservation groups.Ludwig Hartmann of the Greens said the more people signed the petition, the clearer the message was to Bavaria’s Christian Social Union government under the leadership of Markus Söder. “It’s time to turn the tide and set a new course for effective nature conservation in Bavaria,” he said.Some farmers have criticised the campaign, however, saying their efforts to embrace environmentally-friendly policies while the financial pressures on them increase have often been ignored. “We are already doing a lot, but often this is dismissed,” said Walter Heidl, the president of the Bavarian Farmers’ Association.News doesn\u0027t always have to be miserable – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe campaign also demands that farmers rescue hedges and trees and preserve habitat on stream and river banks. The state legislature is now obliged by law either to enact the petition or to propose alternative options. Negotiations must begin between its organisers and the CSU next week, and voters will have the final say on their outcome in a referendum later this year.Agnes Becker, the leader of the ÖDP, a very small force which initiated the poll, said that the bee was the symbol but represented a much bigger issue. “It’s not so much about the honey bee as it is about a very long and ever growing list of threatened species of animals and plants,” she told a heated televised debate on the campaign last week. “But the bee is our mascot, our symbol.”She said she and her colleagues would stick to the demands laid out in the petition, which had been compiled after extensive consultation with scientists and lawyers, calling them the minimum required to reverse the damaging effects of intensive farming and global warming.The campaigners said ordinary citizens were also being called on to change their lifestyles, including by not covering garden lawns with wood and concrete.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

More than 7,000 people have been refused so-called “humanitarian protection” since October. There were just 150 approvals in January, down from 2,091 in January 2018, leading to a sharp increase in the number of migrants with no legal status.The data was released by the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a thinktank, based on analysis of figures from the interior ministry. It found a year-on-year rise in rejected asylum applications from 17,500 between October 2017 and January 2018 to close to 25,000 between October 2018 and January 2019.Asylum rejections from June 2018, when the coalition of the Five Star Movement and the League came to power, to September 2018 totalled 19,460, ISPI said.“The decree will keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants in Italy,” Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the ISPI’s migration programme, told the .“According to our estimates, there could be more than 670,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy, partly because the government does not have the capacity to deport them.’’The majority of the people whose asylum requests were denied in recent months arrived in Italy in 2017. It can take an average of 19 months for Italian authorities to respond to an asylum application. The Italian government has promised to repatriate 500,000 people. To date it has repatriated about 500 migrants per month – fewer than the average of the previous government.“We calculated it would take almost a century to repatriate all the migrants denied asylum,” Villa said.Meanwhile, expulsions of migrants denied humanitarian protection have continued from reception centres around Italy. Many of those expelled are likely to become homeless.In January more than 500 people were ousted from a refugee reception centre in Castelnuovo di Porto, a town close to Rome, in the first major eviction since the Salvini decree was brought into law.A further 50 were expelled last week from the Cara di Mineo reception centre in Sicily, one of the largest in Europe.Charities said a Nigerian man who killed himself this month had recently been denied a residence permit. Prince Jerry, 25, a chemistry graduate, was continuing his studies at university having arrived from Libya on a boat two and a half years ago.In mid-January his appeal to stay in the country was rejected and he “fell into a deep depression”, according to sources close to Jerry. He had been staying in Tortona in Piedmont at the time of his death.Father Alex Zanotelli, a member of the Comboni missionaries in Verona, described Jerry’s death as “a state murder, the bitter fruit of the Salvini decree, which besides insecurity produces deaths”.• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

We are not all suited to traditional academic approaches.Apprenticeships, for example, offer excellent “earn and learn” options with on-the-job experience, decent starting salaries and high chance of employment.However, they still suffer – wrongly – from a status problem. Parents – and students – remain obsessed with third level to the detriment of other options."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792897.1550090680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"some third level computing courses have 80 drop out rate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe highest non-completion rates were in courses such as computing (45 per cent), hospitality and services (35 per cent), and engineeringconstruction (33 per cent). Photograph: GettyA majority of students are dropping out of third-level computing and engineering courses with low CAO entry points, official figures show.These high non-completion rates are a source of “huge concern” to education authorities, according to a major new study.The findings are contained in a study by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) which has tracked a cohort of more than 34,000 students who started third-level courses in 200708 over a 10-year period.Overall, the report shows the higher a student’s CAO points, the more likely they are to complete their course.For example, a student with 505-550 points has a 6 per cent chance of dropping out of their course.By contrast, a student with 205-250 points has a 51 per cent chance of not completing their course.Female students are more likely to complete their courses and secure a higher grade in their final degrees.However, male students in low points courses are at the highest risk of not completing their studies.Students on education or teaching courses were least likely to drop out of their courses (9 per cent), followed by those in health and welfare courses such as medicine or nursing (16 per cent).The highest non-completion rates were in courses such as computing (45 per cent), hospitality and services (35 per cent), and engineering construction (33 per cent).Low pointsWhen figures are broken down to low points courses at ordinary degree or higher certificate level, some computing and engineering courses have drop-out rates of more than 70 or 80 per cent.For example, some engineering courses at IT Blanchardstown had drop-out rates of up to 89 per cent, while some computing courses had non-completion rates of 83 per cent.Despite concerns over high drop-out rates in some areas, the study’s authors say Ireland compares well internationally. Overall, more than four out of five students at higher level are completing honour degree courses.This falls to three out of five completing ordinary degree or higher certificate courses.Chief executive of the HEA Paul O’Toole said while findings were mostly positive, further consideration was needed to address some of the challenges identified.“In particular, we need to look at non-completion rates by males in certain areas, and the higher education system is seeking ways to improve the outcomes for those students,” he said.Dr Joseph Ryan of the Technological Universities Association said the capacity of students in maths was a clear factor in high non-completion rates in some computing and engineering courses."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man who was in the house not injured but considerable damage caused to sitting roomInterim committee would focus on whiplash and other soft-tissue injuriesEfforts to counter the threat have fuelled much experimentation and investigationArchitectural historian and astrophysicist pick up top academic accoladesBoard gave contracts to family members in breach of rules, says State watchdogResearch Lives: Dr Anthony Ventresque, Lero, researcher and director of the UCD Complex Software LabDepartment of Education issues warning to secondary teachers\u0026rsquo unionsStudy shows male students with lower Leaving Cert points more likely to drop outHSE took Eamon Murphy to court over confusingly similar \u0026lsquoMy Options\u0026rsquo serviceOmbudsman urges independent review into non-disclosure of \u0026lsquosensitive\u0026rsquo materialExpert says consequences of limit to permits for delivering to Continent would be direIntroduction of HPV test delayed as more than 80,000 women wait for resultsTaoiseach concerned companies had come in with very low tenders to win contracts, and then sought to increase the budgetRebuilding Ireland plan wants to increase the supply of social homes to 10,000 by 2021ESRI finds unmet needs greatest among lower-class families, households in povertyHigh non-completion rates in certain areas of \u0026lsquohuge concern\u0026rsquo to education authoritiesDeirdre Kenneally denies stealing more than \u0026euro11,000 from Co Cork widow"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792877.1550093716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD seize eight cars a day driven by unaccompanied learner drivers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMotorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day. File photograph: Bryan O’Brien Gardaí seized 377 vehicles driven by unaccompanied learner drivers in the first 50 days of new legislation, according to the latest statistics.From December 22nd until February 10th gardaí seized almost eight cars per day on average, from learner drivers who failed to obey the regulation requiring them to be accompanied by a driver who has held a licence for at least two years.While it was already an offence carrying up to four penalty points and a fine of €120 for learners to drive unaccompanied, last December gardaí acquired new powers known as the Clancy Amendment, which allow them to impound the vehicles of learner drivers caught breaking the rule.Motorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day or part day.Where the vehicle’s owner claims the vehicle was taken by the unaccompanied driver without permission, the gardaí may institute an additional prosecution for theft against the learner.The amendment is named after mother and daughter Geraldine and Louise Clancy who were killed on December 22nd, 2015, when an unaccompanied learner driver lost control of her car in Co Cork.The Clancy family campaigned for the amendment and in recent weeks Noel Clancy, father of Louise and husband of Geraldine, has appeared on a new road-safety campaign describing how his wife and daughter were killed and how he misses them.Among the first of the vehicles to be seized under the Clancy amendment was a car which was stopped on the M8 southbound, near Fermoy, by the local roads policing unit, according to the Garda. The driver had been detected speeding, and it was discovered he was an unaccompanied learner driver.The level of vehicle seizures was described as “disappointing” but evidence of the need for the legislation, by a spokesman for the Road safety Authority.‘A disgrace’However Kerry TD Michael Healy Rae described the numbers as “a disgrace”.Mr Healy Rae said young people were being criminalised because of the legislation and were not driving to flout the law, but because they had no other option to get to college or work. He said “politicians inside in the Dáil who voted to ban this told me privately that this is how they learned to drive themselves, it is the ultimate disgrace”.Garda sources said there appeared to be some overlap between offences with those who were not compliant with the Clancy amendment frequently being responsible for further infringements.In one such case, a youth stopped driving in south Dublin had no licence, tax or insurance and told gardaí he had bought the car for €90.One incident found a motorist who was stopped because of a faulty rear light was in fact an unaccompanied learner driver who had taken off the car’s L-plates before driving.In another case, an unaccompanied learner driver failed a roadside breath test and was found to be over the legal alcohol limit.A learner motorist was detected in Co Kildare travelling at 115kmhr in a 50kmhr zone, while driving unaccompanied."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792354.1550063437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bertie ahern asked how ireland feels about re joining the uk","story":"During questions in an Exiting the European Union Committee in London, former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said that Northern  Ireland is not the same as other parts of the UK.

One is that the Republic should just leave the European Union and that would solve all the problems and one which I believe is the subject of a petition to this parliament is that the Republic should re-join the United Kingdom and that would solve all the problems. What’s your impressions of how these various suggestions have been received by the people of Ireland?Mr Ahern responded: “Well I’ll just be kind and say not very well”.“Unfortunately we have an 800-year past of difficulties and that’s just a reality of our history.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe  The leader of Fianna Fáil broke the news to a near-deserted chamber. “I have some, but not for anybody in this House.”At least the heartbroken were allowed the dignity of crying unobserved in their private offices. But as Micheál Martin uttered his cruel words on the eve of Valentine’s Day, the very walls of Leinster House shook with the howls of anguished Fianna Fáil TDs as they hurled gaudy trinkets of platonic affection into the bin.Éamon Ó Cuív, Mark MacSharry, John McGuinness to name but a few.How could Micheál, their great leader – the man they would follow to the end of the Earth if only to make sure he jumped off – be so heartless as to publicly spurn them in the Dáil?For the Fianna Fáil leader was talking about the destination of his Valentine’s cards this year – none of them destined for parliamentary party colleagues.This topical issue was raised by Richard Boyd-Barrett after he had finished pleading with Leo Varadkar to raise the income threshold for people who want to stay on the social housing list.“Lastly, I just want to say, Taoiseach, I have a Valentine card for you. In fact, I have a lot of them,” announced the People Before Profit TD, hastily adding: “They’re not to profess my undying love for you, they are from schoolchildren who were outside the Dáil today.”He had a big sheaf of them, glorious with every shade of crayon and marker and all wishing Leo a happy St Valentine’s Day while also asking him to take emergency action to address the threat of climate change, “something those kids feel you are not doing”. Richard promised he would hand over the cards at the end of the session.Buckets of themLeo remained unmoved, writing his notes, head down. Then again as a young, albeit metabolically challenged, Taoiseach he probably gets buckets of them.The Ceann Comhairle then turned to the Fianna Fáil leader. “Do you have any Valentine cards, Deputy Martin?”Leo laid down his pen briefly and sat back with a smile to hear the answer from his confidence-and-supply partner.Micheál rose slowly, looking a little sheepish. “I have some, eh, but, but . . . not for anybody in this House,” he mumbled, before laughing very loudly to himself.The Taoiseach looked neither surprised nor disappointed as he reapplied himself to his notes.Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty decided to explain why the Fianna Fáil leader is not posting any Valentine felicitations to party colleagues.“They don’t need a card to profess their undying love to each other. That’s already been done on many occasions,” he smirked. (Like at their parliamentary party meeting the previous night, for example, when fond expressions of collegial closeness and compatibility were exchanged between TDs in a warmly poisonous atmosphere of mutual aggravation.)Micheál acknowledged Pearse’s reference to his loved-up Soldiers of Destiny. Smiling through gritted teeth, he gave a little shudder. “Ooh, I tell ya.” he muttered darkly. “Yeah.”Leo wasn’t feeling the love either.“I do hope that Deputy Boyd Barrett told the people who gave him the Valentine’s card the extent to which he objects to a carbon charge, and why it wouldn’t be possible to meet those targets without a carbon charge that drives changes in the behaviour of people and businesses.”That climate change-related reply should go down well with the pupils from the John Scottus national school, who gave the cards they made for the Taoiseach to Boyd-Barrett when he came out to meet them, and the pupils from Educate Together Schools from all over Dublin, who came to the gates of parliament to ask their politicians to take better care of their planet.Head on a plateInside the gates proceedings in the Dáil were exceedingly dull. Perhaps this was because everyone was holding their breath and waiting for Sinn Féin’s latest Notion of No Confidence to play out next week. Except they were not.This time the party is calling for Simon Harris’s head on a plate, although such is the fondness for demanding political scalps they’ve probably run out of plates at this stage.Doherty was in charge of the head-calling on this occasion because Mary Lou McDonald was in England appearing on current affairs TV programmes explaining Sinn Féin’s take on Brexit.She wasn’t the only Irish political figure in the limelight across the water. In the morning former taoiseach Bertie Ahern appeared before a House of Commons committee to give the benefit of his wisdom on the impending breakup between the UK and the EU.He was very well received in the Betty Boothroyd Room in Westminster, and took the opportunity to remind his hosts that in his heyday he addressed a joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament.And a few hours later he was knocking on doors in Phibsborough and Drumcondra doing his usual rounds. But he didn’t tell them that.Meanwhile, back in his old Dáil stomping ground Doherty repeated that it was time for Harris to go and then, with the rest of the Opposition, he got stuck into an early-evening interrogation of Harris which lasted for 80 minutes.This leaves the actual no-confidence debate still to come as something of a non-event for most observers, if not for the Minister for Health, who is looking exhausted and won’t relish another stint having to answer questions about how the cost of the national children’s hospital grew faster than Jack’s beanstalk under the oblivious noses of Government bean-counters.But he got through this latest grilling without much trouble and with a minimum of shouting from the Opposition. Unless damaging information emerges in the interim, Harris, along with Paschal Donohoe, his partner in crime from the Department of Finance, are through the gap and out of trouble.Doherty’s causeEarlier in the day, relying upon recent remarks by the former director of the HSE to bolster his case for the defenestration of Harris didn’t help Doherty’s cause. The Taoiseach was quick to point this out.It was “curious” to hear Sinn Féin quoting Tony O’Brien as part of its attack on the Minister for Health when the party’s last motion of no confidence, if he remembered correctly, was against the same Mr O’Brien.Doherty corrected the Taoiseach. The last person Sinn Féin declared unfit to hold office was Eoghan Murphy, the Minister for Housing, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3789531.1549884117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the galway professor behind our understanding of neanderthals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA reconstruction of a Neanderthal man at a museum in Halle, Germany. We now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. File photograph: Sebastian WillnowAFPGetty ImagesWhen you imagine a Neanderthal you probably think of the classic image of the “cave man”: heavy brow, monkey-like face, stooping posture, shaggy hair, holding a big club. Although this is not how most scientists imagine Neanderthals today (have a look at http:www.nhm.ac.ukdiscoverwho-were-the-neanderthals.html), the early images were based on observed characteristics of Neanderthal skeletal remains. An Irish-based scientist, the geologist William King, had an important role in interpreting these remains and even provided the name Homo neanderthalensis to express his belief that they were the remains of a new species of hominid similar to, but distinct from, modern humans.The position of Neanderthals in the ancestral tree of Homo sapiens has been a subject of debate since the first skull was discovered in Germany in 1856. Since then, fragments of more than 500 iniduals have been discovered. Scientists have asked questions about Neanderthal language and cognition, about Neanderthal tools, about Neanderthal burial practices and beliefs. Perhaps the most furious debate has concerned their relationship to fully modern humans. After the Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010, the debate has focused on how much interbreeding occurred between communities of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens in Europe. In short, what percentage of our DNA did we get from Neanderthals? Before genome sequencing, scientists could only use their knowledge of comparative anatomy to determine the relationship between fossilised remains and living organisms. Using a cast of a skull cap and the descriptions of other Neanderthal skeletal remains written by other scientists, King asserted that the remains found in the Neander valley were different enough from modern humans to form a new species.King, originally from Sunderland, had been appointed a professor of geology at one of the newly opened Queen’s Colleges in 1849. The controversial “non-denominational” colleges were the precursors of NUI Galway, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast and aimed to increase the opportunities for Ireland’s middle classes to access higher education. The colleges were particularly forward thinking in their focus on scientific instruction. Isolated in Galway with few students but with a good laboratory and access to the ever-increasing scientific periodical press, King ranged widely across many sciences we might now consider separate. Most geologists today would think twice about debating the comparative anatomy of modern humans, chimpanzees and ancient remains. Yet when King obtained a cast of the unusual German skull cap, he compared it with a variety of other skulls (using both a collection of objects and descriptions in scientific papers) and concluded that the skull was so different from modern humans as to constitute a new species. Before King’s contribution, the predominant view was that the Neanderthal might be a deformed or diseased human. King dismissed this idea with the suggestion that even the most degraded and “inferior” human races (as King believed races other than Europeans to be) showed a more spherical skull and a higher forehead than the Neanderthal skull cap suggested. During the 19th century, a high forehead was believed to indicate superior intelligence. Australian Aborigines were most Europeans’ favourite example of a supposedly “degraded” and “savage” race and King believed that even their skulls showed more similarity to modern humans than the Neanderthal skull. In short, the Neanderthal skull’s “strong simial tendencies” led King to believe that it was simply too different from humans to be of the same species. In his 1864 paper for the Quarterly Journal of Science he even proposed in a foonote that “I now feel strongly inclined to believe that it is not only specifically but generically distinct from Man”. That is, not a member of the genus Homo. It is hard for us to recapture the shock value of King’s ideas in asserting the existence of another species of human-like creatures at a time when the Biblical version of creation was widely considered an accurate description of the Earth’s history.Things have come almost full circle from King’s time: we now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. Yet what has remained curiously consistent is our belief that Neanderthals were inferior to modern humans, although the explanations have changed. Rather than the absence of a high forehead, scientists now refer to the absence of some kind of genetic adaptation that enabled Homo sapiens to create more advanced societies and out-compete their shorter, stockier neighbours.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793606.1550126867!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"manafort lied to investigators on russia judge rules","story":"Paul Manafort intentionally lied to investigators and a federal grand jury in the Russia investigation, a judge has ruled.The ruling by US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson was another loss for the former Trump campaign chairman, who faces years in prison in two separate criminal cases stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.It hurts Manafort’s chance of receiving a reduced sentence, though the judge said she would decide the exact impact during his sentencing next month.The four-page order resolves a dispute that had provided new insight into how Mr Mueller views Manafort’s actions as part of his broader probe of Russian election interference and any possible coordination with associates of US president Donald Trump. The judge found there was sufficient evidence to say Manafort broke his plea agreement by lying about three of five matters that prosecutors had singled out.That included his misleading the FBI, prosecutors and a federal grand jury about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, his co-defendant who the FBI says has ties to Russian intelligence.DiscussionsProsecutors had accused Manafort of lying about his discussions with Kilimnik about a possible Ukrainian peace plan.During a sealed hearing, Mueller prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said one of the discussions — a meeting on August 2nd, 2016 at the Grand Havana Club cigar bar in New York — went to the “larger view of what we think is going on” and what “we think the motive here is”.“This goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the Special Counsel’s Office is investigating,” Mr Weissmann said, adding: “That meeting and what happened at that meeting is of significance to the special counsel.”The meeting occurred while Manafort was still in a high-ranking role in the Trump campaign. Rick Gates, Manafort’s longtime deputy and also a Trump campaign aide, also attended.Prosecutors also accused Manafort of lying about sharing polling data with Kilimnik during the 2016 presidential campaign.Manafort’s lawyers had argued that he did not intentionally mislead investigators but rather forgot some details until his memory was refreshed.They also said the special counsel had not shown that the topic at issue was material to the investigation.In her ruling, the judge said prosecutors did not sufficiently back up two allegations against Manafort, saying she could not find that he intentionally lied about Kilimnik’s role in witness tampering or what Manafort told investigators about his contacts with the Trump administration.– AP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793599.1550126708!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryan adams accused of manipulative behaviour by seven women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeveral women say Adams offered to jumpstart their music careers, then pursued them sexually and in some cases retaliated when they spurned him. He denies the claims. Photograph: Elizabeth WeinbergThe New York Times.Rock singer Ryan Adams on Wednesday called a New York Times article about him “upsettingly inaccurate” but said he was “not a perfect man” and apologised to anyone he had hurt. Adams (44) was responding on Twitter to a New York Times story in which seven women, including his ex-wife actress Mandy Moore, accused him of manipulative behaviour and of pursuing female artists for sex. One of the women said he had exchanged sexually explicit messages online with her when she was aged 15 and 16. “I am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologise deeply and unreservedly,” Adams tweeted. “But the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented some are exaggerated some are outright false. I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage. Period.,” he added. Andrew Brettler, an attorney for Adams, told the newspaper that the singer “unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.” Asked for further comment, Brettler referred Reuters to Adams’ statement on Twitter. Adams launched his music career with the band Whiskeytown and made his solo debut in 2000 with the album “Heartbreaker.” Also a songwriter and record producer, he has worked with some of the industry’s big names, including John Mayer, Willie Nelson and Norah Jones. Adams is the latest of dozens of men to be accused of inappropriate behaviour in the past 18 months as the #MeToo movement has spread beyond Hollywood and into the music industry, politics and corporate boardrooms. Actress and singer Moore, who married Adams in 2009, told the New York Times that “music was a point of control for him.” Moore said that during their marriage Adams diminished her talents as a singer and she accused him of controlling behaviour. Their orce was finalised in 2016.

Photograph: Win McNameeGetty At some point, any able-bodied Democrat who does not run for US president will have searching questions to answer about their self-esteem.Declared and probable candidates for 2020 are well into the double figures. Senator Kamala Harris has even reached the excruciatingly titled memoir-manifesto stage, with The Truths We Hold and, for lucky children, Superheroes are Everywhere.Surveying this erse, jostling field, many commentators say the party’s future is left wing. Radicalised in opposition to president Donald Trump, activists are demanding universal healthcare\u0026nbspthe abolition of current immigration enforcement and\u0026nbspthrough a Green New Deal, the rapid decarbonisation of the US economy.The centre is clean out of morale and, after Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016,\u0026nbspelectoral credibility, too. When Trump decried “socialism” in his State of the Union address, he was inadvertently flattering the left’s current momentum.Trump has made some Democrats ravenous for an equal and opposite reaction to him. But he has made many more just itch to defeat him, whatever the means. A Monmouth University survey has found that 56 per cent of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favour an electable candidate over an ideologically sympathetic one. Just 33 per cent prefer the inverse. The gap is even larger among women. Polling director Patrick Murray says this preference is untypical in primary races within either party.If this win-at-all-costs discipline seems easy to promise\u0026nbspand harder to practise, remember that it has already been tested. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats could have promised Trump’s impeachment or a battery of green taxes or kinder treatment of immigrants. Instead, they hardly strayed from a narrow, exhaustively poll-tested message about healthcare. The result was a handsome victory.What if the party really were as radical as the hype around a few of its congressional newcomers suggests? A moderate would still have grounds for hope.A candidate who runs as a progressive faces a gauntlet of purity tests. It is the nature of purity that no actual human possesses it. Candidates end up debasing themselves in a futile quest to establish their political pristineness. Harris is already living down her past as a prosecuting attorney, which some liberals cite as proof of latent authoritarianism. Another senator, Elizabeth Warren, has apologised for once registering as “American Indian”, lest anyone think a white-looking woman was claiming victimhood. A third, Kirsten Gillibrand, is accused of coming to the left conveniently late.Even to recite these stories is to feel sorry for the candidates. But it was their choice to pitch to the left, whose tendency to eat its own has never been a tightly guarded secret.A moderate can hope to evade these tests altogether. By never claiming to be all that radical in the first place, any pragmatic compromises on their record are unworthy of censure, or even comment. Klobuchar is some way to the left of a 1990s New Democrat. But it is well known that she gets on with Republicans and only goes so far on universal healthcare.Such accommodations with reality are the point of her candidacy, not a stain to be explained away. Activists may still balk, but they cannot put her through the kind of ideological invigilation that leaves the subject looking shifty, hypocritical and pandering. Dissenting from the base confers a perverse kind of staying power.The Democrats’ leftward turn is a story that has outstripped the available evidence. Some of it is wishful Republican thinking. Some of it is the media’s enchantment with novelty. But just three months ago, the Democrats won suburban votes by the bushel with a risk-averse, even drab campaign. The lesson is not entirely lost on the party. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"What is Article 50?

The Dutch study is awaiting funding.The researchers modified the avian virus so that it could spread between ferrets in a bid to understand what mutations were required for it to become transmissible between humans. Ferrets are often used as a surrogate for humans in the study of airborne diseases because their respiratory tracts are remarkably similar and they contract the same viruses.One of the researchers, Ron Fouchier, from Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, told the journal Science at the time his research was published that the modified strain was “probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make”.  The threat of a “weaponised” pathogen spreading around the world has long been the stuff of nightmares. In 2017, Microsoft founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates warned that “a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year”.A century of deadly outbreaksH5N1  has a high death toll but there is as yet no evidence of sustained transmission between humans. As of the end of January this year there had been 860 cases of the disease among humans since 2003, including 450 deaths. The last reported cases in humans were in 2017.The vast majority of human cases have involved close contact with infected or sick birds or their faecal products in markets in Asia or in backyard smallholdings.In 2014 the US government ordered a pause on funding such studies - known as “gain-of-function” research - into flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, over fears about the potential for the spread of a virus of “enhanced pathogenicity”.At the time there were also high-profile breaches of safety in laboratories handling anthrax and smallpox viruses, adding to the fear over the potential for an accident involving a dangerous pathogen.But now, the United States Department for Health and Human Services said the studies can resume as long as certain conditions on safety measures and communication plans are met although a spokeswoman could not give more details.Virus hunters | Meet the scientists searching for Disease XIn a review of research on pathogens with pandemic potential published last year the department said that the research was “essential to protecting global health and security. However, there were important biosafety and biosecurity measures to take into account. The review said that any research should be evaluated by an independent expert panel, that the pathogen had to be a “credible source” for a potential human pandemic and that containment measures were strong.  Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said gain-of-function studies were interesting although of limited use.These studies don\u0027t tell us how the virus will behave in nature and even in humans. You cannot predict how a virus is going to mutate. I don\u0027t think the benefits outweigh the risks of generating a virus that can spread between humans and could potentially be lethal, he said.You can never guarantee that a virus will not escape. The containment facilities will mean that it would be incredibly difficult but accidents can happen and people can mislabel bottles. And if you put information in the public domain rogue actors or states could copy it - it\u0027s not rocket science, he said. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsWhat is Article 50?

From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad. This should be their covenant with their customers.Duty of Care CampaignWhat is Article 50?

And I don’t regret coming here.She added: I am scared this baby is going to get sick in this camp, that\u0027s why I want to get back to Britain, because I know my baby will be looked after.The three girls had joined another London teenager, Sharmeena Begum, in Syria. All were married off to jihadists. Shamima Begum said at least one of her friends, Kadiza Sultana, had been killed when a bomb hit a house in Raqqa.Renu, eldest sister of Shamima Begum, 15, holds her sister\u0026#39s photo while being interviewed by the media at New Scotland Yard, central LondonThe other two girls reportedly stayed on to fight in Baghuz in eastern Syria, along with a few hundred Isil fighters, as the caliphate came to an end.Shamima Begum and her husband fled instead, and the husband surrendered to Kurdish forces.The girl told the Times she had spoken to her mother in the UK and asked for her support when she goes home.She had also read what had been written about her online by people back in the UK.The caliphate is over, she told the Times. There was so much oppression and corruption that I don’t think they deserved victory. I know what everyone at home thinks of me. But I just want to come home to have my child. All I want to do is come home to Britain.The Home Office said it does not comment on inidual cases, although anyone who returns to the UK after travelling to IS territory faces criminal investigation and stricter laws are now in place.Security Minister Ben Wallace said: The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.Everyone who returns from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by the police to determine if they have committed criminal offences, and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.There are a range of terrorism offences where iniduals can be convicted for crimes committed overseas and we can also use Temporary Exclusion Orders to control an iniduals\u0027 return to the UK.A displaced Syrian woman and a child walk toward tents at the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp of al-Hol in al-Hasakeh governorate in northeastern SyriaTasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who was instructed by the Bethnal Green girls\u0027 families after they ran away, said he was glad (Ms Begum) is alive and safe.He told the Press Association the authorities should be reminded of former politan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe\u0027s position at the time of their disappearance.The position of the politan Police was that they should be treated as victims, so long as they hadn\u0027t committed any further offences while they are out there, he said.Mr Akunjee said he had spoken to the girls\u0027 families, who had expressed the position that they want time and space to process what\u0027s happened.The Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are expected to announce the territorial defeat of Isil in the coming days.Around 2,000 US special forces are expected to be brought home by April.Giving evidence to MPs in the wake of the British schoolgirls\u0027s disappearance, in 2015, senior police officers said they would not be treated as criminals if they returned home.They said there was a difference between the person running around with a Kalishnikov and three schoolgirls who had been duped into travelling to Syria.The girls funded their travel to Syria by stealing jewellery from relatives, paying more than £1,000 in cash to a local travel agent for their flights to Turkey.Donald Trump has said Isil is defeatedand that an announcement is imminent on 100 percent of the caliphate having been retaken.The war to push Isil out of its so-called caliphate had lasted more than four-and-a-half years.The area once covered part of Syria and Iraq that was around the size of Britain.Pentagon officials have warned that Isil remains an active insurgent group in both Iraq and Syria.What is Article 50?

That would mean the new case would ship with older AirPods inside for the first few months, the report claims.When the AirPods 2 do arrive, they are widely rumoured to bring always-on Hey Siri so that people can instantly speak to the voice assistant, health tracking capabilities, and other upgraded features. They might also bring a new colour option, potentially allowing people to buy black as well as white versions of the earphones.The existence of the\u0026nbspnew ear buds appeared to have been revealed by an upcoming iPhone update, which seemed to include references to features that are expected to arrive with AirPods 2.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That had many to hope that the company would hold one of its regular March events, and start selling many of those long-expected products.Apple will be holding one of those March events at its campus in California on 25 March, according to a new report from BuzzFeed. But those products won\u0027t be the central focus, according to the same report.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialInstead, the event will be headlined by Apple\u0027s news subscription service, which has been the subject of intense discussions between media organisations and the company. The new service is expected to allow users to pay a flat fee for news articles and other content, and then see that money split between Apple and the news outlets that people read.The event could also include other new subscription services. That could mean that Apple\u0027s long-rumoured TV and film subscription platform – a rival to Netflix and Amazon Prime – could also launch.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

It would be very rare for Apple to call a major release event of this kind and not launch a single new product.Everything we know about Apple\u0027s next iPhoneApple has been focusing more and more on subscriptions, which it sees as a way of continuing to generate revenue even after customers have bought its products. Its services business has been growingly rapidly and has become a central part of its financial updates, and it has launch a range of new paid services such as Apple Music in recent years.Apple usually holds three major events through the year. June\u0027s WWDC focuses on software updates and sometimes includes the launch of new services, a September event always serves as a the unveiling of the new iPhone, and the semi-regular March event usually hosts other products and often focuses on the iPad.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are likely to be negatively affected by any form of Brexit that removes the UK from the customs union but will be hit particularly hard if no agreement is ratified before 29 March.Investment in the British car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 as firms held back spending due to Brexit-related uncertainty. A precipitous decline in diesel sales caused by uncertainty about emissions regulations has also damaged the sector.Last week, Toyota slashed its profit forecast for 2019 and warned that it will be impossible to avoid the harmful effects of a no-deal Brexit.“We cannot avoid the negative impact no matter how much we prepare beforehand if Britain leaves the EU with no deal,” the firm’s senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said.The industry’s trade body this month said nothing had changed since the 2016 referendum to reassure car manufacturers about the prospects of investing in Britain. And they are “beyond frustrated” with politicians.UK car production fell 9.1 per cent to 1.52 million units in 2018, a five-year low for the sector.With eight out of 10 cars exported, weak demand in many markets, including the eurozone, the UK and China has depressed production.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray“There is a very real risk that a lack of clear, actionable information from government will leave firms, their people and their communities hung out to dry.” He added: “Even those companies trying their hardest to get ready are still in the dark on important matters from contracts through to customs. Many others, who took the decision to wait for the political process to conclude before acting, would face sudden and costly adjustments if a deal is not reached.“It is little wonder that many firms have been holding back on investment, stockpiling, and even opening offices and moving operations and jobs elsewhere. The imperative remains to avoid a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March, but businesses need answers they can base decisions on, no matter the outcome. The lack of clear, precise answers is now causing real damage to many businesses, and to the wider economy.”The questions put together by the BCC are as follows: What tariffs will my company need to pay when importing goods to the UK from the EU and rest of the world?When will the UK Government launch an official market access database to provide this information?If any trade agreements with third countries are operational on the day after Brexit, what rules of origin will I need to comply with?Will I still be able to fly people andor goods between the UK and the EU after Brexit day – or could travel be disrupted?I know I will need to register for an EORI number. How simple will it be for me to register for any other new registration requirements or processes?How will my lead times be impacted by new customs procedures?Will any of the EU-FTA agreements be rolled over or replaced on a bilateral basis in the event of no deal?Will I be able to use any trade preferences with any markets?Will there be confirmation that I will be able to continue importing tariff free goods from developing and least developed countries under the generalised system of preferences (GSP) after 29 March, 2019?Will there be new safety and security requirements and inspections at the UK-EU border that my company will need to deal with? Where will inspections be held?What system will I be using to input customs data – will HMRC’s new Customs Declaration Service be ready in time for 29 March, 2019?What procedures will my company face trading between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?Will this be different to operating at any other UK border?Will staff spending longer than 90 out of 180 days in the EU be subject to further administration, costs or visas?Will my business be able to move skilled staff members between the UK and the EU after 29 March and if so, under what conditions?Will I need to become VAT-registered in every EU Member State where my firm has clients?Which regulator will be overseeing my business after 29 March, 2019, and what rules do I need to follow?Is the UK government going to charge businesses for the creation of new regulatory agencies in the UK?If my company is in dispute with another in the EU, what form of resolution and means of redress will be available to my business after 29 March, 2019?Will my business have to pay roaming charges in the EU after 29 March, 2019?Will my business continue to be able to hold and transfer data and personal information without any interruptions after 29 March, 2019?We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It was hastily signed despite Seaborne having no ferries, no track record and no contracts with ports at either end of its proposed Ramsgate-to-Ostend route.Weeks after Grayling\u0027s department quietly released the contract notification on Christmas Eve, he announced it had been\u0026nbspcancelled, ostensibly because potential backer Arklow Shipping\u0026nbsphad walked away.How did the ‘no-boats’ ferry contract\u0026nbsphappen?The public spending watchdog released a memo this week on the DfT’s procurement of extra ferry capacity.It found the DfT had struggled to generate any interest from ferry companies to run the extra services. Perhaps as a result of this, the DfT\u0026nbspoffered what looked like a sweetener for the Seaborne deal.The contract promised £3m to the Tory-run council in Thanet\u0026nbspto cover the cost of preparing\u0026nbspthe little-used port of Ramsgate for freight ferries, which hadn’t run a service since the last operator collapsed in 2013.\u0026nbspThe contract would not go ahead without this money. Grayling had assured the Commons that no taxpayers’ money would be spent unless services started. But a dredger, estimated to cost at least £14,000 a day for a month, was clearing the harbour on Wednesday despite no contract being in place.The DfT says it is not paying for it, but it is unclear why or how a private company with no known customers would fund the work unless public backing had been assured.\u0026nbspThe council postponed voting on its budget at the eleventh hour last week after a call from Chris Grayling. Local sources speculate the transport secretary made renewed promises of funding. The DfT would not comment on any assurances.In truth Seaborne Freight is merely one window into the DfT’s handling of the options for air, land and sea routes between the UK and EU after Brexit.The NAO’s memo revealed that Grayling’s department, tasked with preparing the nation\u0027s trade routes, was itself woefully underprepared.The shipless ferry contract isn’t Grayling’s only recent failureLabour demands May sack Grayling amid claims he misled parliamentGrayling’s incompetence sends the worst message about Brexit BritainThe DfT only realised in September that there was an urgent need for more capacity to prevent significant no-deal Brexit disruption at Channel ports supplying more than a fifth of the UK’s goods.It decided not to go through the normal open tender process and instead contacted nine ferry operators privately and asked them to bid.Only three did so. All of them were awarded contracts, but the amount of capacity secured was less than half of what the DfT had hoped.\u0026nbspDespite Theresa May\u0027s claims in the Commons on Wednesday that full due diligence was carried out there was almost no time for checks.\u0026nbspThat didn\u0027t prevent Deloitte, Mott MacDonald and Slaughter and May\u0026nbspcollecting\u0026nbsp£800,000 between them for their advice on the procurement process.But in terms of due dilligence Slaughter and May carried out only a rudimentary “blush test” which checked things like Companies House records. Mott MacDonald and Deloitte both flagged concerns with the latter stating that it was not possible to conduct financial checks on a company with no financial history.Created with Sketch.

And the contracts may never even go ahead if a deal is agreed.\u0026nbspHow much does this matter?These sums are trivial compared to the vast damage that could be wrought by a chaotic no-deal Brexit. The DfT put the cost of six months of disruption at ports without intervention at £5.25bn, others put it higher.A charitable analysis of Grayling\u0027s performance would say that the minister is dealing with a unique\u0026nbspset of circumstances under immense time pressure.However, given what we now know about Seaborne Frieght, what might be uncovered elsewhere\u0026nbspif hundreds of other Brexit preparedness contracts were subject to the same level of scrutiny?\u0026nbspTo take one example, what has happened to the £29m earmarked for Operation Brock Grayling’s plan to turn much of East Kent into an emergency lorry park?Kent county councillor Paul Messenger says many of the roads to be resurfaced as part of the plan simply don’t need it.\u0026nbspThis is just a tiny fraction of the £2bn awarded by government departments in December to get ready for life outside the EU.It seems hopeful to think that the rest has been allocated any more efficiently.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The government has admitted it has run out of time for no-deal Brexit supplies and the ports are in no position to cope with what\u0027s coming.\u0026nbspYes, inflation fell, but cheaper energy played a big role and prices are going back up as a result of Ofgem raising its price cap. So it won’t last.\u0026nbspBut wait, we’re not here to criticise. We’re here to sing that Monty Python song, “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”. So here\u0027s one big consolation from the current mess. However it ends, it should once and for all nail the Tories’ claim to economic competence, or any form of competence come to think of it.\u0026nbspThere is a subset of people that will vote for them because of that. You’ll hear them saying things like, “well I know they\u0027re b******s, but at least they\u0027re b******s that know what they\u0027re doing”.\u0026nbspRight now they\u0027re proving themselves to be just b******s, without even the redeeming feature of being good at it.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding recent polls, that might make it a lot harder for them to get elected than previously when people look at the \u0027Conservative Party Candidate\u0027 under the name of their local MP, particularly if he or she is one of the Brexitremists Prime Minister\u0026nbspMay is in hock to.\u0026nbspIf you have two bad options, but one pays at least lip service to caring about the sick, the poor, the disabled, schools, hospitals etc while\u0026nbspthe other is just\u0026nbspflat out rubbish and mean with it, well, you do the maths.\u0026nbspStill not much of a fan of the Corbynistas, who could be\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspbeneficiaries of this? Well here’s a consolation especially for you, courtesy of Ford’s warning that it will do whatever is necessary to protect itself from May’s hard Brexit.\u0026nbspThat will inevitably mean shutting down car plants and throwing people out of jobs.\u0026nbspFord\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspfar from the only car company set to swing the axe.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing good about being chucked out of a job. It\u0027s\u0026nbsphorrible. I speak from personal experience.\u0026nbspBut it will mean less members and perhaps\u0026nbspless influence for Unite’s Len McCluskey. He’s been palling around with May and Business Secretary Greg Clark of late, and is seen as one of the chief blocks to\u0026nbspLabour doing what it should do and supporting a final say vote, which is about the only thing that could save us from this godawful mess.\u0026nbspSlim pickings, it has to be said, but I did tell you I was taking uber strong happy pills. Wait, I\u0027m feeling the full effect now.\u0026nbspSo maybe Len’s members will be alright after all. Maybe Ford’s warning, and that of the BCC, puts some backbone into the limited number of Tories who are still possessed of a little sanity and actually care about their country.\u0026nbspClark is supposed to be one of them. There are allegedly up to 20 ministers who, we are told, have threatened to walk if May moves to drop the hammer on every last one of us.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

But so was ‘kicking the can down the road’ with respect to its future.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDebenhams may close 90 stores, putting 10,000 jobs at riskM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesAnyhoo, Debs will pay Libor interest rates plus 5 per cent. This is a bridging loan and it’s priced like one. There are provisions for that price to go up if a more permanent solution to the company’s problems doesn’t get found quickly, so the can can’t be kicked for long. If that looks a lot\u0026nbsplike Brexit to you, you wouldn\u0027t be alone in drawing the parallel.\u0026nbspMike Ashley, the\u0026nbspbiggest shareholder via his Sports Direct, offered a similar sum interest free over Christmas. The problem is that it came with strings.\u0026nbspI imagine the group’s other shareholders would prefer the devils they know among their lenders if the alternative is Ashley’s deep blue sea, regardless of the high price they’re exacting.\u0026nbspBut the company might still end up there. It is hobbled by more than £500m of debt and a lot of underperforming stores with high rents that it needs to close.\u0026nbspThe shares’ rapturous response to the lifeline needs to be put in context. Debenhams has become catnip to short sellers betting on its demise, not to mention other gamblers hoping to make a turn on the stock market rollercoaster companies in this sort of situation tend to ride.\u0026nbspSome of them will have closed out their positions as a result of the financing\u0026nbspit has secured, helping to push the shares sharply higher. But future for investors with a time horizon longer than five minutes is cloudy indeed.At about £50m, Debenhams’ market value is less than a tenth of its debt, which it needs to reduce. The options for doing that include some type of debt for equity swap, or a company voluntary arrangement, which is a form of insolvency.\u0026nbspInvestors are going to get clobbered whatever finally emerges. They’ve been squabbling with each other, and Ashley managed to get CEO Sergio Bucher, who must wish he’d stayed put at Amazon, booted off the board a while back.\u0026nbspThe company is in a bad situation, going into talks abut its future with a bad hand while its stakeholders are bitterly ided. Questions about its long term future persist, and confidence in the people running the show isn’t high.

I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.During a private conversation between business leaders and the prime minister this week Ford said it was preparing alternative sites abroad, The\u0026nbspTimes\u0026nbspreported.It is the latest in a string of dire warnings from Britain’s car industry and comes just days after Nissan\u0026nbspU-turned on a decision to build its new X-Trail\u0026nbspin Sunderland, opting for Japan instead.Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) announced last month that it would slash 4,500 jobs as it makes radical cost savings in the face of plunging demand for diesel cars and a slowdown in China.Ford\u0026nbsphad already warned last month that a no-deal Brexit would cost it $1bn (£775m).\u0026nbspThe company confirmed this month that 370 voluntary redundancies would take place at its Bridgend plant\u0026nbspas part of measures to create a “sustainably profitable business” in Europe.Jaguar owner posts thumping loss in another blow to UK car industry Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata makes record-breaking loss of £3bnNissan’s decision shows what we’ll miss out on post-Brexit Nissan has been betrayed by Brexit ideologues like Jacob Rees-MoggCar industry workers want to leave the EUDespite being the UK’s best-selling car brand, Ford has struggled to consistently make a profit in Europe for years.Vehicle makers support 850,000 UK jobs and have issued repeated warnings about the impact of Brexit. They are likely to be negatively affected by any form of Brexit that removes the UK from the customs union but will be hit particularly hard if no agreement is ratified before 29 March.Investment in the British car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 as firms held back spending due to Brexit-related uncertainty. A precipitous decline in diesel sales caused by uncertainty about emissions regulations has also damaged the sector.Last week, Toyota slashed its profit forecast for 2019 and warned that it will be impossible to avoid the harmful effects of a no-deal Brexit.“We cannot avoid the negative impact no matter how much we prepare beforehand if Britain leaves the EU with no deal,” the firm’s senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said.The industry’s trade body this month said nothing had changed since the 2016 referendum to reassure car manufacturers about the prospects of investing in Britain. And they are “beyond frustrated” with politicians.UK car production fell 9.1 per cent to 1.52 million units in 2018, a five-year low for the sector.With eight out of 10 cars exported, weak demand in many markets, including the eurozone, the UK and China has depressed production.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

A list of 20 of the most burning questions businesses have has been put together by the British Chambers of Commerce, which said that many of the unanswered questions “reflect fundamental aspects of how companies operate”.The list comes days after a number of the UK’s biggest food and drink companies threatened to stop cooperating with the government on anything that is not connected to Brexit.

Many others, who took the decision to wait for the political process to conclude before acting, would face sudden and costly adjustments if a deal is not reached.“It is little wonder that many firms have been holding back on investment, stockpiling, and even opening offices and moving operations and jobs elsewhere. The imperative remains to avoid a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March, but businesses need answers they can base decisions on, no matter the outcome. The lack of clear, precise answers is now causing real damage to many businesses, and to the wider economy.”The questions put together by the BCC are as follows: What tariffs will my company need to pay when importing goods to the UK from the EU and rest of the world?When will the UK Government launch an official market access database to provide this information?If any trade agreements with third countries are operational on the day after Brexit, what rules of origin will I need to comply with?Will I still be able to fly people andor goods between the UK and the EU after Brexit day – or could travel be disrupted?I know I will need to register for an EORI number. How simple will it be for me to register for any other new registration requirements or processes?How will my lead times be impacted by new customs procedures?Will any of the EU-FTA agreements be rolled over or replaced on a bilateral basis in the event of no deal?Will I be able to use any trade preferences with any markets?Will there be confirmation that I will be able to continue importing tariff free goods from developing and least developed countries under the generalised system of preferences (GSP) after 29 March, 2019?Will there be new safety and security requirements and inspections at the UK-EU border that my company will need to deal with? Where will inspections be held?What system will I be using to input customs data – will HMRC’s new Customs Declaration Service be ready in time for 29 March, 2019?What procedures will my company face trading between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?Will this be different to operating at any other UK border?Will staff spending longer than 90 out of 180 days in the EU be subject to further administration, costs or visas?Will my business be able to move skilled staff members between the UK and the EU after 29 March and if so, under what conditions?Will I need to become VAT-registered in every EU Member State where my firm has clients?Which regulator will be overseeing my business after 29 March, 2019, and what rules do I need to follow?Is the UK government going to charge businesses for the creation of new regulatory agencies in the UK?If my company is in dispute with another in the EU, what form of resolution and means of redress will be available to my business after 29 March, 2019?Will my business have to pay roaming charges in the EU after 29 March, 2019?Will my business continue to be able to hold and transfer data and personal information without any interruptions after 29 March, 2019?We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The headline inflation rate was widely expected to fall back to 1.9 per cent, with economic uncertainty linked to Brexit and global trade tensions keeping prices down. The Office for National Statistics Consumer Prices Index showed that the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate came from electricity, gas and other fuels, although these were partially offset by air fares, which decreased at a lower rate than the year before.

The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceHowever, he warned: “This might not last long. As Brexit uncertainty continues to grip the nation it’s hard to be certain which way inflationary pressures will swing. While there is a little breathing space, people should consider how to best shield their money.”Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: “Despite the UK labour market remaining tight, political and economic uncertainty have held prices down. “With oil prices low on the back of weaker global demand and air fares tumbling, inflation has kept close to the Bank of England’s target.”She added: “The sluggish UK economy is symptomatic of the wider picture. Central banks across the globe have taken their foot off the stimulus pedal and we are now seeing the results. “With idiosyncratic issues in both the US and Europe slowing growth, Brexit affecting the UK, trade disputes, and a Chinese slowdown, we’re indisputably in a mid-cycle slowdown. “A global recession seems a far-flung prospect, however, in the UK, Carney must be flexible and data-driven, putting decisive monetary policy on the back burner until greater political and economic clarity emerges.” We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It claims to be the longest and most outstanding lateral flat - ones that stretch the full width of a building, or sometimes across two buildings - currently for sale in London’s West End.1115  Gatti House: the flats with celebrity links and private pizza lift that sold for a collective £16.5 millionCelebrity links, a famous history and a private “pizza lift” has helped set a new record for price per square foot for a block of flats in central London. The four flats have sold for a collective £16.5 million at Gatti House on London’s Strand. Gatti House, a magnificent grade II building built in 1867, was sold as four separate apartments priced from £2.95 million to £5.95 million by CBRE Residential and Beauchamp, which has completed the last remaining sale.CBRE Residential and BeauchampA newly refurbished office in the heart of Mayfair measuring 6,000 sq ft was unveiled by Enstar Capital in October. At £500 per sq ft, it is set to be the most expensive commercial fit out ever undertaken in the West End, according to the developer. The workspace on 54 Brooks Mews features gold-plated executive washrooms inspired by Armani-hotel in Italy, timber flooring imported from a 16th century monastery in Tuscany and an Art Deco entrance restored with a new “54” entrance logo replicating Steve Rubell’s famous “studio 54” nightclub logo from the seventies. While the director’s floor include a rooftop terrace dressed with loungers and an outside meeting and dining table.1315 Former garage in Mayfair become world’s most expensive mews house at £24m in Mayfair In September, the world’s most expensive mews house, in Reevews Mews, sold to a Qatari buyer for an eye-watering £24 million.1415 A penthouse where you canoe from your front door, yours for £16.95 million London luxury dockside complex located on Chelsea creek is due for completion by the end of 2016. But its luxury flats are already on sale including this penthouse yours for £16.95 million. It’s future residents will be able to slip down the river for a work out on the water at anytime of the day. 1515  The only property in London too expensive for the city’s super-rich property buyersA 45 bed-room mansion near Hyde Park, previously owned by a Saudi Prince, received a private bid for £280 million. If accepted this would have made the property he most expensive single home ever to be sold in Britain. It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.But from 20 March, the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act will amend 1985 legislation\u0026nbspand make landlords more accountable for conditions in their homes.“Crucially, the bill will help private and social renter’s voices to be heard, by giving them the right to take their landlord to court over unfit and unsafe conditions like these in their home,” Shelter said.Landlords will have to make sure their properties meet certain standards at the beginning and throughout a tenancy. For the first time this will include problems caused by defective design –\u0026nbspsuch as lack of ventilation or infestations of vermin and insects –\u0026nbsprather than disrepair.\u0026nbspIssues tenants can take action onDrainage and sanitary conveniencesFacilities for preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste waterHazards under the Housing Health and Safety Rating SystemThe new rules also include\u0026nbspa so-called Grenfell clause, which allows tenants to take action over common areas in shared buildings.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter said: “The Fitness for Human Habitation Act will give all types of renters the power they need to tackle bad conditions – which is why Shelter campaigned hard for it to be passed as law.“With more and more families renting privately, we desperately need more protections and security for renters.“The act will help enforce best practice for landlords and agents, act as a deterrent for bad behaviour, and provide a legal lever for renters to pull if their landlord isn’t complying.”The number of people renting their home in the UK has increased dramatically over the last decade as buying a house in certain areas has become less affordable.But UK laws have remained relatively lax on landlords and provided little security for tenants.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The headline inflation rate was widely expected to fall back to 1.9 per cent, with economic uncertainty linked to Brexit and global trade tensions keeping prices down. The Office for National Statistics Consumer Prices Index showed that the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate came from electricity, gas and other fuels, although these were partially offset by air fares, which decreased at a lower rate than the year before.

The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceHowever, he warned: “This might not last long. As Brexit uncertainty continues to grip the nation it’s hard to be certain which way inflationary pressures will swing. While there is a little breathing space, people should consider how to best shield their money.”Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: “Despite the UK labour market remaining tight, political and economic uncertainty have held prices down. “With oil prices low on the back of weaker global demand and air fares tumbling, inflation has kept close to the Bank of England’s target.”She added: “The sluggish UK economy is symptomatic of the wider picture. Central banks across the globe have taken their foot off the stimulus pedal and we are now seeing the results. “With idiosyncratic issues in both the US and Europe slowing growth, Brexit affecting the UK, trade disputes, and a Chinese slowdown, we’re indisputably in a mid-cycle slowdown. “A global recession seems a far-flung prospect, however, in the UK, Carney must be flexible and data-driven, putting decisive monetary policy on the back burner until greater political and economic clarity emerges.” We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

For the first time this will include problems caused by defective design –\u0026nbspsuch as lack of ventilation or infestations of vermin and insects –\u0026nbsprather than disrepair.\u0026nbspIssues tenants can take action onDrainage and sanitary conveniencesFacilities for preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste waterHazards under the Housing Health and Safety Rating SystemThe new rules also include\u0026nbspa so-called Grenfell clause, which allows tenants to take action over common areas in shared buildings.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter said: “The Fitness for Human Habitation Act will give all types of renters the power they need to tackle bad conditions – which is why Shelter campaigned hard for it to be passed as law.“With more and more families renting privately, we desperately need more protections and security for renters.“The act will help enforce best practice for landlords and agents, act as a deterrent for bad behaviour, and provide a legal lever for renters to pull if their landlord isn’t complying.”The number of people renting their home in the UK has increased dramatically over the last decade as buying a house in certain areas has become less affordable.But UK laws have remained relatively lax on landlords and provided little security for tenants.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Adam Lusher meets themClick to followThe Independent‘Shiny ornaments in the town centre’: The EU-funded ‘Heart of the Furnace’ sculpture, with the signs for BrightHouse and Poundstretcher behindThis was the crucible that drove the industrial revolution, once.It was a valley blessed with mineral wealth in abundance, enough for men to dig out\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspmillion tons of coal a year.The\u0026nbspsteelworks in Ebbw Vale could lay claim to being the biggest in Europe: 11,000 people working there in the 1960s, amid “the noise from the tinplate lines, the smell of acid used to clean steel coils, the sight of a hot ingot, as bright as the sun, being reduced to a thin steel slab”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAs one of its former MPs would recall, in Blaenau Gwent, in the south Wales valleys, the work was hard – and dangerous – but it built communities.Wales might not get as much money from Brexit as it did from the EUYet the steelworks have gone, demolished in 2002. The mines have shut.Marine was the last pit to go, closed in 1989.\u0026nbspIts only visible remains lie in a patch of wasteland beyond a dead-end road.\u0026nbspTwo large wheels rise above the ground.\u0026nbspOnce they were in constant motion, bringing up the coal and sending down the men to work in a pit that operated around the clock. The wheels have been sawn in half, encased in concrete, immobilised forever.\u0026nbspInstead of the sounds of work, there is silence.Where once Blaenau Gwent was full of the signs of heavy industry, now it is peppered with signs of a different kind: showing the stars of the\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspflag, promising economic rebirth, offering uplifting slogans about “investing in your future”.And herein lies the paradox. Blaenau Gwent is in the heart of a region, the south Wales valleys, that has received\u0026nbspsome £4bn of EU funding over 20 years, and yet it is also the local council area that recorded Wales’s heaviest Leave vote, with 62 per cent backing Brexit in 2016.Reporters have visited from London, minds boggling at the place “showered with EU cash” that voted Leave, concluding – some of them – that the people here must be Brexit\u0026nbsp“turkeys who voted for Christmas”.They are not hard to find, these “turkeys”. You just back out of the dead-end road leading to the remains of Marine colliery and drive for a few minutes to the Legion pub in\u0026nbspCwm, where, for the benefit of the lunchtime drinkers, the widescreen TV is tuned to a radio station playing the hits of yesteryear.Dale Owen, 47, was a boy when the miners went on strike and the last pits closed under the government of Margaret Thatcher.\u0026nbspToo young to follow his father and grandfather down the pit, he became a painter and decorator.“I’m fed up and I voted out,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Year in, year out, we get poorer.\u0026nbspThey closed all the pits, closed the steelworks.\u0026nbspWhat are we left with?\u0026nbspA few food factories, and streets where shops are closing down left, right and centre.”“Where’s it all gone?” he asks, when you mention the EU money.\u0026nbsp“Regeneration projects?\u0026nbspWhere’s the regeneration? We’ve had 40-odd years of the EU.\u0026nbspI thought, f***\u0026nbspit, have a change.\u0026nbspIt can’t get any worse.”Mix in a few comments from others, about having to take rules from countries that have “forgotten who liberated them” during the war, and you have what could be portrayed as the vote of irrational rage, biting the EU hand trying to feed them.There’s just one big problem with such dismissiveness: even someone who played a big part in getting EU money to Blaenau Gwent sympathises with what Owen and others are saying.\u0026nbspIn the 1990s, Victoria Winckler was a leading member of the taskforce that secured €1.9bn\u0026nbsp(£1.6bn) of EU funding for west Wales and the valleys, granted for the years 2000-06 on the basis that this area was one of the most deprived in Europe.Now, as the director of the Bevan Foundation think tank, she has written that if the Welsh valleys were showered with cash, “it appears to have gone straight down the drain”.The woman who helped deliver the EU money says the Brexit-backers of Blaenau Gwent were not fools\u0026nbspthey were people who “voted for the better future that the EU had failed to deliver”.Confessing her own disillusion, Dr Winckler tells The Independent: “You can point to a number of shiny EU projects.\u0026nbsp You can say, ‘Oh look, you have got a dual carriageway, some nice sculptures in your town centre.’\u0026nbsp“But that has not made a material difference to people’s lives. They are still struggling to find work, struggling to make ends meet.”To call these people turkeys voting for Christmas, she says, is patronising: “It makes the assumption that EU funding is always good, and people who had it but still voted Leave must be stupid. It blames people who took a rational decision.”Winckler is backed by Professor Roger Awan-Scully of Cardiff University, who has extensively researched the Leave vote in the valleys.He thinks they took what, from their perspective, was a pretty rational decision: “People who felt they had nothing left to lose, rolled the die and tried change.”Or, as one senior Remain campaigner said in the bitter aftermath of defeat:\u0026nbspfor these people, fear of Brexit bringing economic disaster “wasn’t credible, because they felt their lives were already s***”.That, she says, just made it even more tempting to blame “that lot over there with their bent bananas”.“The EU,” says Winckler, “has been wrongly blamed for all the ills that have affected Blaenau Gwent and other areas like it. There was a failure of UK government policy, from all parties, a long-term restructuring of the UK economy in which, to generalise very crudely, the regions were left to wither and die, while London and the south prospered.\u0026nbspOn top of which came a thick layer of austerity”.But both Awan-Scully and Winckler are pretty scathing about the Remain campaign as fought in 2016.Perhaps, then, if a Final Say referendum ever materialises from the current chaos – and perhaps even if it doesn’t – some lessons should be learned from what are called, with maybe a whiff of condescension, “the left-behind communities”.At HQ level there might also have to be an understanding of what happened when, as one campaigner put it, “Remain was fought in the spirit of a gentleman’s cricket match against a bunch of lunatics on day release from a life sentence of being themselves.”But as well as pointing to micro-targeted social media ads\u0026nbspand broken Brexit campaign spending limits, Remainers might want to look at how to fight a better ‘ground war’ – one that doesn’t complacently dismiss Leave voters in places like Blaenau Gwent fools.It is true that in Blaenau Gwent you can, if you look hard enough, find Brexit voters expressing, if not full-on “bregret”, then at least ambivalence over how they were sold what Winckler calls the Leave campaign’s “very simple and attractive promises”.But it does seem that for every Andrew, you can find a Steven Roberts, 57, of the Cwmglo Jewellery and Fashion shop, cafe\u0026nbspand art gallery.“I voted Remain,” he says, “But if I had to choose now, I would probably vote Leave. Over the past 30 to 40 years, Blaenau Gwent and the south Wales valleys have been absolutely devastated – raped and left to rot.“The people here have been shafted for so long.\u0026nbspIf we leave, we can’t do any worse than we are doing at the moment. We are not turkeys. We are desperate people. Very desperate.”Everyone here knows about the EU funding. Everyone derides it. The ungrateful natives even have the temerity to mock the shiny new roads that were built for them.The Heads of the Valley dual carriageway, upgraded with £79m of EU money, is dismissed as “the Blaenau Gwent bypass, the fast road out to the Midlands”, useless for low-wage workers trying to get to work when bus services are “always being cut”.“They’ve showered us with cash and it’s gone on the wrong things,” says a woman at\u0026nbspthe food bank, in Beaufort, a village above Ebbw Vale.Created with Sketch.

Now with her chemotherapy finished, Sarah faces reconstructive surgery and a massive drop in her employment support allowance. Hence the food bank trip.“There’s nothing left for people in Ebbw Vale,” she says. “No future for my children, no secure jobs, just zero-hours contracts.\u0026nbspMy 19-year-old hasn’t had a full-time, settled job since he left school. He’s suffering with depression.”All the signs are that mental illness is on the rise in Blaenau Gwent, while average male wages have stagnated since the steelworks shut. By the time of the referendum, a man on median wages was £71 a week worse off in real terms than in the early 2000s.People with jobs sometimes have to resort to the food bank. Some families need charitable assistance before they can send their children to school in proper shoes and uniforms.And, according to Sarah, to a community at “rock bottom”, in urgent need of economic resuscitation, the EU money has bought “shiny ornaments in the town centre”.Everyone tells you about the shiny dragon in Ebbw Vale town centre. It is reached by walking up the main street, past signs of rampant fuel poverty blighting an area once famous for coal production: “Pay gas and electric here” says the note in the window of Cash \u0026amp Xchange.\u0026nbsp“Sell your stuff, buy it back later, for cash when you need it,” promises Cash Generator.And then, after just two vape shops, the dragon is there: rising 13ft\u0026nbsphigh on its hind legs, a glittering vision of resurgent power fired by the past glories referenced in the artwork’s title:\u0026nbspHeart of the Furnace.“Yet another positive example of how Welsh government and EU funds are benefiting the region,” was the verdict of Jane Hutt, the Welsh government finance minister who unveiled it in 2014.If you look at the background, you can see that the dragon is flanked on one side by a sign for BrightHouse\u0026nbspand on the other by a banner for Poundstretcher, neither suggestive of an economy roaring back to greatness.Of course, some of the results of local council, Welsh government and EU regeneration funding are, as Winckler and others point out, invisible to the naked eye.Considerable amounts of money have, for example, been spent on apprenticeships. In other words, you can choose how to interpret the banner outside the new Ebbw Vale Sports Centre, built on part of the old steelworks site.\u0026nbspThe banner advertises “Bridges Into Work 2”, free training for the over-25s and unemployed, thanks to money from the European Social Fund.Perhaps this shows the EU properly addressing Blaenau Gwent’s underlying problems. But it could also be read as a confession that a shiny new sports centre cannot replace the jobs lost when the steelworks shut – even if the new building gets listed on the internet as “a modern leisure hub with a pool and water slides”.There is a similar ambivalence about the £21m Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, the new “super-school” that also occupies part of the old steelworks site.In the Cwm Legion, Owen talks proudly of “going skint to put my daughter in university”. But then he adds: “I told her to get out of this area. I don’t want her struggling like I did. There is no future for kids here. They turn to drink or drugs.”He is not the only one asking what lies in store for their children once they leave their shiny new super-school. They all know this isn’t just the EU’s fault. Many are more angry at local politicians, for a perceived lack of strategic vision in spending the money, than they are about the EU that granted the funds.In the former constituency of Aneurin Bevan, the people of Blaenau Gwent dismiss nearly all modern politicians as hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their community.“They might as well live on the moon as far as I am concerned,” says Sarah in the food bank.She talks of backing Brexit as “a rebellion. We had just had enough. The system had to change.”You do worry, though, about how, post-Brexit, “the system”\u0026nbspmight change for the even worse. How would money be found to help places like Blaenau Gwent if “rolling the die”\u0026nbspand voting Leave pushed the entire British economy into a no-deal, cliff-edge Brexit? Who in a post-Brexit UK would be strong enough to defend some of the values that are central to EU membership?\u0026nbspRather pointedly, Winckler stresses “the EU’s fairness role, which means one country can’t undercut another in terms of how it treats its workers”.The people of Blaenau Gwent are smart enough to see through the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, men not exactly known for their instinctive understanding of, or sympathy for, the struggling ex-miner or former steelworker.History valley- where the revival was bornNissan has been betrayed by Brexit ideologues like Jacob Rees-MoggBut, given the hand dealt them by many conventional politicians over many decades, you can’t be entirely surprised by the response when you ask about the risks of being delivered into the clutches of Brexiteers who arguably couldn’t care less about them.“Nobody else cares about us either,” says Roberts.If you are a Remainer hoping to win a second referendum, you might have to consider whether he has a point.If you are seeking “turkeys”, you might like to wonder whether, come Brexit, no Brexit or Theresa May compromise, a community that helped make Britain “great” deserves much better – from its own government as much as the EU – than more of the same\u0026nbspand a shiny dragon.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders.\u0026nbspReally, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey with Iron Man and moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes setting up the next movie, plus this\u0026nbspgives the series the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHowever, many fans have taken to watching the movies in chronological order.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together as a self-contained film. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan Horse for future Avengers films. When the Thor franchise lost its director, Kenneth Branagh, between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, hell-bent on acquiring the Aether, one of an endless stream of apparent doomsday devices in this universe, all while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling version of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story for a terribly drawn out Jekyll and Hyde copycat. 420 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment exemplary of how much Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and there’s a delight to how heightened an air Branagh lends to Loki’s plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins). Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marvel debut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 720 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a rag-tag bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to eleven, cramming in a half-dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all” to the world, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A magical moment amongst the clutter.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the greater success story of Marvel Studios: it’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the Battle of New York finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary to each other. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film somehow remains first and foremost a Captain America film. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for its central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1020 Ant-Man and the WaspAvengers: Infinity War was a tough act to follow, but Marvel’s underdog franchise proved it wasn’t just a quick pit stop before the main event. While the first film played like a mirror image of its star, Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers would work – let alone become a blockbuster success. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb and takes the Marvel world just a little less seriously. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who might be a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also finally handing the centre stage over to the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos. Epic both in its sense of scale and in its stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finale’s in blockbuster history. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics – and had a film befitting those old-fashioned heroics to boot. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting for a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), a character who is never relegated to the role of damsel in distress. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, although The Russo Brothers root the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the Marvel Cinematic Universe came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation of the web-slinger swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high-school story allowing for intimate character-driven moments. There are some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out) and Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain (that twist!).While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arch to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his most. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Averngers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected a new dose of energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world – having been ostracised from Hollywood – but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other Cinematic Universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, has a self-contained story that only hints at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 1920 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a group of truly ragtag heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of Star Wars-esque, B-movie glee. It also transformed Park and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.  Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future, while ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking: utilising the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger to illustrate a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama. Iron Man 2 barely holds together as a self-contained film. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Released as part of Phase Three, the film\u0026nbsptakes place in the mid-Nineties (when Nick Fury still had\u0026nbspboth eyes)\u0026nbspand therefore lands in the Phase One chronology.\u0026nbspAll Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxy\u0026nbsp(2014)s of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u0026nbsp(2014)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of Ultron\u0026nbsp(2015)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)What went wrong for Netflix and Marvel?Summary: Phase Two also\u0026nbspplays out almost exactly in release order, except\u0026nbsps of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which\u0026nbspcomes directly after the first\u0026nbsps (like Captain Marvel, the film was released in Phase Three but actually takes place before then).\u0026nbspAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two as the Netflix shows and\u0026nbspAgents of Shield\u0026nbspwere introduced.\u0026nbspFor those who do embark on watching\u0026nbspAgents of Shield\u0026nbsp(the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as their cinematic counterparts\u0026nbsphave major effects on the show’s story.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield\u0026nbsp(season five, episodes 1 — 19)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Ant-Man and The Wasp\u0026nbsp(2017)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 20 - 22)Summery: Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance,\u0026nbspDoctor Strange\u0026nbspbegins before\u0026nbspCivil War, but finishes after\u0026nbspCivil War,\u0026nbspSlingshot\u0026nbspfeatures lots of flashbacks, and\u0026nbspAgents of Shield\u0026nbspseason five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also,\u0026nbspSpider-Man\u0026nbspboth takes place directly after\u0026nbspCivil War, while\u0026nbspRagnarok,\u0026nbspBlack Panther\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAnt-Man and The Wasp\u0026nbsplead directly into\u0026nbspAvengers: Infinity War\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s also the latter part of\u0026nbspShield\u0026nbspthat takes place concurrently with\u0026nbspInfinity War.\u0026nbspAbove is\u0026nbspjust a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed\u0026nbspover\u0026nbspnine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days!

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan Horse for future Avengers films. When the Thor franchise lost its director, Kenneth Branagh, between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, hell-bent on acquiring the Aether, one of an endless stream of apparent doomsday devices in this universe, all while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling version of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story for a terribly drawn out Jekyll and Hyde copycat. 420 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment exemplary of how much Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and there’s a delight to how heightened an air Branagh lends to Loki’s plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins). Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marvel debut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 720 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a rag-tag bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to eleven, cramming in a half-dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all” to the world, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A magical moment amongst the clutter.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the greater success story of Marvel Studios: it’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the Battle of New York finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary to each other. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film somehow remains first and foremost a Captain America film. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for its central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1020 Ant-Man and the WaspAvengers: Infinity War was a tough act to follow, but Marvel’s underdog franchise proved it wasn’t just a quick pit stop before the main event. While the first film played like a mirror image of its star, Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers would work – let alone become a blockbuster success. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb and takes the Marvel world just a little less seriously. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who might be a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also finally handing the centre stage over to the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos. Epic both in its sense of scale and in its stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finale’s in blockbuster history. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics – and had a film befitting those old-fashioned heroics to boot. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting for a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), a character who is never relegated to the role of damsel in distress. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, although The Russo Brothers root the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the Marvel Cinematic Universe came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation of the web-slinger swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high-school story allowing for intimate character-driven moments. There are some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out) and Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain (that twist!).While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arch to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his most. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Averngers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected a new dose of energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world – having been ostracised from Hollywood – but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other Cinematic Universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, has a self-contained story that only hints at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 1920 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a group of truly ragtag heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of Star Wars-esque, B-movie glee. It also transformed Park and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.  Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future, while ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking: utilising the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger to illustrate a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama. Iron Man 2 barely holds together as a self-contained film. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

He talked about, among other things, the effects of a slowdown in China. Then he placed Brexit in the context of broader upheavals stemming from globalisation. The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government“Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation,” Carney said.“It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy.”But crucially he then laid out a second point that has conveniently been left out of a number of accounts: “At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.”Carney’s approach here should not surprise anyone. He is an economist and a central banker, not a political pundit. In that role he doesn’t back one side of a debate or another he puts forward a range of possible outcomes, based on analysis.He is used to traders and market commentators poring over and dissecting his every word for a sign of where interest rates are heading, and so he deliberately gives little away.But what about that project fear doom-mongering in months gone by?As it happens, Carney\u0026nbspdidn’t say house prices would crash by 35 per cent or that GDP would drop 8 per cent in a year. In both cases he laid out a number of best, worst and middling scenarios.The middle scenario rarely makes for the best headline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But few people will feel the impact more sharply than the 3.5 million EU nationals who have built their lives in this country – and who are now having to take steps to secure their right to be here.The government has pledged that all EEA citizens (ie those from the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), their family members and dependents living in the UK on or before 29 March\u0026nbspcan remain in the country with no loss of their rights.The EU Settled Status Scheme, which opened fully last month, is designed to facilitate this, providing – in the words of Sajid Javid –\u0026nbspa “simple, streamlined process for residents and EU citizens and their family members to obtain their new UK immigration status”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut campaigners warn that it risks leaving thousands of EU nationals undocumented – and pushing them straight into the claws of the so-called “hostile environment”.The obligations on employers, landlords and doctors to make routine immigration checks under existing\u0026nbspmeasures mean that anyone who doesn’t obtain settled status before the deadline – 30 June 2021 – could suddenly find themselves unable to work, rent or access healthcare.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentOne of the main concerns is\u0026nbsplack of awareness.

the bright, spotted fur of most members of the species, are extremely rare in Africa and were not confirmed to be living in Kenya until now.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read

believed he had failed in his attempts to find a black leopard, until he checked the final rig.“I had a quick look at the last trap, not expecting to find much,” Mr Burrard-Lucas wrote on his blog.“As I scrolled through the images on the back of the camera, I paused and peered at the photograph below in incomprehension… a pair of eyes surrounded by inky darkness… a black leopard.“I couldn’t believe

Africa.They are thought to be the first conclusive proof of black leopards living on the continent since a series of photographs taken in Ethiopia in 1909.Black leopards are sometimes known as panthers, an umbrella term used to describe any\u0026nbspbig cat with melanism, the opposite of albinism.However, most are found in southeast Asia, where the gene variant provides extra camouflage under dense rainforest canopies.\u0026nbspThe new photographs form part of a\u0026nbsppaper by experts from the Institute of Conservation Research at San Diego Zoo, documenting confirmation of black leopards living in Laikipia.After presenting Mr Burrard-Lucas’s\u0026nbspphotographic evidence of the black panther to local conservationists, a second photo of a leopard with melanism hiding in grass purportedly taken in the area\u0026nbsp2007 was also handed to researchers.“Collectively these images are the first reported in nearly 100 years that confirm the existence of black leopard in Africa, and the first in Kenya,” the paper states.“Because the photograph is more than a decade older than the trail camera observations, it is likely that melanistic leopards are an established phenomenon in Laikipia county.”We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s why we have rigorous safety standards. But we are in danger of going overboard.The Tories must shake themselves out of their paralysis, and find a backbone.THE police appear to be missing in action in the case of odious “Sir” Philip Green.They usually can’t wait to jump into action when they can get an easy headline, nor do they spare any effort in virtue-signalling PR operations.And yet after thehas revealed lurid allegations about his conduct and serious questions about cover-ups, there’s hardly a dickie bird.The Government, too, must act.They have been shown in black and white how the rich and powerful continue to abuse expensive gagging orders to keep shameful behaviour private – no matter the public interest.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex.

Dont tell your mum.”Humberside Police are now investigating the incident, which happened on Newtondale at around .pm on January .Miss Hayward said: “I work with a lady with dementia and I’d picked the kids up from the school and left the car running outside while I went to drop her off at her home.“I said to the kids ‘you two just wait there, I’m going to take her in.’ I went to the house and then I heard a banging on the door before I saw my lad coming towards me crying and shaking.“I’d left the car running but they had the keys and everything with them when they were running towards me.After calming her children down, Miss Hayward asked what had happened and Cole revealed two men had approached the car.The siblings had quarrelled and Codie briefly stepped out of the car and at this point a man is believed to have come up to her and said: “Come on little girl, come with me. Dont tell your mum.”The terried schoolgirl then retreated to the car and Cole locked the doors so that neither of the men could get in to the vehicle.They waited for a minute until the men left before running to their mum.Miss Hayward said: “He came within an inch of her. She told me that when she was asked she said no and jumped straight back into the car.“At first, I went ‘don’t lie’ and it didn’t sink in until I got in the car, got home and sat them down to ask them what was wrong because my lad was still crying in the car.“That is when they told me and I rang the police straight away.“I was so shocked and upset because you don’t expect something like that to happen. I wasn’t angry and it was more of a shock.Police are still looking into the encounter, but Miss Hayward said it has had a huge impact on her two children, particularly Cole.Miss Hayward said: “My little girl is getting checked for autism so she has no fear for anything and everything goes over her head.“My lad was pure white after it happened.

Somehow, they’ll stop it.” I don’t think I was alone in reckoning that.It’s looking very much like that at the moment, isn’t it  We’re  days away from deadline time, March . But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so. They were never going to let it happen.”Congratulations to young Hartlepool lad Michael Rice for becoming our entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest.He’s singing a ditty called Love Is Really Lovely or something, and will come third from last, just above Kosovo and France.Michael Rice will represent the UK at Eurovision but will probably come third from lastBut bless him, at least he’ll be going.Far left, anti-Semitic bullies have been demanding we boycott the extravaganza because it’s in Israel.A bunch of C-list celebs wrote a letterinsisting we pull out.They said nothing when the contest was held in the repressive Islamic state of Azerbaijan.Good luck, Michael.

It spanned from morning to evening.“I told them that Zaharie is a smart guy.

We chitchat for a while, about half an hour or one hour.“He was a normal, jovial guy. I didn’t anticipate that some bad thing was going to happen. It was a big shock to me as well.”Mr Zulhaimi said the past five years has been dficult for the family as they came to terms with the pilot’s death.“The whole family has tried to forget about it,” he said. “We just accept the fact that he’s dead by now, I think.”It’s not the first time Captain Shah’s phone has been in the spotlight.Recently it was revealed the married captain sent more than  online messages to twin models Lan Qi Hui and Qi Min, begging them to visit him in Kuala Lumpur.The Sun reported how Shah plagued the young Instagram model twins, , with creepy messages before his plane’s mysterious disappearance four years ago.Now Qi Min Lan has told the Gold Coast Bulletin that the police spoke to her about Zaharie after his plane went missing."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000468880196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may promises fgm law blocked by sir christopher chope","story":"Sir Christopher Chope last week used parliamentary procedure to halt the draft law sponsored by fellow Tory MP Zac Goldsmith passing through Parliament.The bill proposed a change to child welfare laws that would have allowed courts to protect children at risk of FGM.It was intended to stop young kids being taken abroad by their parents to undergo the horric and permanently damaging procedure.But when it was announced in the Commons today, Sir Christopher shouted “object” - single-handedly stopping the law from going any further.It sparked a furious reaction from all parties - and yesterday the PM vowed to find government time to bring the bill back to the Commons.Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, Mrs May said: It’s only right that we find time for this bill and the Government will find time to deliver it.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ex-city worker Catherine Blaiklock moaned emergency handouts are full of “sweet custard and PopTarts” and people “cannot even be bothered to buy their hungry children an egg.The former UKIP candidate was named last week as the leader of the Brexit Party, which is supported by Nigel Farage and claims to have gained , supporters in its first  hours.Ms Blaiklock, who owns a guest house in Norfolk, made the comments last month in an article for The Conservative Woman website. She complained about the “contradiction” between stories of people going hungry and an obesity epidemic   In the article, titled Let them eat spuds, she claimed nutritious food in the UK is very cheap and available in vast quantities, but many people lead chaotic lives or cannot cook. She added: A visit to a food bank of the type that millions are supposed to rely on shows you the problem. It is full of cans of sweet custard and packets of PopTarts and the like. They do not stock raw potatoes because they might ‘go off’. She added: Food banks should stop, think and go back to the drawing board. Kind as they may be, they are not doing society or their beneficiaries any favours. They are creating a dependent, obese population. Teaching their recipients how to shop for raw ingredients and to cook ‘meat and two veg’ would be more helpful.  Margaret Greenwood, Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: These comments are distasteful and show just how out of touch this party really is. A Trussell Trust spokeswoman said the average user of the foodbank charity came just twice a year. Many foodbanks in our network do offer fresh food where they are able to safely store, a spokeswoman said. For example, fruit, vegetables, eggs and bread, and this is something we’re working with our network to develop further. Asked for comment by the Mirror, Ms Blaiklock said she was comparing the price of food in Nepal and the UK after living there and marrying a Nepalese man.  She added: [Anti-poverty campaigner] Jack Munroe has said exactly the same thing about simple basic cooking and was not criticised. Jamie Oliver has also said similar things. It comes after BuzzFeed News revealed earlier this week that Ms Blaiklock had made anti-Muslim comments in online articles. In one blog post about burqas she wrote: There are currently  majority Muslim countries in the world. If these people really dislike it so much in the West, why do they chose to live here  In another article she wrote: There is also some truth in the statement that Muslim men were impregnating white British girls to create Muslim babies”.

Eurosceptic MPs were furious they are being forced to vote on a Government motion that they claimed would commit her to avoiding a no-deal Brexit . The vote, while not legally binding, gives MPs another chance to have their say on the Prime Minister’s Brexit plans. They will be asked to confirm they still back the approach to leaving the EU that was passed by a stormy Commons on January . MPs backed an amendment that forced Mrs May to try to renegotiate the controversial Irish border backstop with Brussels.   But on the same day, they also passed one which ruled out crashing out without a Brexit deal. Several MPs in the hardline European Reform Group have warned Tory whips that they will not support the PM’s plan. Mark Francois, ERG vice-chair, said: “We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels... It is madness.” But the PM’s official spokesman said: “No-deal is an eventuality we wish to avoid, but one we continue to plan for. Does no-deal remain on the table  The answer is yes.” It came as Government ministers were desperately back-pedalling over claims the PM was running down the clock to blackmail MPs with the threat of a no deal. Her top Brexit aide Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar claiming MPs would get a last-minute choice to back the PM’s Brexit plan - or delay Brexit day.   Mrs May dismissed his remarks as “something said by someone  overheard by someone  in a bar”. She added: “We want to leave with a deal. That is what we are working for.” Senior Tories scrambled to insist that Brexit would happen on time. Tory vice-chairman Chris Philp said: “What a civil servant might speculate in a bar after a few drinks is frankly not that important.” Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer accused the PM of brinkmanship - and warned of a “concerted” cross-party effort to get an extensionher deal fails. He threw the party’s weight behind a new version of Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s plan to delay Brexit.   MPs could also get a vote on an amendment by veteran Tory Ken Clarke to allow MPs to vote for their preferred Brexit outcome. More cross-party talks took place today with Sir Keir and Labour’s Jon Trickett meeting Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and de facto deputy PM David Lidington. Meanwhile Labour faced a new split over whether to swing behind a second EU referendum. Sir Keir was slapped down by the leadership after suggesting a general election - Labour’s preferred option - was no longer viable. He said a second referendum was the only “credible option” leftLabour’s favoured Brexit deal can’t be agreed.   Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admitted to the Mirror it would now be “very dficult” to secure an election. The Shadow Chancellor said: If we can’t get our deal through Parliament, [we’ve] kept the option on the table of going back to the people in a public vote. Our preference is a general election, butthat’s not available to us, yeah, a People’s Vote. “At the moment it’s very dficult to seewe could a general election, we know that. So therefore, yes, maybewe can’t get our deal through Parliament, we’d go back to the people again. At a later event, Mr McDonnell added: “We are still in hope of a general election but it’s unlikely.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk russia talks replace 23","story":"NewsUK and Russia in talks to replace  expelled diplomats claims Putin criticProminent Putin critic Bill Browder attacked the Government over its response to the Skripal poisoning last MarchShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB NewsBill Browder has attacked the Government over its response to the Salisbury Novichok poisoning \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain and Russia are in talks to replace the  diplomats expelled from the UK in the wake of the Salisbury Novichok attack, MPs have heard. Prominent Putin critic Bill Browder attacked the Government over its response to the poisoning last March. The attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal left him and his daughter Yulia critically ill, and resulted in the death of Dawn Sturgess in July who was later exposed to the same nerve agent.In the wake of the attack, Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion of  Russian diplomats, calling the incident an “unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the UK”.At the time the government suggested expulsions were just the start of the actions they were prepared to take, but they are now rowing back even on that. Appearing before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Mr Browder criticised Britain’s lack of action. “What has happened   diplomats were expelled from this country and nothing . Nothing ,” Mr Browder told the cross-party committee.   “The United States sanctioned people, and sanctioned Russia for using chemical weapons in Salisbury, and the chemical weapons attack didn’t occur in the United States, it occurred in Great Britain. “But this country has not done anything. By the way, there is now negotiations for  more Russian diplomats to . “So, in the end, with exception of this expulsion of diplomats, there have been no consequences for Russia committing an atrocity in Salisbury.” Conservative Bob Seely is pushing for legislation to force iniduals such as lawyers, politicians and lobbyists who work for foreign governments, such as Russia, to declare and register their interests. The MP for the Isle of Wight asked Mr Browder - who supports his calls for a UK Foreign Agents Registration Act - where the information about the  diplomats had come from andit was public knowledge. “It was announced by the Russians that they are in negotiation with the British Government to replace those  diplomats,” the American-born British financier revealed. Mr Seely added in response: “It sounds like there is a bit of messaging there from the Russians, isn’t it ” Two Russian nationals have been accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with Novichok last year, smearing the highly-toxic substance on the door handle of his home. Evidence gathered by intelligence agencies led the Government to conclude that the men were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU. The two suspects - known by their aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack. A counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle is thought to have contained the substance, and is what Ms Sturgess handled. She subsequently fell ill in Amesbury, Wiltshire, and died.   A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ““No new arrangements will be agreed for the  diplomats expelled from the UK as a result of Russian activity in Salisbury. “We have had a continuous dialogue with Russia about diplomatic visas since before the events in Salisbury. Visa exchanges for diplomatic staff continue within the usual constraints.” Mr Seely said after the hearing: “Bill Browder’s astonishing revelations show why Britain needs a UK Foreign Agents Registration Actlaw. “This law would force lobbyists, lawyers  PR people to detail what foreign Governments – or their proxies - they work for. “It would also entail them to detail the nature of that work. We need to tighten the law in regards to Parliamentarians – especially in the House of Lords - lobbying on behalf foreign states or doing their bidding. “People making law should not have conflict of interest.” During the hearing Mr Browder had indicated his support for the move. He said: “I think it’s an excellent idea anf frankly I’m shocked and surprised there’s no regulations demanding transparency of lobbyists”. Overall the campaigner suggested that the UK was too weak on cracking down on so-called dirty money. He told MPs: “If you’re a bad guy then London is the safest place you can be. “This is the place where property rights are most entrenched, this is the place where the rule of law is most advanced, this is the place where the courts really are independent and so as easy as they stole the money in these foreign countries, they know it’s safe here and they also have been able to come to the conclusion that nothing bad will ever happen to them. He added: “If you’re a crook from Saudi Arabia or Russia or one of these countries you can be pretty well assured that you’ll get away with your crimes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alesha macphail accused boys mum","story":"NewsAlesha MacPhail: Accused boys MUM reported him to police after six-year-olds murderThe accused boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, voluntarily spoke to officers shortly after the body of Alesha MacPhail was foundShareByPaul Rodger:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAlesha MacPhail was aged six when she died \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mother of a -year-old boy accused of abducting and murdering Alesha MacPhail contacted police after the child’s body was found, a court has heard. PC Gavin McKellar told the High Court in Glasgow, Scotland, that the teenage boy voluntarily spoke to officers at around am on July  at his home. The lad’s mum had been drinking when she phoned Rothesay police station in the early hours of the morning after Alesha’s body was discovered She told cops her son had been out of the house in the early hours of July , which was captured on CCTV. The accused was described as “confident” and “very co-operative” by PC McKellar and asked his mum to leave the room while he spoke to officers.  The court previously heard allegations from the accused that he had sex with Toni-Louise McLachlan, the girlfriend of Aleshas dad, and that she then planted the semen-filled condom as evidence to incriminate the teenager on trial.Ms McLachlan denied that that was the case.When asked by the accused’s brief how it felt to be accused of murder, Ms McLachlan said: “Horrible.“I don’t know how to take it.

A police officer, PC David Grant, recalled being called to the MacPhail household after Alesha was found to be missing.  He described the child’s gran, Angela King, as being “panicked” and blaming herself for leaving the key in the door. And he recalled being met by Alesha’s dad, Mr MacPhail, and his girlfriend, who was “very concerned and was crying.” PC Grant said Mr MacPhail appeared to be “in a daze” and was not responding fully to what he was saying, which he believed was as a result of concern for Alesha.  After the child’s body was found around am the officer was told about a kne being found on a beach opposite the MacPhail family home, near a bus shelter. A large kitchen kne with a black handle and a grey oval inset was shown to the jury on screens in the courtroom. The trial continues.

Debonair Dogs Canine Grooming Salon released a statement on the Facebook page yesterday evening, saying: As a recent video has come to light I would like to reassure all of our customers that the girl involved no longer works under our employment and has left to start her own business. I can assure you that all the Debonair Dogs team are huge animal lovers and we love nothing more than providing you and your pooches with the best care. The girl involved has been investigated as complaints have been brought to light by other members of staff which is why we had cameras put in place to seethere was any evidence to back these complaints up - which we managed to get.  But as this is a serious matter, steps needed to be taken before it could be taken any further. We really hope to continue pampering your pooches and maintaining a caring environment for them. Thanks, Debonair Dogs team. Speaking today, the manager of Debonair Dogs, who declined to give his name, confirmed the video was taken at the grooming salon. He also confirmed the woman left the salon of her own accord two weeks ago. He said: Theres a lot of people that are really upset.  The police, the RSPCA, have been involved. I dont really want to say anything until weve sorted things out with them. I can maybe say more at the end of the week. Most Facebook users who watched the clip were disgusted by the girls actions. Jayde Ann said: Omfg, I am fuming. Joanne Tebble commented: I hope shes been reported. Shouldnt be allowed near dogs. Sue Earnshaw wrote: How awful. Nasty nasty woman. Hope this is seen everywhere. Matt Sumner added: You never pick up a dog like this, its disgusting. If the dog is a nipper, its for the owners and the business to discuss and then use a muzzle. Not this. Others defended the woman, including Nicola Leanne Sayers who commented: I think she was literally just trying to get hold of the dog without getting bitten. I dont see her shaking the dog at all.

Writing on her old blog The Tig, she said: I think you need to be your own Valentine. Kensington Palace revealed Prince Harrys Valentines visit back in January. The statement read: The Duke of Sussex will meet military personnel living and training on the base, view some of the specialist outdoor severe weather equipment and training that is conducted at Clockwork and talk with expert aircrews and engineers. His trip will celebrate the th anniversary of Exercise Clockwork in Bardufoss - the traditional name of the annual winter exercise that trains Royal Marines and Royal Navy sailors and airmen. Even though it sounds like an exciting trip, it means Meghan will be spending the day without her new hubby. The couple are expecting their first child in the next few months, and Meghan has said her due date is around April. Before the baby arrives they are moving out of Kensington Palace and setting up home in Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

Brady demanded his locked briefcases be taken from his room at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside and put into storage in the hours before he died in May . Police have tried and failed to get a search warrant to go through the serial killer’s possessions. Keith’s brother Alan has said there is a ‘desperate’ need to examine the killer’s s paperwork because he took the secret of the -year-old’s final resting place on Saddleworth Moor with him to the grave. But a district judge at Manchester Magistrates’ Court turned down a police application to search them after he died of cancer because the killer and Myra Hindley are dead there is no chance of a prosecution.   Detectives had argued they only learned about them when Brady passed away - but the court defeat and further legal advice persuaded them not to go to the High Court. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said “The application [for a search warrant] was heard by a district judge on May , . Based on legal advice the force did not proceed to the High Court.” Officers also asked Robin Makin, Brady’s solicitor of  years who also controls his will, to let them inspect the briefcases and paperwork but he also refused. Brady was jailed for le in  and spent the next  years taunting his victims’ families, telling police he was ‘puzzled’ they never found Keith’s remains and in  even took officers on to the moor.   His accomplice Myra Hindley was also taken back to Saddleworth in the s when they discovered the remains of Pauline Reade - but never any trace of Keith. His brother Alan Bennett said: “There is a desperate need to look for anything that may help in the recovery of Keith’s body and there may be something in those cases. “My brother’s body still remains on the moor while all the other victims have been ed to their loved ones for a proper burial. There seems to be no compassion or thought for Keith or his family.” He added that he had correspondence with Brady while he was alive and the serial killer told him there were ‘instructions’ for him in his will. He has made a ‘personal plea’ to Mr Makin by email and letter but claims he has heard nothing.  Brady died, aged , from cancer and emphysema in Ashworth Hospital. Greater Manchester Police have said they will never close the case despite Brady’s death. Keith Bennett disappeared on the way to his grandmother’s house on June  . Hindley had lured him into her car and driven him to the Moors where he was murdered.

As one of her key areas of work this year focussing on children’s mental health, Kate discussed her own experiences with a range of professionals and academics brought together to promote mental health training in Britain’s schools. The Duchess was welcomed to the Mental Health in Education conference, hosted by The Royal Foundation, at Mercers Hall, East London, where she was praised for “all the work” she has been doing in the field of education. Kate, , was seen intently scribbling notes throughout the sessions, and then spoke with professionals about the the importance of teacher training in mental health of children.   Dressed immaculately in a Dolce  Gabbana boucle tweed skirt suit, she drew upon her own experiences and more needed to be done to help teachers and parents. She said: “When I first started out and I’ve learnt a lot in a short period of time working with organisations, I was very naive myself as a parent, of really just how important particularly the early years are for children’s futures. “And how critical it is, everyone looking after children at a critical time, teachers, parents, and everyone who’s caring for them, how important it is that we get it right. “I didn’t know what some of the issues that perhaps we take for granted here as experts know about, but it’s being able to translate it to those who don’t have the training in a way that the points come across clearly.”   Peter Fonagy CEO The Anna Freud Centre, who is a key member of Kate’s steering group on mental health, said: “We need to be involving people from the whole of the community within the school to address the issue of mental health, the address the pressure that children are under that we’ve really got to try and sort out. “I feel indeed making teachers solely responsible for that is wrong, is clearly wrong. I think it’s our shared responsibility, responsibility of community, to support the schools, to support the teachers, to support the children.” Moments before the Duchess was due to leave, she told aides she had prepared an impromptu speech before addressing the room.   Taking to the stage, Kate said: “Over the last eight years working with charities I’ve met some of our leading experts in mental health, addiction, family breakdown, homelessness and education. They have taught me over and over again that the root cause of so many of today’s social problems can be traced right back to the very earliest years of a person’s le and often over generations. “The scientic and other evidence is clear the first few years of a child’s le are more pivotal for development and for future health and happiness than any other single moment in our le time. “It is also clear that the positive development of our children is directly linked to those who care for them, teachers, carers and parents.

The teenager suffered cuts, bruises and a swollen wrist after a street attack in Brixham, Devon, on Sunday, reports Devon Live. Earlier that day, a large group of boys and girls - aged between  and  - had allegedly been hurling abuse at her.   Later, between .pm and .pm, the girls belonging to the earlier group are said to have again began shouting and swearing at Bethany as she walked from the Breakwater alone.

She claimed: I told the police  youre not going to look for the girls then I am. I was extremely angry and upset. The police attitude seems to be they just dont want to get involved, because there are issues around some of the girls. The thing that infuriates us as a community is that its the same people, they all move in the same circle.   They need find things to do that doesnt involve hurting other people. If they are bored or say they dont have anything  to do they should not take it out on other innocent kids. My children grow up in Brixham and they dont behave in that way.

Tragically, thats not the case. “In Britain today there are  species of primate that can be sold over the counter like goldfish,” says the Dorset rescue centre Monkey World, which is full and has a waiting list of  unwanted pet monkeys to take in. The monkeys it rescues from homes have numerous physical and mental problems caused by inappropriate diets and environments. “We have found the people buying monkeys to be generally well-meaning and kind, but with no education as to how dficult it would be to care for them,” said spokeswoman Charlie Crowther. As it is legal, they assume that domestication is assured.  In  more than , people signed a petition calling for tougher controls, including making anyone keeping monkeys domestically to match the standards required by zoos, but the Government decided that the current law was enough. Monkey World director Dr Alison Cronin says: “Most people dont realise that this trade still exists in Britain today and certainly wouldnt support its continued expansion and proleration with social media. The trade is getting out of control. Weve asked the Government to not even ban the trade but demand that people who are keeping these animals should be specialists, they need to know what to feed them, how to keep them, to keep them with companionship of their own kind, to provide them with appropriate veterinary care. None of these things are happening and Im continuing to collect marmoset monkeys from peoples sitting rooms living in solitary confinement in bird cages.”  Groups calling for a ban on keeping primates as pets include the animal welfare charity Four Paws, Born Free and the RSPCA, which argues: “Primates are very intelligent, social, wild animals with complicated needs that can’t be met in a home environment.” The British Veterinary Association agrees, saying: “Primates are long lived, intelligent and socially complex animals whose needs and welfare requirements are extraordinarily dficult to meet in captivity and when kept privately as pets.

Self-styled healer Simone said: “I remember Harry complaining that when he and William were with the Queen Mother, that William was always the centre of attention.   “William would be sitting next to the Queen Mother in a drawing room that dwarfed the pair of them, and Harry would be sitting at a distance from them keeping himself entertained.

Like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle today, people fawned over her outfits and were desperate to find out what the princess was wearing. And as the years went on, Dianas outfits became more and more adventurous. You may recall her iconic black form-fitting revenge dress from , which was worn on the same night the world discovered that Prince Charles had been having an affair with Camilla. However theres one other dress that Diana wore which turned heads - a slinky Dior slip dress.  The navy dress, with a lace trim, was worn by the mum-of-two to the annual Met Gala in New York in , and its now considered a key piece of fashion history. This is because it marked a change in Dianas fashion evolution, as she moved away from her conservative royal attire. But it turns out Diana almost didnt wear the dress that night - and theres an interesting reason why. According to MailOnline, Diana was worried about her sons reaction to seeing her in the gown.  She was concerned that Prince William, who was  at the time, would be embarrassed of how revealing the dress was on the then, -year-old.

Last month, Mr Khan’s we and two young sons managed to have their visas expedited so they could fulfil his dying wish. They travelled to the UK for an emotional reunion at his bedside. Now, the courageous dad, who is terminally ill, is being moved to a hospice to spend his final hours with his family. He was due to be transferred from Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, on Monday. Younger brother Faisal Han, from Sparkhill, Birmingham, has told how his family has even asked doctorsMr Khans operation could be funded privately as his health ebbs away.  Mr Khan, who had also lived in Birmingham for nine years, was refused the operation because he does not have leave to remain in the country.His brother Faisal told the Birmingham Mail : Its a very dficult time. He has not been well in the last few days and he is getting weaker and weaker, the next couple of days are going to be very, very important.The consultant says he is stable but anything can happen at any time, because his condition is irreversible. Theres no way back for him. He is being moved to the hospice in Birmingham and we dont know whats going to happen today or tomorrow. His we has not left his side, she has been at the hospital  hours, and his family will be around him. University Hospitals Birmingham is still providing the care in line with Home Office guidance that states “urgent and immediately necessary care should never be withheld or delayed.” The NHS are not chasing us for the bill, but we dont know what is going to happen, especially as my brother is not going to survive, Faisal said.   Mr Khans we Sania Butt and sons Abdullah Muhammad, , and Sa Ullah, eight, have been with him in hospital. Faisal, who visits his brother at weekends and after work, said: My brother came here for a better le, he went to London at first but I invited him to Birmingham to be with my family because he was all alone. Then he found a flat just a five minute walk from us. He had tried to work but he had overstayed his visa and he had heart problems, which meant he had collapsed several times and needed treatment. In August, he was struggling with his health and he had decided to go back to Pakistan to be with his family, he had completed all the paperwork, but then he had a cardiac arrest and he needed treatment at Heartlands Hospital. I am disappointed because we were told on the fourteenth of December that he would be considered for a transplant and they would look into placing him on the waiting list, they were saying he would be having tests and scans.   Then they said he would not be eligible because of his immigration status, because he did not have leave to remain. Doctors of the World, a humanitarian group supporting people denied access to healthcare, took up Mr Khans case, helping to secure fast-track visas for his we and sons to travel from Pakistan. In a further show of support, businessmen in Birmingham are now rallying to raise the funds for the end-of-le care and to support Mr Khan and his family. Faisal has even asked doctors whether the heart transplant could be carried out privatelythe money could be raised as a result of supported attracted through the high-profile case. I still ask themwe could arrange funding by raising money through the support we have had through the media, he said. But I have been told regardless of his immigration status he cannot have the operation because he is too weak.  The doctors have told me it would take ten or  hours and evenwe raised millions of pounds there is still no way they could perform the operation. As he is too unwell to travel back to Pakistan, he had made a fast-track application for visas allowing his we and sons to travel to his bedside. Connected to his tubes from his hospital bed, Mr Khan made a direct appeal to the British and Pakistani authorities to speed up the process, thought to have been mired in red tape. His prayers were answered and he had an emotional reunion with his family in his hospital room two weeks ago.

Liam McAtasney is accused of strangling his former high school schoolmate and throwing her body off a New Jersey, US, bridge in December . McAtasney was secretly recorded telling his friend,who was working with investigators, that he killed-year-old Sarah Stern for her inheritance. The video was filmed days beforeMcAtasney and his alleged accomplice,Preston Taylor, were charged in  with killing the -year-old girl. The defendant claims he made the story up to impress his friend. However, authorities claim McAtasney and Taylor threw Sterns body off a bridge before leaving her car there to make it look like she killed herself.   Jurors in the murder trial were were shown the video, which was caught on a hidden camera planted by police. In the footage, McAtasney tells his friend Anthony Curry: I pretty much hung her. I picked her up and had her dangling off the ground. It took me a half hour to kill her. I set a timer. McAtasney says in the video he then shoved a shirt down her throat and placed his finger on her nose. He casually said Sterns dog just laid there and watched as I killed her.   The video reveals McAtasney apparently tried to enlist Taylors help dumping Sterns body off the Route  bridge because he didnt realise how heavy she would be. The accused also says he hoped he would land , by robbing Sterns inheritance after killing her, but that he only got ,.

But according to a womens heath expert, we should all be focusing on something much more important than roses, date nights and sexy underwear this year. Stephanie Taylor, managing director ofKegel, is trying to get women looking after their own intimate areas. She says: Every woman dreams of being treated like a goddess on Valentines Day. Yet, many of us are guilty of not looking after number one…our vaginas. The happiness and health of your intimate body parts should be high up on your list of priorities all year around, just like looking after your skin, hair and nails.   To help woman look after their vaginas, Stephanie has shared a list of  tips she claims every woman should follow. . Save, dont shave While some women may feel cleaner, more comfortable or even sexier when they shave, pubic hair does serve a purpose.It protects from bacteria and infections such asFolliculitis, absorbs sweat and acts as a buffer against friction. A recent survey found  per cent of woman shave down there, and  per cent getting rid of everything - so this is something lots of people need to focus on. . Stay balanced You might not know it, but vaginas are actually self-cleaning thanks to good bacteria known asLactobacilli. Using perfumed shower gels, bubble baths, moisturisers and wipes can upset your carefully balanced pH levels, potentially leaving you withuncomfortablethrushorbacterial vaginosis. So, next time you’re in the supermarket, opt for a perfume-free or sensitive products.   . Brief encounters Stephanies next tip involved that cheeky underwear set youve bought for your other half... Sexy underwear and Valentine’s Day go hand in hand but the last thing you want is your fun ruined by a Urinary Tract Infection. When it comes to pelvic health, some underwear is better for you than others. Typically, thongs are tight-fitting and sit close to the skin, moving back and forth throughout the day which can contribute to a UTI. No matter what underwear you prefer, always opt for cotton, which is the most breathable fabric, helping to keep moisture at bay. . Hello hydration We all know drinking lots of water is important, but did you know its vital for a healthy vagina  Stephanie explains: Hitting the daily recommended HO level can be a struggle, butthe promise of glowing skin and more energy doesnt incentivise you, maybe your vagina might.  If youre dehydrated, the drier youll be down there, which could lead to issues like an infection, itching or burning. Depending on how active you are, you should aim to drink between two and three litres of water a day.If the thought of tap water bores you, jazz it up with citrus fruits, cucumber and mint. . The Golden Rule Stephanie has one Golden Rule when it comes to keeping things happy down there. She says: While there are many sex myths, you should believe this one…peeing after sex. That’s because clearing your bladder instantly flushes out any bacteria in your vagina and urinary tract, cutting your risk of getting a UTI. You may not feel the sensation to go immediately after, but dont worry, as long as its done within a reasonable amount of time you can relax. . Change after the gym According to Stephanie, staying in your gym clothes after your work out is a sin.   She says: The thought of brunch after a sweaty workout might be a great motivator but staying in your gym clothes for too long is a sin. Sweaty clothes and underwear create the perfect breeding ground for bad bacteria, particularlythey’re tight and made from latex or polyester. So, have a quick shower and put on fresh clothes before you get on with the rest of your day. . Work your pelvic floor Pelvic floor weakness is often thought of as an old woman problem but the truth is it can affect any woman at any point in her le. If you ignore your pelvic floor, you could end up with bladder incontinence, prolapse or a loss of sensation during sex.  Pelvic floor exercises should be part of your daily routine andyou need an extra helping hand, try a pelvic toner which uses electrical impulses to stimulate those all-important muscles. . Get to know your flow Stephanies final tip is an important one, and its all about your periods.She says: Periods arent always predictable. If you often find yourself caught short or waiting and waiting, download a fertility tracking app to help you keep tabs on your cycle. When your flow does start itll be at its heaviest for the first day or two.Make sure to change your pad frequentlyand opt for a thicker night-time towel. If you prefer tampons, always use the smallest size you can and never leave one in longer than eight hours to avoid putting yourself at risk ofToxic Shock Syndrome .

Birth photographer Jana Brasil captured the baby completely surrounded by the amniotic fluid which had protected it during the pregnancy. Noahs whole body is engulfed by the sac but he still wiggles and attempts to cry as he is pulled from his mothers body. The sac usually splits just before birth and is more commonly known as a womans waters breaking. His -year-old mother told reporters at the Praia da Costa Hospital in the city of Vila Velha: People all around the world are reposting the photos and looking for us. I saw him being born. They lowered the screen so I could see. I cried a lot. Its an emotion that has no size.

Last year I took photos of babies in the sacs, I have two awards. But nothing like the photo of Noah, it surprised me.

Being on the pitch it certainly felt it could have been a lot more than - at the break.“We dominated the game and that gives you a bit of confidence, especially playing against a Premiership team.“Second half we knew St Mirren were going to come out and have a bit more about them.“They did, but we were dealing with it without any real problems.“Unfortunately for us, Calum Butcher got sent off when it was a - tackle in midfield and could have just been a yellow card.“But he got sent off and then we showed the character to stick in and win the game.“We were playing against a team from the level above us for about  minutes with  men.

They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is.

arrived","story":"Almost four months into his reign as Dundee manager, Jim McIntyre won’t look back on his first match in charge with too much fondness.However, he might just do so with a great deal more satisfaction with how his squad has shaped up in the time since.Despite only picking up two wins and six draws in the  matches under McIntyre, there’s a growing sense of optimism at Dens Park after some encouraging displays since the January transfer window.The opposite can be said of Saturday’s opponents Livingston, the side the Dark Blues faced in Jim’s debut in the dugout.After a lightning-fast start to theirto the Premiership – which peaked with that - thumping of Dundee back in October – Livi’s form has slipped off a clf with last Wednesday’s - draw at Hearts bringing a five-game losing streak to an end.Since leaving Dundee gaffer Jim in no doubt how big a job he had on his hands with that - success at the Tony Macaroni Arena, Gary Holt’s side have only picked up three victories and none since the middle of December.That’s seen them slip from a high of second spot with  points from their first eight games down to ninth with just  picked up from the following  matches.And, though the gap between the sides hasn’t shrunk in those four months, the feeling around both clubs right now couldn’t be more dferent.A massive part of that from Dundee’s point of view is the complete overhaul of the playing squad in the winter transfer window.In fact, there’s a fair chance there won’t be any of the players who featured in the - defeat the last time the Dark Blues travelled to West Lothian this time around.Only three of the  used by Jim that day remain at the club – Elliott Parish, Cammy Kerr and Kenny Miller.Of those, only Miller looks like he could be given a start this time around but even he has a fair bit of competition to overcome with Andrew Nelson on the goal trail and Craig Curran preferred by the manager to lead the line in every match since he arrived at the club at the start of January.A missed penalty in stoppage time in their last run-out won’t have helped veteran Miller’s cause either.Meanwhile, Parish hasn’t featured since that - thumping and doesn’t look like dislodging Seny Dieng as first choice any time soon.The nature of the goals that day, with all four from set-pieces, no doubt led the manager to question his defenders.Parish quickly paid the price by dropping to the bench while three of the back four have been moved on.Andy Boyle is now at Ross County, Ryan Inniss was sent back to Crystal Palace after a nightmare at Palmerston in the Scottish Cup and Calvin Miller has also dropped to the Championship, being picked up by Ayr United on loan from Celtic.Kerr was right-back in October but he’s seen his place taken by new signing James Horsfield in recent games.The former Manchester City kid has looked assured in Kerr’s place and will take some shting before Saturday.The rest of the team have since been shown the exit door – Glen Kamara, Kharl Madianga, Lewis Spence, Sofien Moussa, Benjy Kallman, Roarie Deacon and Adil Nabi have all moved on.Even the side that drew - with Livi at Dens on Boxing Day will be unrecognisable to the one running out this weekend.Whatever side he opts for, Jim knows his team are in a far better place than when he took over – now they have to prove that by getting points on the board."},{"url":null,"title":"man denies pushing and kicking another man in dundee pub","story":"John Campbell, , of Midmar Place, will stand trial on March .He denies one charge of

to park for free for  minutes to be extended to half-an-hour.And they are being backed by city councillor and depute Inverness Provost Bet McAllister.The scheme was introduced last year following a campaign by the Inverness Courier and Inverness Business Improvement District and its up for review this month.Local traders said they would like to see the time limit extended so they can conduct more business.It was introduced to help improve the footfall in shops in the city centre which have been adversely affected by out-of-town retail parks.But Mr Finnie has opposed the scheme from the

ldquoAir pollution is the cause in thousands of deaths each year, and exacerbates many serious medical conditions.ldquoPlans to extend free parking in the city centre are ill-informed and increase the risk of air pollution related illness and death.ldquoWe need to encourage people to leave their cars at home and use buses or walk and cycle in and around Inverness. Increasing the number of cars in the city simply frustrates these efforts. More congestion means buses are less likely to run on time, for instance.He added: ldquoResearch shows that investing in cycling can signicantly improve shop occupancy and town centre spend.

Exodus, the third game in the series inspired by Dmitry Glukhovsky#strilogy, takes Artyom out of the from the tunnels he calls home and out to discover what happened to the rest of the world outside of the Russian capital.With small band of Spartans,Exodus will take you on-board the Aurora as you seek to explore what#s happened to the rest of your country following the nuclear war that devastated the world  years earlier.No corner of the country you explore is untouched by the devastation of the war, with small bands of civilians struggling to make a le in the countryside controlled by mutated creatures, disfigured monsters and violent bandits holding up in the ruins of Civilization.So it#s time to dust off your gas mask, grab your geiger counter and head back into post-apocalyptic wildlands # and as the Russians say, Удачи.  Exodus moves away from the claustrophobic, cramped confines of Moscow#s underground and instead takes you out in the wilds of post-apocalypic Russia.The Aurora # an armoured steam train # serves as your semi-mobile base as you move through the countryside battling to survive. Every stop of the train not only helps progress the story, but also acts as a central hub for exploration of the inidual zones you come across.These large zones feel much bigger than anything previously seen in agame, the well-crafted, well-designed environments are dferent and enticing, populated with a mix of radioactive mutants, ferocious wildle, unforgiving radiation zones, crazy civilians and vicious bandits. Players are able # and actively encouraged # to explore the zones in depth with smaller optional side quests giving an added reason to explore the far corners of the map.Hidden throughout each of the zones are small secure bases which act as a home away from the train, with workbench for crafting and bed to progress the day night cycle which can change the flow of a mission.As you progress through the game, set over the course of an entire calendar year, the seasons and environments change, moving from winter to spring and beyond, with the dynamic weather adding an extra challenge as you battle through blizzards, thunderstorms and mist.Other locations in the wilderness include small villages, bandit camps and ruined bunkers full of Humanimals and other beasts. Whether you choose to attack these at day or night can have a fundamental affect in the way you approach them. Typically there#s more mutants around at night, but you have the added benefit of being able to hide in the shadow#s easier.The design ofExodus means there#s a real choice between taking an area by stealth, slowly but methodically taking out enemies quietly on your way, or going loud with gunfire and grenades to clear an encampment. Not only will the potential outcome change, with rescuing certain hostages allowing earlier access to some items, but your decisions are reflected in the games dialogue. vw, px\"  Evenyou do opt for a full all-out assault on a base, the designers have created the structures in such a way you can skulk in the shadows to plan your move. Regardless of how you approach it, exploration is key to providing vital crafting components to improve your guns, construct ammo and replenish your stocks of medkits.And while the radiation and toxic air is, for the most part gone, there#s still areas where the iconicgas mask is needed # and keeping it in good nick and stocked with filters is vital for those moments.It#s this crafting element that really allows you to personalise your experience ofExodus. Each weapon has countless dferent possible iations, with the ability to mody pretty much every every aspect of your gun and armour to suit your own play style.Crafting and exploration is key toExodus, here#s a few a spoiler-free tips from us. vw, px\"   Exodus builds upon the success of andLast Light, incorporating the key features while bringing a whole new element in the non-linear open world sections.The balance between making the game feel new and fresh, and very clearly still agame and continuing Artyom#s story is very well done. The five years A games spent making it have been very well used.The level design, use of day night cycles and weather has resulted in a very attractive game with clear elements designed to encourage exploration, but never shoe-horning you into a specic play style. vw, px\"  That great level design is accompanied by fantastic immersive audio which is never more apparent while your sneaking your way through the sewers dodging mutants, and staying out of flicking candlelight while you sneak up on a vigilant guard.For fans of the series this is going to be a must pick up follow-up when it launches later this week, for those new to the series i#m going to recommend picking up the remastered double pack first to familiarise yourself with the story. Saying that, gamers who love the horror action combo are going to be a big fan of the very brilliantExodus.Our review is based on the console version ofExodus played on an Xbox One X."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/AR-1-940x529.jpg ","title":"app brings charlie to life","story":"An innovative Aberdeen children’s charity has joined forces with an Aberdeen-based company to bring its beloved mascot to le.Charlie House, which supports children and babies with complex disabilities or le-limiting conditions in the north-east, has launched a new Augmented Realityapp.The charity teamed up with PWK Sales  Marketing, the firm behind the mobile application ROAR, which acts as a tool for businesses and organisations and allows them to bring video content to the screen.Supporters of the charity can download it for free and use it to scan a picture of Charlie Dog in his Big Build outfit, as well as the charity’s logo which can be found on any of their leaflets. vw, px\"   vw, px\"  When scanned, it will bring up videos and information about its Big Build appeal, which launched in November.The appeal is fundraising to build an eight-bedroom specialist support centre set in four acres of ground at Woodend Hospital.Paul Caruana, director at PWK Sales and Marketing, said: “We are absolutely delighted to be supporting Charlie House in any way we can.“Their desire to engage supporters is fantastic.“Charlie House’s AR campaigns are a fantastic example of how it can be used to raise an organisation’s profile and achieve their goals.”It is hoped the movies will help people learn more about the campaign and encourage them to dig deep and donate towards the charity’s vision.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising at Charlie House, said: “As a charity we are always looking for fun and innovative ways to bring home the Charlie House message and keep people updated in regard to our services and progress with our Big Build appeal.“We are very grateful to PWK for their support with this latest technology, which gives people the opportunity to find out more about us as and when they wish, and also the chance to donate at the click of a button.“We look forward to sharing more exclusive video content via the app shortly.”The new centre, which will be the first of its kind in the north-east, will support a range of facilities such as a sensory room, library, spa pool, craft room, teen den, soft play area, therapy room, star room for end-of-le care and bereavement and sensory gardens.Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local charlie-house-launches--million-appeal-to-build-specialist-care-centre-for-north-east-children embed # secretiOPqSVv\" data-secret\"iOPqSVv\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children# # Evening Express\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

The leave will support employees to attend medical appointments and counselling, attend legal proceedings, seek safe housing and visit support agencies. Ms Brennan-Whitefield, SNP member for Ayr North, said South Ayrshire was setting an example by implementing the policy. She told the Ayrshire Post : Domestic abuse can affect anyone at any time - it affects both men and women so this in inclusive regardless of gender or sexual orientation.I think that it was unanimously agreed at full council shows that this issue is now on peoples’ radar. Hazel Bingham, manager of South Ayrshire Womens Aid, added: South Ayrshire Councils decision is a massive step in the right direction for people living with domestic abuse and will, I have no doubt, make a long lasting dference for people at a time when they need help most.

a short term conditional agreement, for a secure and exclusive interest, that can be exercised for a full lease once all necessary consents # including planning permission and the marine licence have been secured.With the planned expansion, by an increase of  per cent, of the two existing MOWI sites, at Carradale and a third site at Cour Point, Kilbrannan Sound will be home to the single largest concentration of fish farm pens and salmon biomass in Europe.The SGA believe sea lice outbreaks from salmon farms contribute to the collapse of wild salmon stocks.A spokesperson said: #While a healthy salmon can survive with a burden of sealice, the high number of lice found in captive areas can lead to weakness and death.#Does Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Government acknowledge both the impact of sea lice and the subsequent use of chemicals, presently being felt in the Kilbrannan Sound An impact not only on wild salmon and sea trout stocks also our very localised lobster, crab

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it.

bright yellow bus was not in keeping with the historic site and a lack of detail about how the venture would operate.But the council planning officerrsquos report noted: ldquoThe proposed bus for use as a noodle bar would be positioned on the site such that by virtue of the positioning and orientation of the windows and doors on it would not give rise to any harmful overlooking of any nearby

states that permission has been given for two years, although this could be extended.The historic auction mart was traditionally a bustling agricultural centre for East Linton.However, in recent years it has been transformed and become home to The Mart Farm Shop and Cafe and also Viarama, which is Scotlandrsquos first virtual reality company and social enterprise.In addition, regular farmersrsquo

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-shetland-is-back-and-grislier-than-ever","story":"****COME off it, DI Jimmy Perez.

I really wanted to do something with the song, so we used it in the trailer.ldquoThen after a while I started thinking the same kind of thoughts we had when we were making Whatever Gets You Through The Night, and that it would be a really interesting way to broaden out the festival beyond astronomy and star-gazing.

A lot of the stories people were coming up with when we were first making that project were about endurance and survival. So it seemed like an interesting thing to explore in this context.The festival, which runs until  February , includes photography exhibitions, film screenings, expert discussion on the cosmos and insight into the inidual benefit of sensory enlightenment through exposure to the dark, with indoor and outdoor venues including the former RAF radar station at Gallan Head, the UKrsquos most north-westerly point.Glasgow-based singer songwriter Emma Pollock said the festivalrsquos appeal lay in its celebration of the winter experience.ldquoItrsquos so dferent to that of the summer on the island or the winter on the mainland, and I think for that reason itrsquos beautul idea, because so many of us just donrsquot get to experience that emptiness or that silence, said the former lead singer of Lanarkshire indie band The Delgados.ldquoThis is essentially a nod to the fact that the contrast between night and day in a rural community is much greater than you ever get living in the city.Ms Pollock will perform her song Dark Skies as part of her performance at An Lanntair, written for the  project as a reflection on growing up in Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway close to the Galloway Forest, one of two Dark Skies Parks in Scotland - the other being in the Cairngorm National Park.She said: ldquoI was thrown back to where I grew up, that emptiness, that rural space which is so much more magnied at night and is such a huge contrast with urban darkness.ldquoIf yoursquore out there and the weather is good, then what you can see is quite incredible.

The Government at UK level should take that prospect off the table, it should rule out no-deal and its failure to do so with every day that passes right now becomes increasingly reckless and negligent.But, she explained, such a prospect did put a responsibility on the Scottish Government to increase its planning.ldquoWe stepped up the level of our planning today, the FM revealed.ldquoWe canrsquot mitigate all impacts of that, the impacts will be so wide-ranging and so severe that it will not be possible to take away all of that impact but itrsquos important that within our areas of responsibility wersquore doing everything that we possibly can and wersquore very focused on exactly that.Asked what advice she would be giving to Scottish householders, Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoThe Scottish Government over the next few weeks will run public information campaigns.ldquoWersquoll look to give not just advice to households but we will give advice, we already give advice to businesses and to all sectors of the economy.ldquoOf course therersquos a balance we need to strike. We donrsquot want to unnecessarily worry and scare people but with every day that passes itrsquos more important that the implications are understood and that the Scottish Government working with our partners, local government, the business community and others, that we take all possible steps.When it was put to her that Theresa May did not have the power to take no-deal off the table and she might have to ask the EU for an extension to the Article  process, which they could refuse, the SNP leader replied: ldquoOkay, I accept that point but she should request it and the SNP amendment that will be tabled for tomorrow makes that call on the UK Government to request an extension.ldquoIt is based on what I hear from Europe. It is unlikely that that would be turned down by the European Union of course, it is more likely to be acceptedthat request comes with a clear plan to take a dferent approach.ldquoItrsquos not going to help in the medium to long terman extension is simply to continue this unseemly argument that the House of Commons is engaged in right now because they canrsquot agree what they want to do, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-valentines-day-commons-humiliation-as-tory-brexiteers-poised-to-defeat-government-motion","story":"Such a move would further hamper the Prime Ministerrsquos efforts to get the EU to agree a revised deal as the clock runs down to exit day on March .As MPs prepared for the latest Commons showdown, Nicola Sturgeon hit out at the ldquofrankly incredible consequences of a no-deal outcome, including shortages of food and medicine.In an interview with ITVrsquos Peston programme, following a meeting of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Resilience Committee, the First Minister insisted a no-deal Brexit was not inevitable.ldquoThe Government at UK level should take that prospect off the table, it should rule out no-deal and its failure to do so with every day that passes right now becomes increasingly reckless and negligent, she declared.In the second next-steps Commons debate and vote today, the Government has put forward a seemingly innocuous motion, reiterating Parliamentrsquos support for the ldquoapproach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on January .:Brexit: Theresa May accused of showing contempt for democracyLast monthrsquos votes not only saw an amendment passed that called for the backstop to be replaced by ldquoalternative arrangements, which the Government championed, but also one rejecting the UK leaving the EU without a deal.On Tuesday night, Olly Robbins, the UKrsquos chief Brexit official, was reportedly overheard in a Brussels bar, saying Mrs Mayrsquos strategy was to offer a last-minute Commons vote in March for either her revised deal or a y delay to Brexit.During PMQs, she brushed aside the claim, saying people should not rely ldquoon what someone said to someone  as overheard by someone  in a bar, again emphasising the Article  timescale ran out on March .No  sought to disabuse people of the notion Mrs May was surreptitiously ruling out a no-deal outcome.Her spokesman declared: ldquoIf yoursquore asking me a question: does no-deal remain on the table  The answer is yes.But members of the Conservativesrsquo anti-EU European Research Council made clear they could not support the ldquoclumsily-worded Government motion.Mark Francois, its vice-chairman, said: ldquoWe cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no-deal and removes our negotiating leverage in BrusselshellipIt is madness.Several amendments have been tabled. John Bercow, the Speaker, will decide which ones will be debated and voted on this evening.Labour has tabled a proposal, which would require the Government to either put its deal to a vote by February  or allow Parliament to take control of the process.Its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer - who on Wednesday had \"frank and serious\" talks with David Lidington, the PMrsquos de facto deputy - said Labour was committed to preventing Mrs May from pursuing a \"reckless\" policy of running down the clock so MPs were faced with a choice between her deal or no-deal with just days to go to exit day.The SNP tabled an amendment requiring the UK Government to begin immediate negotiations with the European Council to extend Article  by no less than three months.:Ian Blackford accuses Theresa May of rewriting the history books over BrexitIan Blackford, the party leader at Westminster, said: ldquoThe UK Government must stop running down the clock and put the brakes on Brexit before we are dragged off the clf-edge with catastrophic damage to jobs, living standards and the economy.Other amendments include one tabled by Ken Clarke, the former Tory Chancellor, calling for votes on ious Brexit options and one from the SNPrsquos Angus MacNeil to scrap the Article  process altogether.While todayrsquos vote will be an important indicator of Parliamentrsquos mood, any successful amendment will not be legally binding on the Government.In contrast, a promised next-steps vote on February  is being described as ldquoHigh Noon as it is when a new amendment, drawn up by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper, will be tabled, stipulatingthere were no deal by mid-March, MPs would either vote to agree a no-deal Brexit or to require the PM to seek an extension of Article .A similar move was defeated in January but the new version appears to be gaining more support and could even be backed by Cabinet ministers, who would resign to do so.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Thursday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

But after holding the first AGM last week, the group now wants to go after larger projects through the lottery funding.The ultimate ambition is to renovate Dingwall Town Hall and ensure it is brought into regular and sustained use by locals and visitors as a focal point of the town.Before that, the DCDC directors and trustees, comprising Janet Bowen, Debbie Downie, Robin Lingard and Nigel Greenwood have been ldquosting through the communityrsquos suggestions for improvements to the town.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoDingwall is very fortunate to have a number of organisations which are dedicated to making the town an attractive and welcoming place. But we want to use our charitable status to unlock funding for capital projects which should make a signicant dference in raising Dingwallrsquos profile.The first of those projects out of the traps has been developed with the help of the Dingwall History Society and is a heritage trail around the town which stops off at around a dozen sites.Among them are the memorial next to the train station, the birthplace of MacBeth ndash Dingwall Castle, as well as the Macdonald Monument and others.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoUsing a series of display  to highlight to both local people and visitors the richness of Dingwallrsquos history, especially as a Viking settlement.A sticking point however is that the bridge over the Dingwall canal is closed due to safety concerns.ldquoThe big issue here, of course, is the future of the footbridge across the Dingwall canal, which has been out of use for some time now because of safety fears. The community council is very anxious to bring it back into use and we are looking at what role we might play in helping to bring it back into use.Many local groups feel that Dingwallrsquos Viking heritage has been a little neglected but in  archaeologists and historians managed to flesh out the legends.

It is remarkable the teachers are able to care for and teach the pupils in such a damp, cramped building.ldquoThere is a desperate need for a new building, delivered in consultation with parents and teachers. This is, of course, a matter for Highland Council who are statutorily responsible for school buildings but I think everybody wants to see a solution.\"I am more than happy to work with anybody and everybody to find a solution and would sincerely hope that wersquore not still talking about school buildings in another  years.\"Childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd, also a Ross-shire-based SNP MSP, said: \"The school has not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans despite being in a poor condition.\"Itrsquos nearly a year since I first raised concerns with the council so I look forward to meeting with councillors and officers at the end of this month to hear an update on progress. All children, especially those who are disadvantaged and vulnerable, deserve our help to enable them to, not only fulfil, but to exceed their potential. That is why it is vital that we can find the right solution for the pupils, parents and the wider St Clementrsquos community.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"At this point in time we are addressing our capital plan for next year and the process is still ongoing.

The latest conflict within the Conservative Party follows reports that the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on Europe, civil servant Olly Robbins, was overheard in a Brussels bar saying MPs would eventually be given the choice between accepting Mrs May’s deal or a signicant delay to Brexit.Mr Robbins, who has become a target for attacks by Tory MPs, was also reported to have said the controversial “backstop” provision to prevent a hard border in Ireland would become a “bridge” to the future relationship with the EU, signalling close adherence to Brussels rules.At Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told Mrs May she had been “rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser”.There were howls of anger from Eurosceptics over Mr Robbins’s reported comments, with former Ukip leader Nigel Farage calling for him to be sacked for “treachery and incompetence”. But Mrs May dismissed the issue as “what someone said to someone , as overheard by someone , in a bar”.And Conservative vice-chairman Chris Philp said: “What a civil servant might speculate in a bar after a few drinks is frankly not that important.”Downing Street denied the backstop would serve as a bridge, insisting it was “an insurance policy that is never intended to be used”.Speaking to the BBC ahead of today’s vote on the government’s “neutral” motion, ERG vice-chairman Mark Francois said: “We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels.“The Prime Minister,she went through the lobbies for this tomorrow night, would be voting against the guarantees she has given in the Commons for months. It is madness.”Mrs May’s official spokesman said: “What the motion reflects is the position the Prime Minister set out after those votes, which is the Parliament wants the UK to leave with a deal, but in order to do so it requires us to secure legally-binding changes in relation to the backstop.”He added: “No deal is an eventuality we wish to avoid, but one we continue to plan for. Does no deal remain on the table  The answer is yes.”Labour has tabled an amendment for debate in the Commons today that would require the Prime Minister to either put her deal to a vote by  February or allow Parliament to take control of the process.Veteran Tory Europhile Kenneth Clarke has tabled a further amendment, backed by senior figures from across the House, including Labour’s Harriet Harman, which would allow MPs to vote for their preferred Brexit outcome. His plan envisages MPs ranking options in order of preference on a ballot paper.An amendment from Labour MP Roger Godsf calls for an extension of the two-year Brexit negotiation period to allow for a second referendum.Another tabled by the SNP’s Angus MacNeil calls on Mrs May simply to revoke the Article  letter informing the EU of Britain’s intention to leave.Meanwhile, a cross-party initiative backed by Tory Anna Soubry and Labour’s Chuka Umunna demands the government publish its most recent official briefing on the implications of a no-deal Brexit for business and trade.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BROADFORD-PIER-HOUSE-H-FRASER-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project.

It said it represented an increase of p per week for the average household and an average increase of £. per week for businesses.Deputy mayor Cheryl Johnston said: \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Councils approach is always to strike a fair balance between keeping rates as low as possible, with securing existing and attracting new jobs, boosting inward investment and promoting tourism and other key priorities across the borough.\"This is in addition to money council has also already secured for the next  years, at no additional unplanned cost to the ratepayer. \"This includes work on St Patricks Barracks development, The Gobbins phase two, Carrickfergus town centre regeneration, and rollout of broadband services in Carrickfergus and Ballymena.\"Derek McCallan, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, said the overall picture from the council rates was one of \"growth and prudence\".\"Growth, in that councils are investing in high quality services from leisure provision to sustainable job creation, plus all of their regulatory and statutory services like environmental health and planning,\" he added.But he warned the Stormont regional rate could be twice as much as the council average. Mr McCallan said the relatively modest increase was in spite of tens of millions being added to employment costs over the next year. He said this was due to national pay agreements on the National Living Wage and new costs associated with increased powers transferred to councils from government departments.\"It is good that councils are combining growth and efficiency, keeping high-quality services, ambition and affordable costs in equal measure,\" he said.He added that the \"wider decision-taking vacuum\" caused by the Stormont impasse made it dficult for councils to plan properly for the future.\"Councils and taxpayers dont yet know what the Stormont regional rate will be, although it is estimated to be over % - double the average council rate and over twice the rate of inflation,\" he added. \"Frankly, unless the councils are given more resources to deal with an increasing set of expectations, they will be forced to make even more service cuts rather than expect local ratepayers to pay for services which should be supported by the rest of government.\"Belfast City Council, the largest, increased rates by .%.This means domestic ratepayers are paying an average extra p per month, with offices and retail paying an extra £. per month. Ulster Unionist councillor Peter Johnston, who chairs the strategic policy and resources committee at City Hall, said the increase had been kept to a minimum and would be accompanied by the £m City Deal for the region.Alliance had favoured a .% rise, claiming that £, for bonfire ersionary schemes - funding which has been criticised for a lack of transparency - was hiking rates higher than necessary.The biggest increase of .%, set by Derry and Strabane District Council, will see bills rise by around £. per month for householders. The council said the increase represents investment in new services, initiatives and strategic projects linked to a prospective City Deal.Earlier this month the councils lead finance officer Alfie Dallas said there had also been a \"signicant challenge\" with statutory pressures, such as nationally agreed pay awards, pay alignment and pension increases. The \"most challenging and disappointing\" aspect, he said, had been central Government grant cuts.\"The council has lost out on £, of rates support grant since cuts commenced in  , income which could have delivered a further minimum £m of capital investment or investment in other strategic priorities identied in our strategic inclusive growth plan,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"exhibition couples who found true love at orange hall dances","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Temporary suspension orders were granted against nine of the  nurses.Seven of these nurses appealed the suspension and were successful after the High Court ruled there was insufficient evidence to impose an interim suspension order.The NMC subsequently said it must be allowed to access controversial CCTV footage, which is alleged to show scenes of shocking abuse, in order to carry out is regulatory duties.

Last night detective chief inspector Jill Duffie said: \"The CCTV footage captured in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment of patients at Muckamore Abbey Hospital is crucial evidence within the ongoing police criminal investigation. \"The handling, viewing and distribution of that evidence for purposes other than the criminal case therefore has to be carefully considered for fear of prejudicing or damaging any future criminal trial.\"The ongoing safeguarding enquiries and staff disciplinary procedures initiated by Belfast Trust and other professional bodies are separate and independent of the PSNI investigation. \"We recognise however the importance of those processes and have been working very closely with our partner agencies to try, as best as possible, to allow those disciplinary processes to progress alongside the police investigation.\"She said police have offered a number of solutions on how the Belfast Trust could provide the necessary information to the NMC regarding the allegations.She added that the NMC is currently identying the specic information which it requires.Speaking after an all-party meeting with the Belfast Trust, Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan said the handling of nurses accused of wrong-doing demonstrated the need for a full public inquiry."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland house price rise highest in uk belfast has 7","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Age UK found over % of people aged  and over in the UK - equivalent to over two million people - would not be able to afford a TV licence or would have to cut back to pay for it.In Northern Ireland, having to pay the fee would push  older people below the poverty line, Age NI said.Eithne Gilligan, head of policy and engagement at the charity, added: \"Removing or limiting the concession would have a major impact on the lives of some of our oldest citizens.\"Its an outrage that even one older person should risk falling into poverty, let alone the most vulnerable who are living with some combination of low income, disability and loneliness. \"The Government created this problem and it is in their power to solve it.\"We urge them to stop hiding behind the BBC and accept responsibility for free TV licences for the over-s.\"Age NI previously called on the Government to urgently take back responsibility for the funding and administration of the free TV licences policy.It said that over-s were more likely than younger people to live alone.This, combined with high levels of ill health and disability, can make them isolated and dependent on TV for companionship and news, the charity said.A survey by Age NI heard evidence of how important TV was to older people.It found more than a thirdof people aged  and over agreed that TV was their main form of company. Older people spoke of the importance of TV to their wellbeing and described it as a leline.Yesterday, Mrs May said taxpayers wanted to see the BBC use its \"substantial\" licence fee income in an \"appropriate way\" to deliver fully for audiences. Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions, Labour MP Rosie Cooper said: \"Despite her partys manesto promise, nearly , pensioner households in my West Lancashire constituency could lose their free TV licences - often thats their only source of company.\"Is the Government going to keep their manesto promise by taking back the responsibility theyve outsourced to the BBC to ensure that older people keep their TV licences \"Mrs May replied: \"I recognise the value that people across the country place on having a television and for many elderly people the connection that brings with the world - and thats why the free licences for the over-s are so important.\"We want and expect the BBC to continue free licences when they take over responsibility for the concession in .\"I think taxpayers rightly want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers fully for UK audiences.\"The BBC said: \"Free TV licences for people over  are expected to cost £m a year by  , and government funding for the scheme ends in June .\"Were conscious that pensioner poverty is still an issue for some older people. We set out a range of options in our consultation - each with merits and consequences, and implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people.\"We invited a range of views to help the BBC make the best and fairest decision and the consultation is now closed.\"We will carefully consider all the responses, and the BBC expects to make a decision by June this year.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37814634.ece/a1046/AUTOCROP/w620/RAF_flypast_.jpg","title":"watch raf tornado jet buzzes tower in northern ireland finale flypast before retirement","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/ource srcset=/resources/images/5765954.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Many working class loyalist communities have the lowest levels of registration yet are amongst the staunchest unionists. Republican talk of a border poll is a good reminder of the need to register to actually make their voice heard,” he said. “I don’t envisage a border poll in my political letime but it is always best to be prepared.

The answer to this all depends on whether we leave the EU with or without a deal and when you want to travel.Pet passports wont be valid with a no deal BrexitAt the minute, you are supposed to have a pet passport for your dogtheyrsquore travelling from the UK to the EU and vice versa, although it is my understanding that there are no checks on pets crossing the Republic or Ireland and Northern Ireland border at the minute. Pet passports list the dferent treatments your pet has had and ensures they are microchipped and up to date with their rabies vaccine.Read more: JD Wetherspoon favours more UK products as Brexit moves closerThe passport means your pooch wont have to go into quarantine on arrival.If the UK leaves without a deal, then the rules will change and pet passports issued in the UK would no longer be valid.In this case, pet owners would need to get a health certicate - and the bad news is, this will take at least four months. Your dog will need a rabies vaccine with blood samplestaken  days after the jab. You will then have to wait three months after the samples come back clear to get the health certicate.The best thing to do is contact your vet for the latest advice four months before you hope to travel.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Police probe poisoning of two birds Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingStorm Erik worse than originally thought - Met Office extend warning as mph gales pummel N.I.Derry Girls series two trailer releasedNorthern Ireland: The market value of all  players in Michael ONeills pound.m squad          ..

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Penarth Pier Pavilion is open for youngsters on Pancake Tuesday, March  for a special pancake event with support from the Waterloo Tea Rooms, while the Italian Cultural Centre Wales will be teaching children about Italian carnival traditions.There will be plenty of music to accompany the feasting, with -man strong Welsh festival band Wonderbrass playing ious events across the town over the festival, finishing with a full band performance on March . Wonderbrass are known for their electric blend of New Orleans jazz, ska, and blues with contemporary hip-hop and funk updates.Those preferring their music a touch more traditional may prefer to sing with the Male Welsh Voice Choir, or the Criw Canu womenrsquos singing group. Both organisations will be holding open practice sessions ahead of time.Colourful carnival ribbon produced in Pembrokeshire will also be available for decorations and discounts. Perfect for colourful bunting, and many shops say festival-goers wearing the fabric will be in for special offers and discounts.The festival will open with long-distance cyclist Dave Hann.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Brexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate.

Last year’s team were denied the opportunity as the National Final did not take place. This year the event will be held at Stormont and teams from England and Wales will travel to contest the trophies.The local team consists of Joanna Kerr acting as Chairperson, Joshua Quinn, the Speaker and Danielle Weir, Expresser of Thanks.Joanna won Best Chairperson, while Danielle was awarded Best Expresser of Thanks. For Joshua, he was encouraged by an adjudicator’s commendation when informed that the adjudicating team had been split over Best Speaker.The competition takes the format of a meeting in miniature.The role of the Chairperson is to welcome everyone, put them at their ease, introduce the Speaker and manage the proceedings.The speaker addresses the audience for six minutes on a topic of their choice and responds to two questions, one from a member of the audience, the other from the Chairperson.The Expresser of Thanks reflects on the speech on behalf of the audience and expresses their gratitude to the Speaker. This may sound straightforward but is complicated by the fact that each Speaker joins a Chairperson and Expresser of Thanks from a dferent team.This means they have to be quick thinking and calm under pressure as they adapt to a Speaker whom they have never met before and a topic unfamiliar to them beforehand.Similarly, the Speaker has to answer questions without having any idea of their content in advance, which demands real depth of knowledge and understanding and the ability to be articulate and spontaneous.Concern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Public Speaking at Portadown College is mentored by Mrs Gladys Montgomery, Head of English.She is delighted with the success of her speakers, not only in this competition but also in the Soroptimist Public Speaking Competition and the Edgar Graham Memorial Public Speaking Competition which has been won by the College two out of the last three years.For her, winning is a bonus. Learning skills which are transferable to any real le environment and the experience of competing and meeting young people from other schools are what makes these events so worthwhile and enjoyable.On the secret of their success, she said, “In this case make sure you have a good team with the right people in the right place,“The people we have are just naturally talented.”Josh said, “We work with Mrs Montgomery to make sure we are confident in what we say,”Mrs Montgomery added, “In its delivery you need to have a rapport with the audience, I can gauge how people will react but these young people are extremely talented in their own right.”That delivery, she said, has to be confident without arrogance.On competition nerves, Joanna said, “No matter how many times you practice you still get nervous. We get an energy as a team so you can channel that.”As for preparation for the national final Mrs Montgomery said, “We will start once we know the date, we don’t want to peak too soon.”try catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoMassive lsquoholersquo reduced main Portadown thoroughfare to one laneInspirational Lurgan born nurse Tracey praises family and friends after TV show This Time Next YearDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probe          ..

Over .km of track will be relayed during a four-week closure period in July and August.In order to prepare for this however, there will be two scheduled weekend closures of the railway line at Lurgan during the weekends of - February and - March.These are to facilitate track drainage and associated level crossing works. These works will take place in the area between the William Street level crossing and Bell’s Row, and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience. These closures have been timed to minimise disruption for railway users and the wider community as far as possible.Bus substitutions will be in place between Lisburn and Portadown, calling at Lurgan, for both Enterprise and NI Railways passengers. After the second weekend closure during the weekend of - March, no further scheduled closures of the line are planned until the four-week closure running from  July– August, although site establishment and further preparatory works will take place throughout the spring and early summer. Over . million passengers use the Portadown Line every year, with almost one million journeys made to and from Lurgan Train Station annually – it is now one of the busiest stations on the NI Railways network.The work will see Translink remove current speed restrictions, helping to provide more efficient journeys while maintaining overall performance and high safety standards.The signicant investment in this project also secures the long-term sustainability of this section of the network and maintains vital cross-border connectivity in line with our Enterprise Strategic Development Plan. In the longer-term, this work will also reduce the level of maintenance required on the line, as well as contributing to the economic development of Lurgan and the surrounding area.The work represents the first phase of a number of planned strategic improvements within the Lurgan area over the coming years, subject to appropriate funding and permissions.These include an enhanced station, signalling redesign works and potentially improved park and ride facilities.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program.

Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds.

She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.

Lighthouse, based at Belfast’s Gasworks, is now available to let. The building includes , sq ft of grade A office accommodation with floor plates of just under , sq ft. The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
